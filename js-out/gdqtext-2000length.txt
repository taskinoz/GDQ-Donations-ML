Was going to donate, but forgot to do so during the event. Better late than never I guess!
Been watching for the past few years. Keep up the awesome work. More zelda the better 
This is fun and good to do.
Here hold 5 buck 
Good work
I can't bear to leave the donation total at such an uneven, ugly number. Ideally I'd like to have it at $1,300,000.00, but this will have to do. I love everyone involved with SGDQ, can't wait for AGDQ 2017!
Nevermind, I can't math. Here's another $5. Not that anyone will read this.
Is this still up? Here's another $5. Puts us over $1.3 mil.
Hey bros good luck on the runs,  kill the animals,  and... ok wait can I just say, like, real talk im gettin tired of reading all these donations. my voice hurts. i get NO RESPECT and im just done *get up and walk out donation person*
Glad to see some friends on the main stage this year. Props to all the great people in the community who make this wonderful event possible.
Caught my first GDQ last summer and instantly fell in love with it! First time donating, and certainly not my last! 
Well done all!
Loved the event! Can't wait till AGDQ in January. Good luck to MSF!
Thanks for a great event
It's been a fantastic show so far, keep it up everyone!
Work made it hard to watch the runners as much as I was able to last year. But I got to catch some of LackAttack's SMRPG. Lots of fun for an amazing cause. Best wishes, and always SAVE THE ANIMALS.
I'ma go practice Banjo Kazooie runs.
greate job, thanks to all the runners, organizers and ofcourse the doctors 
PEPSI-MAAAANNNNNN

Thank you for very awesome event for great cause. It's always a treat to watch games being destroyed in order to go fast. I hope everyone have been great week, i know my sleep cycle is upside down.  Community around speedrunners are amazing. It's cheerful to hear everybody reacting in such way if something happens in a run. Let's have a huge clapping to the runners, audience and the crew behind managing the event. 
Humble Bundle!
Always great to see a Mario 64 race. Thanks for the awesome event everyone! Greetings from germany.

We've been watching Games Done Quick for years now, and this is our first time donating. We know it's not much, but hopefully we can contribute more in the years to come. We also however think there's too much Mario going on right now, and we wanted to request for the crowd to let out one more cry for Waluigi before SGDQ comes to a close! "WAAAAAAAAHHHH!"
This is my third year watching SGDQ. I cannot express how important and wonderful this week --- this whole event has been to me. Yet, Doctors Without Boarders is so much more important to so many others in need around the world. Runners, you are our heroes.

Never forget that.

Also, WAAAAAAAAAAA
If you can't handle me at my diddliest, you dont deserve me at my doodliest. 
Thanks for a cool GDQ!
Ive got a whole bar here in downtown Austin, TX checking out the last run of the week. Good job to all tje runners this week. Ive got a group of us here willing to donate a dollarfor every pushup Binny can do after the run. Good luck! 
Never too late for small donation. The fianc√©e is mad at how you can gather 70 stars  so quickly while it took months for her to do so. Love what you guys do. Thanks for another amazing SGDQ. HYPE!
We're all rooting for Biinny here in the front row. Biinny and his perfect haircut. Stop letting puncay win dude!
Greetings from germanguy101. Long time watcher second ti... welll you get my drift.
Happy to donate to such a great cause.
I wish everybody a great summer, and hope both organizers and the runners give eachother a large pat on the back.
Oh yeah - also the crazy twitch chat.
Good job guys.
Squeezing in a donation before the end! Thanks for a ton of entertainment and all the hard work from everyone involved!
Here's to this last race, good job guys. Going the distance and not sleeping to finish this last race.
Just wanted to get my first donation for a GDQ before the event was over. Love what you guys do and am already excited for the next AGDQ! Donation goes to winners choice!
I made it in time! Amazing cause, amazing runners, amazing SGDQ!
Wanted to donate before it ended. Cheers for the awesome event. 
All I want to say is thank you to everyone who made this awesome event possible.
I just want to see the total say 1234567 for a second. Thanks to all of you for being so awesome. It's so good to see this many people come together and raise so much for MSF.
Shut up and take my last-minute donation. :)
Greetings from Germany
congratulations on the money, here's some more
Go Biinny!

Congrats everyone at SGDQ.  Another great event!
HELLO EVERONE!!!
So stoked that all four of you nailed early ellies!!! Good job, fam. Here's the extra 40, as promised!
Unlikely a small donation will get read this late in the marathon but in case it does I wanna say thanks so much to everyone; the runners, the organizers, the announcers, the tech team, everyone who helps put this amazing event together. I've been watching for 3 or 4 years now and it's truly inspiring to see. I look forward to these every year.
Well done to everyone involved in this incredible cause. The amount raised has defied all expectations. It is so great to see this simply amazing Super Mario 64 race, congratulations to all! WhAAAAAAAAAA!!
Give me your best Waluigi "WAAAAAAAAH"

Also Twitch Chat spam Klappa for this amazing race.  Fantastic way to close out SGDQ 2016
So glad that I get off of night shift early and have a chance to catch the SM64 run. Good luck to the rest of the runners. Game on! 
GDQ restores my faith in humanity. Much love to the staff, runners, viewers, supporters and the doctors. Love will always win.
EZ Follow YouTubeBrock, I'm the best
Im glad i got the chance  to see this year's  sgdq and agdq and because of that i will  do my usual  5.00 donation  to help thanks for this year's  sgdq and save the animals 
To this day, my cousin is still convinced that Mario says "Let's pickle" when entering stages.

This is my last donation of the marathon, thanks to all the runners, support staff, and donators. You all deserve a huge round of applause for all the good you've brought to this world.
My girlfriend and I are loving this race. Super Mario 64 made me want to become a professional game designer. Thanks to all the runners for blowing our minds on a Saturday night. 
I have been addicted to the stream all week. You guys did a great job for a great cause. Now take this fifty dollars to save the animals
Go, Biinny! Go Biinny! GO!   cheekyMIPS
Don't have much to give, but Mario 64 was a huge part of my childhood. It felt wrong not to give after seeing this race in action. Thank you all <3
Enjoying the race guys learning a lot of stuff i didn't know about mario 64 ggs, also stop making me stay up so late lol
This event has been awesome, I'm so glad I was able to catch it live this year.
You guys are awesome. I love watching runners that put all their effort in improving their times. If I had enough time I would try to pick up a game to run myself :) 
god speed you.
You've shown that playing video games is an act of love...so many nostalgic titles being done quick, while raising money for a great cause. Thank you!
CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG

I'm sad to see the event come to a close, but just so hype for going above and beyond last year's goal! Until winter comes, let's keep the gaming going and the speed running alive! Bless you all for your hard work and dedication, and see you in several months!
My name is A Joy. I've watched every day this week. I love games. Please announce me.
The hype for this race is so real that I had to donate again. Also Over Million Dollars HYPE
is mario the one with the mustache? 
First time watching SDGQ live, this run has been great and congratulations to all the runners and staff! It really makes military life more manageable as this was something to look forward to, and I definitely look forward to future runs.
Congratulations on breaking one million!  Can't wait until the next speed running event. This week has been a blast. Thanks for providing a way for gamers to come together and do something good for others!
Thank you!
Thanks MV and all the french restream team!

To all of the people at GDQ: Thanks for yet another great event and thank you for all the laughs and surprises you have provided for me. Here's to many more GDQs down the line and Super Mario 64 HYPE!  
I love Games Done Quick

Let's finish this with a blast

Also shoutouts to SimpleFlips
JUST IN TIME I HOPE
Puncay, Cheese, and Simply first got me into speedruns and I've never looked back. I'm always so excited for GDQ events and this year was no exception. Thanks to everyone for making this one so great. Now let's get some HYPE for this race.
Tell Simply I love him and Duluth loves him from Elliot
Already given several times this week, but what the heck, one more won't kill me. Good luck to all the racers!
Thanks for the amazing GDQ, keep up the good work!
This is sadly all I have right now, but I'd be sad not to donate more, especially for Mario 64
I am one of puncays subs!
Hey Puncay its me the wet wipe wizard here to give you god RNG for your sick URN!
I was looking forward to this GDQ the most since I've started watching GDQ's, but unfortunately I missed it all because sometimes life happens. I'm just glad I'm here to witness the end, and here's to many more. One love. 
I'd like to give a shout out to Support Class for their amazing on screen graphics the last few GDQs! Hope I'll be able to attend a GDQ next year!
Thanks for giving us nocturnal people something to do over the week. Im so happy to finally witness GDQ live. Here is to many more.
For the first time ever, I'm finally able to  donate after all these years of watching.  Thank you to all the staff that puts in all the hard work, and to everyone who has made it possible to break records for just playing a bunch of games.  Had to donate during my favorite speed run game, Mario64.  LETS GO PUNCAY!
I'm always so nervous about writing a comment. No amount of good words can justly highlight the good coursing through the life blood of these events. What a good predicament to be in. This world is made of love and peace!
DS DAD! You are wearing a wonderful green shirt today. We are so glad to see you here again and we, Twitch chat, would like it if you waved to the camera for us!
Love Games done quick! HYPE!
Wowza, my first time watching and I am blown away at this community coming together for such a great cause! Dobje mum, dobje chesch.  Much love!
My first live gdq thanks to all <3 
Thanks for cheering me up from a bad week. Speed runners were amazing and big shoutout to the SGDQ Staff for all there hard work and dedication!
I forgive you Mario. I watched SGDQ this week and I'm feeling the love!
I barely caught SGDQ this year because my big boy job has me working all week, but I would be remiss if I didn't donate. Not sure if the animals lived or were killed but oh well, super Mario RPG was fun to catch. Until next year!
I've made a lot of silly comments and jokes over the last week, but in my heart I love all of you. You guys are amazing, the staff, the runners, and the audience! Stay true to yourself!
Last minute donation. What an amazing event this year. Thanks and congrats to all the runners for their hard work.
I don't have a lot right now, but I'm happy to help with what I can. the GDQs are amazing and support amazing causes, thank you for hosting such an amazing event and bringing such an awesome community together.
I love you guys and what you do! Mario 64 race hype!!!
Greetings from Sweden!

I'm not able to donate much but I want to contribute to this great cause and help as much as i can. Thank you everyone for everything you do! 
First time donater, couple year watcher. Introduced to this awesome event by me ex, but definitely a positive memory that I haven't missed an AGDQ/SGDQ event since. Shout out to Sam Eustace from B.C, Canada.

This donation goes to Puncay's wet wipe fund and an all-around great event. Thanks to everyone that made this possible!
I want Mariooooooo!
Checked how much I've donated so far, and thought I'd make it a round 100. Awesome event, and I'm so hyped for the 64 run!
chesHeart
Super Mario RPG and Mario 64 back to back. Perfect way to end my Birthday. Keep up the great work.
I truly wish I could finish off by giving more, but this is all I can spare after all my other donations. Thanks for everyones time and effort to make these past few days amazing! Keep it up, can't wait for the next GDQ! 
I didn't need to sleep anyway, first time donating and I'm glad its going to a good cause
(Please read during Mario 64 intro, Island Hop is the first star!)

I've decided to donate extra this year based on how swag the Mario 64 goes. Runners, for each of you that even attempts Island Hop, I will donate an extra $10 each. I will also donate an additional $10 for each Lava Boost Early Ellies in Bowser in the Fire Sea. Good luck guys! It's been a blast hanging with you all week!
Loved watching all speed runs this week. This is a great marathon and even better that it goes to charity.  A big thank you to all the speed runners and their dedication. 
Glad I managed to catch GDQ again. I enjoyed it last time and am enjoying now.
PS. When I was a kid, I always dropped all the baby penguins off the edge in the snow level in Super Mario 64. 
Good luck to everyone!
Ty for playing one of my favorite games smrpg.
Hey guys, i've been watching all week and it's made my week off work amazing. I'd like to thank the staff, runners and everyone else for making this event worth watching. Unfortunately i'm needed back at work so i'll miss the finale. See you next GDQ. WAAAAAAHHHHH!
Been watching since 2014, always love the Super Mertroid 4 way speed runs, among others. Keep the good work, and HYPE for bonus streams comeback!

Thank you for doing this.
Rock on for donating your time and talent to raise money for Doctors Without Borders!


It was super awesome to see SMRPG ran with such precision.  I can't wait for our encore race of SM64.  Thank you Runners and Crew!  And I am happy to donate to such a worthy cause.  I hope to make it to both events next year.  This had made me get into running and I hope to join you all on the couch or in the hot seat!
We especially woke up to see the end of this awesome event, thank you for helping those awesome people from Doctors without borders <3
Last of the marathon, great runs this year and can't wait for AGDQ!
Let¬¥s go Finland. Meet you at the market!
Does it have to end? No it doesn't! Time to find the car keys, Drink Pepsi, and Speed Run myself.
Go go Mario!
Rock on! It's been another amazing week of speedruns and donations, let's close it out on a high note!
Can't stop, Won't Stop!
Money's tight this year, but I wanted to get something in. I'm so proud of everyone for coming together to for charity. As a soldier, I can tell you that NGOs like this are crucial for bringing aid and relief to disaster areas and war zones in ways that militaries just can't.

Shout-out to the announcer for doing a great job. Let's get these last donations in for Doctors Without Collision Detection!
Thank you for the wonderful week, of wonderful people doing wonderful things! This is the best I can comfortably donate, but someday I hope to give so much more!
Good cause, and good event!
<3
It's a drop in the bucket at this point, but currently it's all I can afford to give.

I genuinely think this was the best GDQ event yet and want to express my thanks.
Hi everyone first off chat needs to give themselves of clappas, and I wanted to say that it my first time attending the event and I definitely want to attend next year.
It's been a very emotional experience watching SGDQ this year and enjoying it with everyone else! Hoping this last run will be an thrill for everyone. Thank you all!

Thank you AGDQ for making being sick at home less sucky.

Congratulation on making the goal
That piano that you can't see, it used to scare me as a kid
Gotta get a last minute donation in! SGDQ was great and it always brings a slight tear to my eye when these events are over. Thanks to everyone who donated and to all the streamers, commentators and volunteers who make these events happen. Thank you everyone.
GDQ is such a great community, and everyone that helped make it happen or donated should feel great about themselves. Especially you if you're listening Lange; see you on stream for TotH soon you big softy.
Been watching GDQ events for years now and I've gotta wonder; am I the only one who gets teary eyed at the end of them? BibleThump
Well, have to give a last donation for a great event.
Go player 3 for the race, not sure why but player 3 always win.
Congratulations SGDQ, everyone there and watching is amazing.  SMRPG if the best video game of all time. Thank you for everything and keep changing the world with your amazing runs and kindness!
Keep upp the good work. 
This is a great event. This is a worthy charity. Thanks for all you do.
Had to donate for a great game!
Long-time watcher, first-time attending. Thanks to all of the staff and runners for a fantastic GDQ.
SGDQ and AGDQ are some of the few events I look forward the entire year (better than xmas yo!). 

I hope this donation helps with setting a new WR for donations. 

Keep being awesome!
Sending $20 from Sweden, first time for me following this event and I will definitely tune in next time as well!

Please don't sign off SGDQ BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
Awesome SGDQ this year; let's reach that goal!
Great event, and even though there is still a little left to go, I can say it was one of the best ones yet.  Watched as much as I could all week, and from the great runners to the excellent production value, there was always something to put a smile on mine, and everyone else's face.   Thanks so much for putting this on, and looking forward to all the new runners inspired from this week.  Speed on!
Hey!! You are awesome and its such a great cause! Thank you from germany
Love #GDQ, thank you from a viewer who loves what you do, AND how often the players invite people to join them in speed running. I love that welcoming attitude and it's one of the reasons I've been watching for a few years now!
CUP!
Great event! Specially loved the SMRPG run. 
I only started watching these marathons a year ago but now I'm hooked and can't stop watching them. Thanks for all the amazing runs.
Greetings from down under,  Super Mario 64 is my favourite game, and i always love to see people perfecting it. GDQ's are always fun to watch and a great way to raise money. Good luck with the run.
One more to make it 150 even. HYYYYYYPE!!!!
TEAM MYSTIC!!!
SGDQ, what is good in life? To crush your previous year's funding goals, see mario64 played before you, and hear the songs of your speed runners.
Last minute donation for you guys being awesome. Party on and keep making a difference.
I have never donated but this is my 3rd time watching the marathon.  Thanks to all the entertainment this week. I had a rough week of work, but knowing I could come home and watch the marathon helped.
For Old Man River
Long time watcher, first time donating -- What a fantastic event, props to every runner this week, my wife Lisa and my girls, Gwen and Roxy, had a blast watching this week, and can't wait for the next GDQ. You guys do so much good for charity, it's amazing.
Great GDK this year.  Always glad to stave off work to watch this every six months.
Woooo! Last minute! 5 bucks for all the games! 5 bucks for everything and all!
Love the amount of dedication and time you guys put in.  Here's to helping an awesome cause!
<3
It's been amazing watching all the cool runs! And such a great evening to conclude on with Mario RPG. Glad to see SM64 70 star race made it. Good luck & thanks to all the runners for a great show!
Just reminding that we are only 5k away from a 8 million total over GDQ events! Come on, we can do this!
Great work! Now, SMRPG low level run hype?
Shave the animals.
Hey guys!

I've been watching the GDQ events for around 3 years now and thought it was about time for me to donate, even if just a little bit.

Greetings from Brazil.
Thank  you all for providing a place for us to donate.  The fact that this goes to a good cause is why I am happy to send money.  You all are what we gamers should aspire to be.

Thank You
Thanks everyone. You're all amazing!
Loved watching these streams but only now am I able to lend a hand to the cause. Well done to everyone!
Just putting in some last minute cash! I haven't gotten to donate yet so I'm fixing that!
Sm64 all day baby. WAHHHHHHH
First time watching SGDQ live. Can say i was not dissapointed. Wish I had donated earlier, but better late than never.
Because you didn't get enough feebies, I decided to give 5 dollars to each feebies in the run. Here you do!
Congrats to Lack Attack for a successful SMRPG run
Great run! Hype to see Super Mario 64 after this and of course hear pie sing Old Man River.
Loved watching the runs this year so decided to donate, this year's SGDQ was great!
Great Speedruns and a great cause! Always a pleasure to tune into the Games Done Quick community and experiencing these great speedruns through a great community!
Thank you for SGDQ for a wonderful marathon to bring my whole family together for an interest in gaming.  Quick shout out to all of them: Raine, Leighton, Savannah, and Torin.  Woot-Woot SGDQ!!  Can't wait for the next one.
This game is the best of Weeeeeeeh. I still remember renting a N64 and taping our gameplay to watch it inthe days after. Here's some money towards the 64 run. GO MEMORIES. (weeeh)
Here's to passing last year's total!
*one up sound*
Just reminding Lack how much damage he's supposed to do with super jumps.  This is for the D!!!
Been watching for a few years, first time donating. Great cause, great event! Thanks to all the runners and everyone who helped make it great!
Donating to bump that final donation count up a bit! This year was my first GDQ I attended in person and I look forward to many more. Good luck Lackattack!
Sick super jumps!!
First time donating to this keep up the great work 
I love you SGDQ
1.22 million HYPE! Amazing job on this run, lack! So much fun to watch with all the new strats since Checkers' run in 2015. WAAAAAAH
Just finished my work week not too long ago and wasn't able to watch the marathon all week like I used to. But coming home to see what the speedrun community can do for others puts a huge smile on my face. Thanks to everyone who contributed in anyway during SGDQ! <3 FrankerZ
Long time watcher, first time donating -- What a fantastic event, props to every runner this week, my wife Lisa and my girls, Gwen and Roxy, had a blast watching this week, and can't wait for the next GDQ. You guys do so much good for charity, it's amazing.
So glad to be up watching the end of SGDQ. Hooray for beating last year, and hooray for more Mario!
[[ IIIII FEEEEEEL....HAPPY? ]]

You cannot comprehend the true form  of this donation.
I should go to bed, but the jumps keep drawing me in.
come on put mallow in.
Hey everyone, great job on surpassing the last goal. Hopefully, we can do the same at AGDQ 2017. I donated at the very beginning of the marathon; while 5.00 is not a lot, I still felt compelled to give just that little bit extra like everyone else.
Let's make next year's SGDQ goal even higher!
I almost forgot to donate. I'll remember to donate more during AGDQ! Great work, guys! 
Just woke up and heard something about singing. I want to hear singing.
HYPE PogChamp
We Did It Y'all ! ! !
$1.2Mil WE MADE IT!! 
So amazing. Really a giant thank you to everyone involved.
Thanks GDQ for an amazing marathon! 

Already donated my limit, but we need to blow that record out of the water! Here's my contribution.

I can't wait for the next GDQ event (especially if Yoshi's Woolly World gets on the schedule!)

Thank you to all the runners, fans, announcers, and crew for an awesome job. You rock!
Only been following on twitter, but wanted the fun to continue for you guys. Here's to the Mario 64 4-way race!
Go mario go!
Great job guys, this is a great cause and great runs 
Just like every GDQ, this one is blowing my mind! A big thanks to all the runners, staff, and folks watching and donating. You're all my heroes!
I wish i could give more for my first time donating but i made a promise to donate this year  and there is no way im not going to participate  in this amazing event! 
Missed most of the runs I was looking forward to, due to work and real-life, but I'm going to watch the YouTube replays!
S/o to everyone who made this fundraiser possible!
We just broke the record so let's set a new one! Don't stop now!
Better late than never <3
You cant finish a GDQ without donating! Keep it ups guys, thanks for this Great Event 
We broke the record!
I've been watching all week and Doctors Without Borders is a great group.
Gotta contribute to this amazing run. Thanks to everyone that has done their part to make this event happen.
The past couple of weeks have proven trying times for many. Yet amidst that a light has shined, a community united to celebrate the skills of many while simultaneously raising money to make a difference in the world. Thank you all who have participated in this event, whether as organizers, runners, or spectators. It's been great.
Keep it up! Almost there
For the record! WAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Awesome event, great cause, fun times all around. Congratulations to everyone who helped pull this off. And remember, the cake is a lie!

I'm unemployed and homeless. Been watching these speedruns for the past week through the free wifi at our local starbucks and, after 10pm, the bar. Thanks for making my summer just a little bit more happy.

SGDQ HYPE!
Doing my part to keep this marathon even just a LITTLE bit longer!
I've watched archives of previous GDQ events, but this is my first year watching live and first donation, this whole week has been mind-blowing, I'm already so excited for the next one. Let's get that last incentive and break that record!
Hello! Great work once again, everyone!
Here's five dollars.

If everyone else watching who can afford $5 donates, we'll hit the goal for sure.
Waaaaaaaah
Such an amazing event from start to finish, and what an triumph with the amount donated this year.

Fantastic SGDQ this year.  Never fails to amaze me how closely knit and dedicated the community is toward the games that helped define childhoods.  First time donating to charity this year, and I could not think of a better time to donate.  Lets reach that goal!
I love Super Mario RPG and I love these events! I'm in the Army and I really appreciated your professionalism (even though it's mostly just for fun) and dedication to your skills. Furthermore the staff for their work for this cause.  KEEP IT UP MEN! HUA!
One more game please. Also Fizz is a nerd.
I'll double down on this donation if you pronounce my name correctly.
Super Mario 64 HYYYYPPPPEEEEEE!!!

Thank you for all of the fun all week! God bless :)
Puncayshun is the guy that first introduced me to speedrunning. Gotta see him win this SM64 70-star!
Joel get on Skype 
This has been the first games done quick that I've caught as it's happening and outside of messing with my sleep cycle, has been a lot of fun to watch. Thanks to all the folks involved from running to facilitating those runs.

Glad to support a great cause!
SGDQ2016 has been a blast, and if we can extend it a little further that'd be the best!
I've donated every GDQ, even when I couldn't afford it, so now I can, I can't not donate. I didn't get to watch as much as I wanted due to work, but it did provide the money to donate.

 I love everything you guys do and thanks to not only the runners, but the announcers, the sound crew, the audio crew, the techs, everyone else involved in running the GDQs and most importantly, EVERY SINGLE viewer and donator. We couldn't do this without you!
You're all lovely. <3
Donators can set records too.
Let's do it!

Thank you to all of the runners, and everyone behind the scenes for providing quality entertainment this past week. I don't have much money but I wanted to do my part! Super Mario 64 needs to happen! Love you all!
I think as incentive, Lackattack should agree to drink a died Pepsi on stream if SGDQ 2015 is beaten. Pepsimannnnnn!!!!
CHAT TAKE MY ENERGY!!!! And by take my energy I mean... MATCH MY DONATION!!!!  We can do this with the power of FRIENDSHIP MingLee
This has been an amazing week, and SMRPG is the perfect way to cap it off. Thanks to all the runners for their great performances!
An amazing SGDQ this year. Congrats to all the runners and to everyone behind the scenes. This SGDQ also helped me cope with the death of my 12 year old cat, Midnight. May he rest in piece.
Little late for the mine cart, but great run today, on my favorite Mario game all time.
Thanks for making the a better place. 
Those jumps tho. 
Mario is a god.
yay charity!
Let's go everyone! I'm giving more than what I probably should, but it's all for an amazing cause. Let's  get one more run to end it with a bang! 
Just recently discovered SGDQ and am pumped to see my first live event!  Would've donated more, but I didn't win MegaMillions last night.  Next time!
Thanks for all the hype SGDQ!  Very glad to donate to this cause!
This is all I can afford, fight me irl

Getting that last chance for donations in. Thanks for a great SGDQ this year! 
Thanks for the brilliant week, Pity Aus$ money doesn't go further.  We can do it!
To heck with it here's five more! What an amazing event as always. Thanks everyone for such a great week :)
Have watched the last 5 GDQ events, I have always loved Super Mario RPG was the first RPG that I ever played so I figured It would be a good time to donate. Was a blast to watch AGDQ again this year, can't wait for the next event.
Donating for a great cause. 
Guys, give Goku your energy, raise your dongers... do anything! We gotta hit this goal!

Wait! Do the thing that matters: Donate!
JUST DO IT!
I brought the Shake now you all bring the bake
OLD MAN RIVER HYPE
Lack, I'm having a lot of fun watching this run, but I gotta ask you, when are we gonna see a run of Big Nose the Caveman at a GDQ? :)
Never had a SNES to play SMRPG as a kid, but a pleasure to watch all the same!  Old Man River + SM64 HYPE~!
It's 12:00. It's High Noon.

A line you probably haven't heard in a long time.
Hey guy! Thank you for doing this wonderful event. I haven't been able to follow all of it this week. Glad everything is being uploaded to youtube so I can watch these on my own time :) I was waiting until Mario RPG to donate for those awesome Geno and Mallow plushies! Keep up the good work.
This is one of the hypest events I've  ever had the pleasure of watching, and I don't want this to end! Let keep this donation train rolling everyone!
I don't have as much as this Anonymous guy; he just keeps giving these huge amounts. But here's what I can give for now. Been watching for years now. Hope to make it out in the future and give more when I can!
Make America Great Again!
GOGOGO
The longer this run is, the more time there is to reach the goal. It is time for Summer Games Done... Eventually. Tell Lack to take his time.
I loved SMRPG so much. Although I would have to say that The Thousand year door is a the best Mario RPG. Chill out, relax. AND SM64 RACE HYPE!
Missed most of it throughout the week but had to come for the end!
Here is my contribution to extending SGDQ.  Thank you to everyone who puts this on.  It is awesome to see such a great community come together for a great cause.
I gotta say, such an insanely good event. From the hilarity of the Jak and Daxter run and the Sonic 06 - to the technical skill and knowledge of the Deus X run and the Reze's Low percent. I just had to be apart of the final push! Mario 64 HYPE
Looking forward to that Mario 64 race. We're almost there!
It turns out that creatures need memories so that they can perform wrong warps.
This has been an amazing week and it's time to cap it off with even more Mario!  Thank you, everyone!
Every little bit helps us get to the Mario 64 race. Shoutouts to Alice!
Congrats to everyone who made this week a success. 
Awesome week, awesome people, awesome games, awesome cause. To sum up GDQ in one word: HYPE.
Love SMRPG & have loved yet another GDQ. Here's one more donation in honor of everyone involved in the event, and for the great cause it represents.

Thanks everyone, and see yall next GDQ!
More mario please! 
Let's do this guys!
80$ for next year's save the animals!
Awesome event, awesome cause, thanks to the runners, announcers, and everyone who makes these events happen. 
I know it's not much, but i hope this helps. Thanks for the unforgettable week, and heres hoping for the great end to the run.
If even 1% of people watching now were to donate at least $5, we would blow this total goal out of the water
Races are the best
Sorry I can't give more, I'm a poor uni student.  BibleThump
is that the beautiful runescape player? The one in blue in the middle?
I took this week off from work and have had this stream on the entire time. I've enjoyed every minute of it but don't want it to end after this SMRPG run - bring on SM64! HYPE!
Lets get there!
Mario RPG? How could I not.
I admit it, I was one of those people that watched hours and hours of great runs without donating. I'm making amends and putting some money towards an amazing cause. 

Everything is fine!
Having a great week, haven't donated yet though so fixing that now. Here's to seeing that SM64 race!
I just got home from my very first GDQ. It was an honor and a privilege to attend and run in an event filled with so many wonderful people.

As much as I think the perfect end to the marathon is the one true Final Fantasy, Mario RPG, we can't let it end just yet. Let's get that race underway!
It's been a great SGDQ but why stop now? 
This is the part where everyone chips in, right? Well, I guess I'm part of everyone.
Gotta donate for both my favorite Mario game being destroyed as well as getting Super Mario 64 to be ran. Let's go Puncayshun. Yum!
If everyone donated a dollar for every bounce lack does this run then that would raise.. Umm.. A lot of money and I don't feel like doing math so SUPER MARIO 64 HYPE
I'm donating to keep the Speedrunning going as long as possible. A week of SGDQ is not enough. that Mario 64 run is so close I can taste it. 
Let's go 7 star! we can do this!
My girlfriend and I bonded over this game when we first started dating, and tonight I've finally got her to sit down and watch her first speed run events. 

We wanted to send in what we could to support a great cause and to say thanks for giving us something to bond over again. 
PPMD Kreygasm
Come on chat lets get this done
Why can't I find the Zelda Randomizer donation incentive?

I mean... Good luck Lackattack!  
It's 2am, time to beat a record!
Dooo. Eeeettttt. 
SMK64 LETS GOOOO
Holla from Japan!! My boyfriend made me watch SGDQ but I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute!! Thanks for the great plays all!
Thanks to all the runners and crew for another week of scintillating content in service of charity. You're an inspiration for gamers everywhere!
thanks to all the runners, commentators, support staff and viewers for an excellent SGDQ! so much #Hype
Not ready for it to all be over, one more game!
Thank you to everyone involved in the GDQ events. Great speedruns for a great cause. P.S. COME ON CHAT, DONATE! WE CAN DO IT! 4Head
it's around 8am here in Denmark, and I must cure my hangover with  a Super Mario 64 race
Thought I was done donating, but they threw in that SM64 curveball. It must happen. Come on guys, you can throw in another dollar or two! You don't want it to end, do you?
OH WOW DO YOU SEE THE TIME ON THE CLOCK

THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO DONATE
GOGOGO
Games done quick has entertained for years and here's to it going for many more to come. Have to give a shout out to the Guildhall Podcast for getting me into it.
Hello announcer!
Haven't seen that much GDQ, but it's always a fun time when I do,  so here's my first donation to meet the goal.
Great event I've seen so far! Even though I haven't been able to watch every run due to work, It has been a blast for every moment I've watched. Keep up the good work!
for more mario
This is only five dollars, but it is worth 70 stars if we can all pitch in a five dollar donation each. Let's do this!
Wait, you're telling me that Mallow isn't a frog..? Next thing you'll be telling me is that Green Mario is named something ridiculous like "Luigi." 

You guys are doing great! Let's get that Super Mario 64 donation goal met and shatter the old SGDQ record!!
My part to that Mario 64 run. Come oooon, Old Man River!
This is my first ever GDQ and it's absolutely amazing.  Thanks to everyone for putting on a fantastic show!
Looks like you still need some help setting a new record. Take this.
Sorry I can't add in more! But here's ten dollars for the SM64 cause! Shout out to the runners, you're doing great! Good luck, guys. Let's hit that goal and see more more more Mario!
More SGDQ!
I challange every single soul watching to donate at least 5$ !   I'll kickstart 100$ to get the ball rolling!
Here's to a great cause, and a great gaming exhibition! Let's make this well worth the time of everyone watching, everywhere in the world!

It took me over a decade to finally get back to Super Mario 64 and get all 120 Stars after I first played. Watching a race to 70 would be more than worth the nostalgia.
I'm so glad I'm in a position to be able to give even a bit back to SGDQ for all the hours of entertainment and good it's brought me and thousands of others. Thanks for the amazing event!
WE WANT SUPER MARIO 64!
And more than anything else, we want more money for MSF!
Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Im just donating so i can watch an SM64 race. (also to help out a good cause and for the hype)
Long live Doctors Without Borders and their patients! GDQ events are fantastic charity events, and everyone involved should be proud of themselves. Big round of applause and Klappas in Twitch chat for Doctors without Borders, GDQ organizers, and runners! We got this!
I'll match your minimum by 130%
thanks for the great week! :)
this SGDQ was A-Mei-Zing! so many entertaining runs and runners and so much generosity for a great cause. Everybody part of this deserves some high 5s! Penguins shoutout!
Old man river hype!
Donating $10 because someone in chat said they wanted to but could not afford it.
Guys, you aren't seriously going to let those people who ran SGDQ 2015 beat us here, are you? Let's GO!
I'm very proud of all of the runners and every GDQ event makes me happy that so many people are willing to take time out of their lives to help raise money for a worthy cause.

Also, I need 70 star race please.
now seems like the time to get one last minute donation in. SM65 HYYPPEE
clabe
I would be remiss to be watching this all week and *not* donate. Good luck reaching a new top donation total!
Cheers from Japan.
I can afford to eat sandwiches for a couple more days to finally get a donation in to GDQ. You sure know how to tug at a poor college student's heart with Super Mario RPG.
Can't give much, but I will do what I can.
Here's to Mario, my entry into gaming and I have to keep coming back for more. Let's keep these donations coming!
Thanks for taking me back to my grade school days!  I enjoy the commentary.  Keep up the awesome work!
Go!
Been watching all week, and usually have this on the background every year.  Here's to beating 2015!

Been watching all week, figure I should finally donate before SGDQ 2016 ends. It's not much, but every little bit helps! Thanks everyone!
This is my third time watching GDQ. You guys are doing wonderful work while giving me some of the greatest entertainment on the internet. I mean, where else will you get Pepsi Man! Let's get this final goal done and help those Doctors across those borders.
TY For the awesome week!

Ok, I seem to be asked to donate ... and damn I have no self control ;)
Great marathon; as always ;) finally ending :(
I've been watching GDQ since about 2013 but, now that I'm out of grad school and no longer disgustingly poor, I can finally donate!  I wanted to donate sooner but I kept passing out on the couch when the games I wanted to donate during were on... sorry about that. This is an amazing thing that you all pull  and I hope to continue watching for years to come. 
Loved SMRPG when I was growing up, still get excited when I pick it up now. Felt the need to donate to support a great cause, and because the Geno and Mallow plushies are so cute! Good luck on the rest of the run, kick Smithy's butt!
This run sponsored by Blockbuster Video. Best of luck to lack attack and mention GDQ at your local blockbuster tomorrow for a free video rental if lack PBs!
Loving this Super Mario RPG run! Thanks SGDQ for what you all do and thanks being a way for my brother and I to connect many many miles away! Also Pie how much do we need to give to have the announcer sing with ya? Money for 70 star race.

This was my first GDQ that I attended, and it was an absolute blast.  Thanks to all the runners for sharing their knowledge and skills about all the games, and a huge thanks to the staff who made sure everything ran smoothly.

For Liz
Saw the counter at 1,182,990 - couldn't help but put in enough to round out that number :)
Great marathon this year guys! Heres to the bonus 70 star. HYPE!
This has been an amazing SGDQ. Thanks to all the runners for the awesome runs. I wasn't able to catch everything live, but I'll watch the recordings of the things I missed. Here's my contribution to beat last year's donation total!

WE NEED SM64
Second Donation this SGDQ C'MON GUYS LETS BEAT LAST YEAR!
let's get SM64
Let's make this Super Mario 64 run happen! Thanks for a great SGDQ and to everyone supporting a great cause!
This GDQ has inspired me to finally get into speedrunning. Thank you for all the amazing entertainment this past week! RIP the animals :(
First Time watching, first time donating. Keep up the good work, much respect. Come on twitch chat, we can do this! SM64 Hype!
but before we reach our goal, we have to talk about parallel universes
I don't have much, but donating $5 for the second time. Come on everyone, we can do this! 
TAKE MY STRENGTH
ONE MORE GAME. ONE MORE GAME.
Every year we'm amazed by GDQ, from the runners crushing so many games, the entire community (WORLD!) raising so much money, and all the folks working behind the scene for such a great cause. Here's my last donation for tonight and this year. Let's finish strong and get all 70 stars!!! 
Mario Yippee 
MUST HAVE SUPER MARIO 64 RACE!!!!!!!!!!
Shoutout to Pie on the couch and heres to a run with good Super Mario RNG!
Our progress has been remarkable, but the fight is not over.  There's still one more goal for us to reach, and I know that we can do it.

Now is the time to act. If everyone in chat donated just $5 right now, we'd be well over our goal.  Whether you have good taste or demon tendencies, love or hatred of animals, we can put aside these differences to unite to help SAVE the world.  

This is Uncle Samus, and I want YOU to donate $5.
Thank you all for an awesome week. Got to watch GDQ with my 11 month old son, and he loved watching the different games.  Great memories made and I can't wait for AGDQ in January. 
Doctors without borders, so this donation is too.
Let's keep donating i know we can get the race to happen!
!
We can totally make it! Thanks for running my one of my favorite games of all time, let's make it to the SM64 run!
With the way things are going right now in Dallas and unfortunate situations that escalated, this is a good way to put some good into the world and at the same time watching some sick games being broken. Never donated before but I plan on doing so from now on. Keep up the good work, homies. Much love. 
I <3 you Boo
Without a doubt, Super Mario RPG is the most fun you can have on the SNES. I remember every single detail of this run, and I haven't  played it through in at least 10 years. Shoutout to the 502 Krew, Lack, and the couch for their incredible commentary.
Don't ask for much, but can Calebhart42 lift Pie for gains and help MSF?
COME ON!
EVERYONE, LEND THE DOCTORS YOUR POWER

DONOR BOMB
Would love to see last year's GDQ donation total get broken, and i'm not planning on sleeping any time soon, would love to see a smb64 run.  WAH!
As a pro game developer, I love the reactions in the studio office when we watch one of our games get destroyed by these amazing runners. Shoutouts to the tech crews, announcers, and behind the scenes people keeping this awesome show going.
It's only a little, but I want to do my part to make SM64 happen.  Lets do this!
I rarely get the chance to see the event out like this, and I'm psyched that it's ending with an amazing game. Much love.
We could hit the donation goal right away if about 6000 of us out of the 100 thousand plus watching donated 5 dollars. Let's do it boys! Speaking as a poor student, even our little donations can make a difference, both here and for people around the world.

For SM64 race
I'm sitting here watching all these $500 and $1000 donations coming in and thinking that there's no point in giving just $5. But then I saw that there are over 100,000 people watching on Twitch. If only a tenth of you give $5 then we'll blow past our goal. Please, if you can, DONATE DONATE DONATE!  I want to see Super Mario 64!
Thanks for letting me relive my fav game of all time!

Donating for a great event put on by a great community to support an even greater cause. Congratulations to all the runners!
Thanks for the amazing event! And for the amazing run! I wonder what would happen if everyone watching put in $5... i'm sure it would make the tracker go "WAAAAAAAAAH"
To answer Mallow's question, we are Bruce Lee and we'll smash that 64 k. Geno whirl hype.
I usually give 50$ per GDQ, upping by 5 for the sub 2 minutes mini game. Awesome week!

SGDQ is a fantastic event for a fantastic cause.  Now let's hit that SM64 goal!
Match me if you can!
I already donated a few times, but five dollars is a pittance for chat to pay for the SM64 race.

C'mon, you miserly bums! It's five bucks! You can find that in your couch cushions!

$5 each or r9k mode!
Thanks to all of the runners for an awesome week of entertaining runs!
last effort to get another game run
We're so close, we can be heroes today! Not the heroes the world deserves, but the heroes the world needs! Put your wallets up, chat, and give your energy to MSF!
You had me at Old Man River.

I hadn't donated yet, but getting that 70 star run is too good to pass up. Extra 20 for getting sheep attack.
Not much but doing my part. Come on SMB 64! Hype!
I just started watching speed runs and have been loving them. I just found out they were held for a charity called doctors without borders. I did research on them  and they seem like a great charity, with a great cause. Thanks for a great event!
For SM64 and Great Justice

Hey All, Yetee Glen here. I don't have any more shirt money, but I'm happy to throw my own to see that BLESSED SM64 Race. Please guys. We can do this, you gotta believe!
Super Mario RPG is one of the few RPGs I've ever played, and now you guys are making me super nostalgic for my childhood.
Oh my god! They Killed Geno!
I remember when this event was like 15 dudes in a basement and they raised like 9 grand. Even back then you could feel the magic of the event. I as with many others anticipate every GDQ. They're very special and words do little to describe the gravity around them. Gdq is my Super Bowl. Mario Rpg is my favorite game, thank you all for everything. MARIO 64 HYPE!
This is the last of my donation funds! Here's to an awesome SMRPG run and to the SM64 race! 
SGDQ has been amazing this year, and this SMRPG has been insane! Congrats to all the runners, and big thanks to the staff and volunteers at SGDQ. You all do something so nobel by showing your love for going fast in games. 

This is for SM64 race, and to beat SGDQ2015! :D
I donated 5 dollars for the mine cart time, but I got a freebie! So I'm donating five bucks again. SM64 HYPE!
OLD MAN RIVER
Just doing my part in this, despite how small it may be. Here's to everyone at the event and for such a fun and interesting week. And here's to that bonus incentive.

Someone mentioned something about pie and someone eating mine so here's a cool twenty to make sure this guy has a good night...

Old Man River!!! 
It's not much, but here's hoping we get that bonus Mario 64 race!
This is probably my favorite RPG of all time, and one of my favorite Mario games. Thanks to all the runners this week and the crew!

I have been watching GDQ since 2014 when i stumbled upon it on twitch, i was blown away and have watched every event since. It is about time that i donated as i am finally done university and actually have some money to put towards the cause. Thank you all for putting on such an amazing show.
Those jumps are incredible. Thanks for destroying my favorite SNES game. Thanks to all the amazing people  who put this wonderful event on each year.
I'm a vegan so don't tell anybody I said... I'm glad the animals died. M64 race hype!

Axem fight destroyed me as a kid, good to see a but of payback! Thanks Lack! 
Come on guys, if even 10% of chat donated $5, we could BLOW past the final donation incentive!
I absolutely loved Super Mario RPG as a kid, and I was so excited to grab it on my WiiU last week. Here is $5 so that not only do we get more games, but we get more viewers, therefore more donations towards a spectacular cause. Can we get some HYPE in the Showroom?!?!
If everyone in chat donates 5 dollars, we'll make it ezpz
This week has been incredible and the cause is amazing! Way to go!
No way we're not getting that race ! Everybody ask for your mom's credit card and donate. Waluigi counts on you.
I remember back in the late 1900s when I first played Super Mario 64 myself.  It was a special time back then.  You could go outside at night and leave your doors unlocked.  But you didn't.  Because you were playing Super Mario 64.  SM64 HYPE!
Been watching SGDQ with my 1 year old daughter who always stops to applaud the speedrunners along with the crowd. Thanks for doing this and being wizards!
Hey, This stream's better good!

Super Mario RPG is my favorite speed run to watch! Thanks so much to all the organizers and runners. This event makes me so proud to be a total geek.

Good luck Lack!
Give til it hurts...the animals
Finally donating after watching for a few years. Love the speed running community, keep plowing through these video games.
Super Mario RPG is a good way to round out an awesome week of speed running. But you know what would be a better way to end it? SUPER MARIO 64!!! Good luck to LackAttack on his run and  a big thanks to all of the GDQ crew for a job well done.
Super Mario RPG is one of those games that I just never quite finish. Good to watch the parts I missed in under 4 hours. 
I love Shy Guys! Oyasumi nasai!
Woot super mario 64

We need to unlock the Super Mario 64 race just so we can see how fast everyone can complete the secret slide!
Thank you GDQ, for everything. Let's see a 70 star race.
Awesome week, let's beat our PB and get Mario 64!

Also, shout out the awesome crowd who are still going strong.

Bust that record.
I have been glued to SGDQ all week. Thank you so much for putting on an amazing stream for a great cause.
I donated $20 earlier  this week and I needed to add even more. I think Super Mario RPG has a special place in my heart. I'm super happy to be watching this. Thanks to all the runners and everyone else who volunteered and participated at the gdq!! Give me a WAAAH Everyone!
GDQ makes me so proud to be a part of the gaming community. Look how much good we can do! I've been watching all week, and I had to donate again to help push for Mario 64. Thanks to everyone involved; you should be so proud of what you're doing. Much love to my GT chat and Easy Allies friends! <3 
We're in that "if everyone watching gives a dollar..." range.  Let's make it happen people!
Doing what I can for SM64. Come on, everyone, please make it happen!
Need to see that SMB 64 race.
waaahhh need more mario!!!
First time donating, GDQ has seen me through some tough times.  Thanks for all you do!  :D
Just want to thank everybody that takes part in GDQ. I've been watching for about 4 years now and its always a great time. Money goes towards SM64 race.
Although small, I had to donate before the end of the event. I encourage everyone watching to do the same!
We're so close! Let's bust that donation we made back in 2015 wide open! Keep it up Lack! GDQ HYPE!
Always look forward to GDQ, keeps me entertained for an entire week, then I get to watch the VODS for everything I missed. I appreciate all the dedication and hardwork that all these speedrunners put in and all the effort that goes in for this Charity event is awesome! Keep up the good work guys and I'll keep watching!
Shoutout to all the great runners who've made this event fun, shoutout to lack, good luck on sub 3 hours, and shoutout to sarah! Here's to seeing that mario 64 run!
All was peaceful in the Mushroom Kingdom until Smithy the sword shattered the Star Road! Wow!! So with his old enemy Bowser and a marshmallow who throws lightning, HAHAHAHA, Mario fought evil wedding cakes, and killer Venus Fly Traps, and recovered the 7 STARRRRSSSS!!!
 Great cause, great runs, I don't want it to end, let's beat last year's mark!  We need MORE MARIO! IN 64 BITS!
SMRPG was the first speedrun I saw at pie's stream,  and it's introduced me to the GDQ's and speedrunner's community that I've come to enjoy the company of. Glad to donate for a good cause. Rest in peace Mallow Route pieBleThump.
It'll be my 5th donation of the marathon, but I CAN'T miss an SM64 race. Let's meet that incentive so no one has to cry ~WAAHH~
This event has been incredible! Shout out to all you lovely runners out there and to everyone who made this possible. Let's get that Mario 64 run going.
Might have missed most of this gdq, but I made it for the last. Cheers.

7th GDQ event, and the end always makes me weepy.  Lets keep it rolling with some sweet  sweet 64
Long time watcher, first time donating. I had a really rough week and SGDQ helped a lot through this tough time. Thanks to everyone involved. Let's beat last years record! Hype!
lana...Lana...LANAAAAA.  Something, something, danger zone.  
I enjoy watching SGDQ every year. Thank you to everyone behind the scenes and of course the speedrunners themselves.
Do you want SGDQ to end without one more run?  Come on Twitch Chat.  Come on NeoGAF.  Come on Reddit.  We can do this!  Let's break the record!
Hey guys. Nearly forgot to donate before the end! That would have been terrible! Anyways, not sure if there are any donation incentives left, but if there are, put this towards runners choice.
Last donation for the week! Loved watching all the great runs! Great job runners, and thanks, GDQ, for hosting such a great event as always! Let's get this SM64 bonus! Looking forward to AGDQ '17!
gotta get that donation in this year, great job everyone
sm64 !!!!!!!
Love what you do and look forward to next GDQ already.
SM 64!
It's a me! One hundred bucks. Here some scratch for that Mario 64 run~
dat race
There's been a lot of bad in the world lately, and things like this help me remember there's still good in this world. And it's worth donating for.
Thanks to everyone for an amazing SGDQ. Good luck to Lack on his run.
SM64 let's do it!
I'm making it happen!
This is a little late, but I was busy playing Overwatch! Add this $5 to the $275 you all collected earlier.
I've been meaning to donate all week, but could never quite decide what incentive to vote for. Little late now, but better late than never I guess.

Thanks to everyone for an amazing week of entertainment, and let's get that encore run!
Let's get that SM64 run going!
The game of my childhood! Hopefully this comment gets read during the Nimbus Land segment, as that was always my favorite part of the game. Thank you for giving me an evening of nostalgia.
First time watching live and I had to donate. Thanks to all the runners and organisers for the great work you do.
Love everything you guys do and stand for!  I wanted to donate during one of the best SNES games ever and thank you for letting me relive my childhood for a good cause.  Keep up the awesome work and good luck on the remainder of your run!
Good luck on the run Lack. Shout out to the couch full of awesome people. Love, your favorite Sandwich.
As promised here's a little more for sub 10 sky troopas, yall gotta understand how hard that is, shotuouts to Lack for the Sunkin Ship jump and the run, and everyone couching! GL GL GL!
Xenophon, don't get too drunk at the card store tonight! Also, yay, MSF! Woo...
I tried to resist, but I really want to see another beautiful Super Mario 64 race - here's $10 and some hopes and dreams.

Cheers!
IF EVERYONE WATCHING IN TWITCH CHAT  DONATED THE MINIMUM AMOUNT, WE WOULD REACH THAT BONUS! GO GO GO, DONATE NOW FOR SMW64!
i haven't donated yet this marathon, so i had to pitch in during the final run.  let's beat that record and get some mario 64!
Hey there!  Been watching for a few years now, and it's always fun to see the runners crushing these games for charity.  Best of luck!
Thanks for putting on such an awesome event again.  What a great community and what a great cause to support.
Really want to see a race!!! And a great charity. Game on
I want those awesome prizes!
Why?  To match Pie of course.
Shoutouts to my sister, Mandy!  She's the super-est Super Mario RPG fan and I know this run means a lot to her.  She's been the best gaming buddy this big brother could have asked for.  Love you, sis!

Also, thanks to the runners, announcers and tech staff for another outstanding GDQ.  Happy gaming to all and to all a good night!
2nd year watching and 2nd year donating. Thanks to my girlfriend for introducing me to such a great and fun event. Great job on another great GDQ!
Long time watching, first time donating. Let's get that Mario 64 run! Also, greetings from Missouri, which is basically Germany, right?
Every time I see the donations stop coming in I get worried and think it's time for me to step up to the plate. Now I finally opened my wallet and chipped in.
No time to slow down now! Gotta go fast!
You know what? Though I THOUGHT 20 bucks would be my total for SGDQ 2016, we're still kinda far away from Mario 64. Here's another 35. Step it up, GDQ donators! PS: WAAAAAA! 
MOAR MONEY FOR THE SUPER JUMPS
cool stream
SGDQ hype! Respect to all of the runners that participated in this event, and good luck to Lack on the rest of SMRPG.
SMRPG! One of the best games ever made. Glad I can catch the last half after a late night at work. We made it past a million! Good Job everyone!
Didn't get a chance to watch SGDQ this year, but enjoying the chance SMRPG live!
When people tell me video games are a waste of time, I tell them the amazing folks that put together the GDQ Marathons would like to have a word with them. 

Proud to support the cause. Thank you all for your time and sharing your astounding talents.
I remember donating for as much Mario 64 as possible a couple years ago when Siglemic ran 120 star, if everyone watching on Twitch threw in another 5 bucks we would crush the GDQ record, lets do it!
I don't want SGDQ to end! D:
Always love watching GDQ events, have some cash for keeping me entertained all week.
Thank you SGDQ for the amazing week. Here is a freebie. Cheers.
100 super jumps? Sub two minute minecart? Mack skip? Decent freebie luck? Simply incredible run so far. Keep it up LackAttack! I'm re-running this awesome game casually on the Wii U and could only manage 44 jumps this time, so 44 is how much I'll donate. Fingers crossed for a sub 3 hour run and lets see some Mario 64 so I can stay up even later tonight!
For the runners: Are item freebies random?
Because every little bit counts. 
Would love to see the SM64 race. Let's beat last year's goal!
Super Mario RPG  was very defining of my childhood along with FF XI.  Both games I played for hours as a wee child, and both I was unable to finish until I returned to them later in college. Great showing from all runners.
Here's my donation to get in on some of those sweet prizes. And extra for the sub-1:57 cart run! And extra extra for the 100 super jumps! And-- I feel like I'm going to be doing this for the rest of the night.

This donation is also on behalf of my sweetheart, who could not join us this week because he is currently in military training. FT, I love you.

Thank you, SGDQ team and community, for making this week so magical. <3
Great job u guys for this year speedrun.
Ive given $80 so far over the week, I might as well make it an even $100 for this SGDQ! Great week of amazing runs. Thanks to all the runners, staff, couch crews, and even the chat. Really looking forward to the next event, but first, lets beat last years donation level! We can do it! 
Demon Chocobo is life!  Demon Chocobo is Love!  Demon Chocobo shall have revenge upon your souls, you filthy nonbelievers!

Seriously, can't I leave you all alone for 2 days to attend a funeral without the whole community degenerate into good sense??

[Donation staff,] Put this towards Demon Chocobo [because I can't directly].  I don't care that the run is already over; let the record show that Demon Chocobo ended the marathon at parity!
This is your curse.  This donation COULD have gone to SM64 if you all had kept the faith!
Belated Checkers donation
best game ever and such a fun speedrun. 
Cx
Get a freebie!
This is for my brother Chris who I never let him Mario RPG as a kid.  Love you man.  Let's have a Mario race when I get back to the states.
So glad to see how successful this GDQ has been in doing so much for such a good cause.  I'm happy to donate to support such a great charity and so many amazing people who made this all possible! Peace, love and good vibes to everyone! Can't wait to see what comes around for AGDQ in the winter!
If you wanna beat the heat, you gotta be leet
Just doing my part
Long time watcher, first time donor. Love watching the Super Mario RPG run as it is one of my all time favorite games. Awesome work by everyone to help and support this awesome cause! It's been a great event to watch!
It's been a great event for a great cause. I already can't wait for AGDQ2017!
one for each super jump
I don't have too much to give, but I'd love it if my donation was read. super amazing SGDQ so far, let's extend it with one more Super Mario 64 run.
Just finished cleaning up after work and came into the stream just in time for the 100 Super Jumps on Johnny, gosh dang! LackAttack really knows how to make the stream the most inviting. Congrats!
Bonk, Bonk, Bonk.  One dollar for each damage dealt.
Good stuff, keep it up. Waaaa!
Just a quick donation before the end of this lovely week of speedruns.
Thanks to all the runners crew and sponsors for making this an amazing Sgdq get hype and shatter last years record. 
10 CENTS PER SUPER JUMP
Had to donate during SMRPG, one of my favorite games of all time. I remember my dad used to play it every night back in 1996 when it first came out and my brother and I used to cheer him on. He read all the dialogue out loud for us. Slept over a friend's house the day he beat Culex, so I never got to see what happened afterwards till THIS YEAR when I dumped 15 Rock candies into him. Oh yeah and WAAAAAAAAAAHHH!
Good job!
ONE MORE GAME!  ONE MORE GAME!  ONE MORE GAME!
5 for the 100! 
Wish I could have take few days off work to see more...
Maybe next time. 
Hold on....can we go back and explain exactly how Mario taught Princess Peach the "Shocker"?!?!? Definitely the highlight of the week. Awesome job everyone and thanks for all you've done....
Hello everyone. This is Honmayan, kind of new watcher of AGDQ. Super Mario RPG is a masterpiece of a game, and seeing it being played brings so much wonderful memories from my childhood. Thanks for the awesome runs on all games, here's a little donation for a big cause. 
GG to all the runners this week. loved watching all the runs. Thank you for raising mad cash for such a wonderful cause
Go Lack! Thanks for welcoming us to the speed running community and teaching us some smb strats. Good luck on the rest of the run. 
Mario 64 Hype.
No comment.
Thanks for the awesome week!
Hey everybody. Its that happy sad part nearing the end of GDQ. Here's five for checkers last time and five for lack this time.  Lets hit that final incentive for one more game. Peace, Love and of course... Video games !!
Twin Cities were great. Thanks for a great week. 
Here's to Yaridovich getting Yaridowrecked
First time donating for this event and I get to see Mario's exxor face and peach's glitchy umbrella sprite.  This has been a great week for speedruns.  Keep up the good work.
I'm thankful I have a chance - and some extra cash - to send towards this charity. I'm super sad that missed the first few days of SGDQ because I was hospitalized, but I've spent all my life in and out of hospitals and the importance of good doctors who go above and beyond has been something I learned from an early age. I'll always do my best to show my appreciation for them, especially over a cause like this. 
Love the show! Entertainment  24hours a day fits my baby's sleeping patterns 
Super Mario RPG was the first real RPG I played, and one of my favorite games of all time. The runner and couch are great, with insightful commentary and excellent gameplay.  Thanks all the amazing charity work GDQ has done, and I hope we break the record.
I didn't get to watch as much this week as I wanted but what I did get to watch I loved. I want to support the runners, staff, and this great charity as much as I can. Thank you all for all your hard work and I hope to see you all again next year.
Been a fan of speedrunning for a few years, and finally getting a chance to donate and help you guys help the underprivileged get the medical help they need.  Greetings from Seoul on my last day in Korea before heading back home, thanks for inspiring me to start speedrunning myself.  Kill the animals with the quickness!
I have been waiting all week for this game, good luck Lack. Dylan, I know you're watching.
My donation didn't go through the first time :( 5 dollars plus 1 for each second under 2 minutes. SM64 hype!
Gunk
Here is my 5, I expect the rest of chat to match.
I think Caleb needs to flex for the CORE right now. Thank.  Bye.
Thank you so much for having at least one of the Mario RPG's this year! I may not have played this game YET, but I love the Paper Mario series, which is close enough. Let's destroy the animals like Nintendo destroyed Mario RPG's.
$10 for being awesome and running one of my favorite games. 

Hoping to see the Mario 64 run and run fast. 
HYPE!!!
Super Mario RPG came out right before my 11th birthday and I wanted it more than anything. My  parents couldn't afford the game and I accepted it sadly - but my grandfather secretly took me to the store to pick it up on his dime, even though he was poor too. It was such a generous thing and introduced me to one of my favorite games of all time, so this donation's in his memory. To Nintendo: Make a sequel! To Lack: You can get less than six minutes on the mine cart? Holy crap!
Loving the fact you guys do this for charity, this is my first SGDQ and I am very impressed. Keep it up guys!
Mario HYPE!
If everyone one watching the stream donates $5 we will make the goal. Let's gooooooooooo.
Is it too late to kill the animals? Kill the animals! Or reach an all new record for fundraising at SGDQ, whatever works for you.
You guys all rock, lived the maraton as always. $8 million hype!
Really enjoyed everything I saw in the marathon. Looking forward to AGDQ 2017!
Here's $5 for doing the mine cart sub 2, multiplied for every flower. 
Gdqs are my favorite events each year.  I never want them to end.  My daughter is only 4 months old and watchEd with me all week.   I keep thinking about how fun it will be to share these games and this event with her in the future.  Thank you all for your passion for gaming and giving. Let's break one more record and earn that Mario 64 run.


275 smackaroos from the audience as promised! Shoutouts to Pie for being an awesome promotion d00d.
...It's my birthday and I missed all the things! Oops! But hey, I'll donate some. I'd ask for it to go towards saving the animals, but I'm a bit late for that... I guess I'll find out what happens when I watch on youtube.
Come on, guys, we can break last year's record! Super Mario 64 HYPE! I mean, WEEEHHHHHHHHH.
Why?  Because Pie said so.
Nothing like the last minute!  Well done everyone and thanks for another great SGDQ!
Lets keep the HYPE train rolling!
WAAAAH!
Paying up. 
chowdahplz
Mario RPG was one of my favorite games growing up. I'm not able to watch the run live, but I had to donate during it.

SMRPG: for the item freebies, it's easy! Always have it always, never not have it.

This is for the best older game I can think of. SMRPG HYPE!

Thank you all for the marathon.
Greetings from Aersia! Congrats on yet another successful marathon! Wahoo!
I'm really proud to see so many people gather together and run such a great event for a great cause! I think many, including myself are very thankful for the entertainment and the wonderful effort this past week. I hope y'all know that and I want to wish everyone a happy summer! 
I've been looking forward to this Super Mario RPG run since before SGDQ was even a thing! Thank you for all that you guys do and see you next time! WAAAHHHHH
Hi SGDQ! Greetings from Canada.

I've been tuning into SGDQ all week and it's been such an inspiring event every single time I watch it. To see the passion and hard work that goes into these events is really something special. Here's to more charitable events, epic runs and dead animals. And to the runners... You guys got my PogChamp face on all week. Cheers.


1 dollar for each day here ya go =)
Power up audio here. Thanks again for an amazing week. Hopefully we'll see everyone again soon!

Super Wario MSF : Legend of the SM64 Race
Donating on behalf of ShackCon 2016 and the Shacknews community. Thanks for a hell of a ride and keep doing it for Shacknews and Doctors Without Borders!
Minecart HYPE!!!
The first time i played Super Mario RPG, i was around 7 years old. and i remembered i couldn't figure out the password for the Sunken Ship. I became desperate and i waited until my birthday so i can make a wish. Moments later i went back to the game and my big brother came through and spared my torment with a single word. "PEARLS" 

Love this game and love seeing this game getting completely destroyed for such an amazing cause.
Mine cart couch match, that's fun to say three times in a row.
This is my first year donating, second time this event! Super Mario RPG run by Checkers was my favorite run to play over and over in the background while I worked. Thank you for hosting an amazing event.
Glad to see the marathon ending on one of my favorite games.  Keep it up and Good Luck Lack!
Long time watcher, first time donator. Let's beat last year's record!
Had to during my favorite game of all time. I'm happy to be donating to such a good cause and huge shout outs to all the runners and staff that donate their time and energy to making this event happen.

Super Mario RPG HYYYYYYYYYYPE!
Here's my $10 from the cart before, you guys crashed donations for a little! Amazing what you guys do, thanks to every single person involved! Wub a lub a dub dub!
Donating to break last year's record!  Let's see some SM64.

First time donating, third time watching. Everyone involved deserves a round of applause. Shout out to Uncle Bones!
Super mario RPG was my favorite game as a kid so I had to donate, also - I want to see that 70 star run! Let's-a go!
Here's a combo donation of the sub 2 minecart session where I donate 1 dollar for each flower gained in Call Your Shots!

Now let's beat the record, everyone! HYPE!!
Super Mario RPG has a fun story and great music, but let's keep the party rolling with that Super Mario 64 race!
You better get that kiss.
12 flowers snagged and 12 cans of pepsi in a case... coincidence? I think not.
Here's another $12 for each fire flower 
$20 for the sub 2 minute mining and 12.00 for the wonderful flower collector you are.  Enjoying SGDQ!
Calling out twitch chat, if everyone gave  $1 we would fly right past that 1,215,000 and get some super mario 64 goodness. Here is $40 to cover some that may not be able to.
This has been a great week! It went by so fast, and i want to say thank you to everyone. This goes to the goal 1.2 mill! and as well as the sub 2 minute cart run. I cant wait already for ADGQ. Shoutouts to everyone who ran, my friends in this room here with me! What a EXCITING WEEK!! 
It's not much, but $2 for every flower on Booster Hill.  Almost time for Super Jumps! #TeamLack
Just chipped in for the minecart madness, but what the heck, here's one more for each flower collected!
My favorite SNES game of all time! 
A dollar for each flower
$25 for every flower over 10, keep it up~!
Sub 2 minute mine cart!
I've watched a lot of the runs on youtube but I've always missed the stream itself. It feels awesome to actually donate. 
GDQ won $12 from me...great job Lack
Best minecart run! Sub 1:57!!!
1.216 million HYPE!
My last donation goes in for one of my favorite RPGs of all time. Thanks again for this awesome event, all the great runs, and to all the great runners who practiced and made this event amazing!

(Super Mario RPG, @KiraDomination)
Making one last donation to recognize the Games Done Quick team.  It's been amazing seeing these events grow over the years, to the point where they're raising over a million dollars for great charities.  Thank you for volunteering all the time and energy that it takes to put together an amazing event like SGDQ 2016!
I'll donate my mine cart money from my seat in the audience cause I'm lazy Kappa
$12 for 12 flowers
I miss the olden days of 2013, when I had no living expenses and could give generously to GDQ. But. I mean, sub-2 Minecart. Take my $5.
First time watching. Never been prouder of the gaming community. 
10 for the sub 2 train, 1 more for each second under
Congrats on the sub 2 minutes Lack!
Thank you so much for providing so much joy and fellowship for my boyfriend Zac. It lights me up to see how excited he gets every AGDQ and SGDQ, and I know that it does the same for hundreds of thousands of other people. The happiness and hope that you share has no limit. Let's hit 1.2 million!
that mine cart minigame made speedy gonzales look like regular gonzales
For doctors without borders
To help towards the goal! thank you so much for sreaming such amazing games and hours of entertainment :=) -Sebbington <3
great job on the mine cart and the run in general! WAHHHHHH!
He did the mine cart in under 2 minutes. I knew he'd do it but yet I promised I'd donate if he did. I'll double the donation if the announcer can pronounce  my name correctly. Been a great trip all week watching all of you. I"ll definitely be contacting a few of the communities to join up. #SGDQ2016 #WALUIGI #DEMONCHOCOBO
Just got back from running around playing Pokemon Go and saw you guys were still going! I've never played SMRPG but it's my boyfriend's favorite game so I figured I'd check it out. Thank you guys for such an amazing stream!
Only been following GDQ for about a year and really impressed with how much you guys have accomplished. Great job and keep up the great work. 
Let's beat SGDQ 2015 guys!
Let's go lackattack! Love watching you crush this game 
Truely my favorite game of all time.  Bowser crying is the best animation in the game!!!! You guys are the best thanks for the great cause!!!!
That minigame was amazing. Could not go without donating.
Thanks for doing this awesome event each year! Super Mario RPG is one of my favorite games from my childhood. Now Nintendo, can we please bring Mallow and Geno back?! Please?
That minecart run, though! I've been watching a lot of GDQ all week, but it's about time to donate. What better way than on a gamble?
This is all I have because the super market I work part time at pays terribly, and video games cost a lot.

I'm not doing this for you, I'm doing it for my boy Pepsi Man.
for teh mine cart
Let's get that 70 star run.
My last donation for the marathon. Great job everyone. The event is better every time I watch. The Super Metroid race with Behemoth clutching it out to kill the animals was amazing. The delerious Bonesaw and his love of Owen Wilson and his car keys. Pepsiman was a treat, and TASbot is mindblowing. You all are so talented and fantastic. Never stop doing this, you brighten the world and change it for the better.

Thank you!
This has bee the bed GDQ to date! Let's finish with a bang- congrats to all the runners
5 dollar hype! Been awake for nearly two days so me and my boyfriend have to take a little power nap. Planning to wake up to the 70 stars run. Fingers crossed. 
Had to donate during the greatest SNES game ever!!!  This is my first donation and that sub 2 minute mine cart gave me no choice but to donate.  (Don't tell my fiance)  Awesome work guys!  Send this to announcers choice
LackAttack24 Mine Cart Hype!
I was iffy when it was presented, but watching it in action, I had to give credit where it's due for that stellar minecart action. Props for the great week of gaming and best of luck for the remainder of the marathon.
Been watching SGDQ all week and absolutely love SMRPG. Watching the Mack Skip two years ago blew my mind and started me on trying to speed run this game myself. I am happy to contribute to such an amazing cause and don't want this week to end!
If there was ever a time to donate it's now. Come on let's bet last years SGDQ total!
Fine. Take my $5. And then some.
Great SGDQ this year! 1.1 million plus!
Good job on the mine cart :D
For doing the mine cart run in under two minutes, I'll double the match amount.  Super Mario RPG is one of my husband's favorite games so it seems fitting for one of my donations this year to be during this run.  Thursday was our 9th anniversary so this donation is for him.  A donation to a great cause during a game my husband loves, a fitting way for us to close out SGDQ 2016. 
What an amazing experience to be a part of - very sad that it is ending after this. Great organization for a great cause!
In loving memory of our dad who loved Super Mario RPG. Best moment tonight was completely trashing the side scrolling minecart sections!
 I missed more of this than I'd care to admit but I can never resist donating. I love this cause and every GDQ, already want 2017 to start for the next one! Thanks for the grand spectacle again!
lack broke the website, this is my 4th attempt at donating lol 
Please take my money :(
For that sub 2 madness and 1.2 million H-Y-P-E... HYPE!
Minecart
GG WP ALL!
A promise is a promise and it's going to a good cause! Well done, Lackattack24! Keep up the good work guys! 
Ps: Where is the monitor senpai from AGDQ 2015!? I miss it!  Greetings from Finland!
I love gdq's,  thanks everyone who is awesome enough to be a part of this community
YOU'RE WINNER !

(From here, it looks like the donation tracker actually went down for a few minutes.)

Minecart HYPEEEE
Here's $10 for LackAttack's sub 2 minute mine cart run.  This week has been amazing, and I'm already excited for the next GDQ event!  Here's to reaching that last incentive!

Awsome marathon as always. Already can't wait for the next GDQ.
Congrats on finishing the mini game in 1:56! Put this towards the Geno and Mallow plushies!
SMRPG Hype! $5 for the sub 2 min mine cart!
This game's music is better than Taylor Swift.
For that clean mine cart run coming just over 3 seconds under 2 minutes.
Last donation of the event. Been a good week. And loving this ride or with Mario. Thank you again to all the staff, runners, volunteers, and grandma's that helped make this event another classic. Love to everyone out there. And as always, one last HYYYYYYPE!!!!
For the sub 2. Let's get that 70 star run!
I've followed a few GDQs before, but this is my first time donating. SMRPG  is my favorite game of all time and I'm always happy to see it run. A big thanks to all of those that make these events possible. you guys are awesome!
Glad to see my favorite game on stream to finish off the week.  Great job on the sub 2 minutes.
This is my McDonalds breakfast money. Instead of clogging my arteries it will be saving lives. Great runs to all this week!
Congratulations on a great SGDQ and I hope this first time donation helps us break last year's record! 
I am addicted to seeing that donation tally go up. And I was challenged to put down some cash for a sub-2 minute run. 
please put this 10 dollars towards DS Dad becoming my real dad

Here's my $5 for that sub 2. Let's shatter that donation goal and get that Mario 64 race!
Lets break that record people
Paying respect for that superb minecart run, and giving thanks for closing out this event with one of my favorite games of all time.  But I don't want it to end either, so here's hoping we break that  donation record!
The mine chart donations are still coming. It seems to be bogged down right now. 
Have patience! And I will honor my end if the bargain by making sure my $5 for the mine cart bet goes through too.
Every GDQ I am floored by the ability of the speedrunning community to create an event that does so much good for so many people. Thank you, thank you, thank you to all of the volunteers, runners, and everyone else who has made this SGDQ such a success. 
1:56 Kreygasm
I can't donate as much as I'd like, but I just HAVE to see that SM64 run!

Under 2 minutes hype! You said 5, but I think you deserve more for that wonderful event! Also, kill the animals wahhhh!
Gotta be a part of this wonderful event. 3rd year watching and I want that Super Mario 64 run. HYPE!
Great job on the mine cart. I expected more from you on the horn though.  

You guys are amazing, keep up the good work. 
This is my congratulations for the sub 2 minecart run! First time donating and watching live. SMRPG is one of my all time favorite games. Thank you everyone (runners and staff alike) for your hard work. Love you all.
WAEH (good mine cart run)

Now I dare everyone in chat to do the same! Let's break all donation records!
Someone tell Pie he needs to start running this game again.
I didn't make any promises, but here's my 5 bucks anyways! Shoutouts to ZEON!
Wasn't able to save the animals so lets try our hardest to save each other. great event, here is 10 for the sub 2 min. mine cart run.

Thank you GDQ staff, runners, and supporters of all sorts for holding such an amazing event.

P.S- Late Donation is Late.
Here is  my money for the sub 2 mini game. Well done Lackattack24! 
I have the cajones. As promised, 5 dollars to the best minecart section I've ever seen.
Time to pay up. Let's get to that Mario 64 hype!
Waaaaaaaaah
Sub-2 min cart run!
Good cart run. 
Samus, Link and Waluigi in a Mario game? Is this a Super Smash Brothers Speedrun? 
Sub 2 HYPE
Gotta dish out for that sub-2 minute hype. Mario RPG is so good, I figured why not just double up. Keep up the great work.
For helpful tips on how to grow your stream please visit streambig.net
Why isn't there an old man river incentive? C'mon Pie! 
Good luck on your run Lack. Love,your favorite Sandwich.
How can I not match? Awesome run so far - keep it up!
Well I've been watching SGDQ all week but I have yet to donate. The sub 2-minute minecart was just the excuse I needed. Awesome job Lack, and all the runners who have participated throughout the week, such a great cause!
$5?  How about $50!  Let's beat last year's total and get that Mario 64 run!
Hey Nate here, I haven't donated all GDQ because I've only been seeing the tail end of this run, but Couch called me out to donate on a sub 2 minutes, so here's my money

Put this towards... well Doctors Without Borders, cause I'm too late to put it towards anything else
Super Mario RPG was one of my favorite games growing up. So here's $1 for each second of the minecart run
Let's break this record WAAAA!
Let it never be said that I backed down from a challenge. This should cover me and three scrubs who did not have the courage to donate.
For the cart thingy I guess I implicitly agreed to? In any case, thanks again to everyone for an amazing week of keeping us all entertained!
Minecart ho! (Delayed by site issues)
Here's my money from the sub 2 minutes minecart. Good luck with the run, and let's get that SM64 race. HYPE!
Final run of SGDQ already??? Almost missed it. Keep up the good work everyone.
Take my $5, take my cojones
This is for completing the mine cart track in under 2 minutes. P.S. can I get change?
$5 for sub-2 minute, and an additional $5 more for each second under the goal. Well done!
For the Mario mine cart run.

Thanks for all the games this week everyone... Endless hours of entertainment.  Wish I had time free this week to see it live.  Hopefully next year.
I literally just played this game for the first time this past week to prep for this finale... here's my $5 for destroying the minecart minigame that I was terrible at!
a guy on the couch in a video on the internet told me to donate 5 dollars because a guy playing a game did the thing.

How could I refuse?
$15 for every second faster than 2 min on the mine cart on mario rpg. Good last run and great sgdq!
Donating 50 plus an extra 5 for the sub 1:57 in one of my  favorite childhood games. WAH!
Great mine cart ride!
Last donation for this year. It's been a great week! Thanks to all the runners, hosts, tech, the crowd and all the hidden heroes! 

Eagerly waiting for AGDQ 2017!

Jens
OHHHHH, that minecart run! A deal's a deal, here's my 5 for your 2.
Hope people get the help they need from Doctors without Borders!
sub two minute mine car by lack!!
gg SMRPG
Here is my $10 for everyone  on the couch after that sub 2 minute cart ride. That's what we agreed to right?
Here's my relatively small donation, though I am adding $5 for the sub 2 minute minecart sequence!
Putting my money where my mouth is
Take mine money!
please let me donate
I have been watching all week with my girlfriend and we have to get in one last donation. I cannot be any more hyped for a SM64 race. Lets beat last years total!
Sub 2 mins, pay up chat
Sub-2:00 mine cart plus $1 for every second under
Pretty much the game that set the standard for my RPG gaming. Also, a small fact that even the speed runners may not know! 

There is a spell attack you can defend against. Dark Star, used only by the secret boss, only issue is every time you defend the Dark Star jumps again, and again, and again etc. Not a very fast thing at all.
I've been watching all week and finally decided to donate after that great minecart run.  It's been an awesome GDQ and I can't wait to tune in again next time
Mine cart sub 2:00. 
SUB 2 MINE CART!!!
Love this fundraiser. Ty to runners, donators, twitchTV lurkers, broke people, rich people, audience members. Peace, love, and  long live the game!
I'll match the couch with 10, and raise them another 10! SGDQ helped me through a pretty bad week, and for that I'm extremely grateful. Can't wait to go back and watch everything I missed because of that pesky job. Let's see that SM64 run! Hype! 
Here is my $5 for the sub 2:00 minecart run
$5 for the sub 2 min mine cart.
Thanks for a fun and informative bunch of runs to distract me all week! Great to have Lack and his fun crew bringing it home with one of my all-time favorites. Here's a bonus tenner for that sub-2 minecart run.
My brother and I took the mine cart bet. Good job Lack!
MINECART SKILLS TO STROOONG.
Super Mario RPG is one of my favourite games, just like GDQ is one of my favourite events! Keep running in the fast lane guys!
First donation! This event as given me inspiration! Do you think Speedrunning this game and FF9 is a good idea audience? Cheer or boo! 
Time to pay up for that sub 2 minecart pieSellOut
Haven't been able to watch much but really enjoyed all the runs I caught, here's five dollars for sub 2
sub 2 minecart minigame = 5 dollar donation, seems fair to me
Here's five dollars for every second under two minutes on the cart-game. It's now past six in the morning here in Norway, but the end to the Metroid-race had me so excited I won't be sleeping until after the 70-star Mario 64 WHICH WE WILL REACH, LET'S GO PEOPLE.
The tracker broke from that cart run! Here's my $5, and $5 for the next one too!
1:56!
Meow you're truly ready to rumble~
Hi hi everybody! I'm 7 and my little sister is 5. We have been watching All Week. Me and my little sister put our allowances together cause we want the doctor gamers to help make as many people feel better as possible! Games are cool, and speedrunners are the best! Thank you everybody :) Love you!
WAAAAAAAAAAAAHH
5 for the mine cart sub 2 minutes and 45 for everything else thats happened so far. 
oh, and WAAAH
Good job on the minecarts.
Nice we crashed the donation server for a few minutes, keep the money train rolling!
Thank you for everything this week, it's been a pleasure. This thanks goes to everyone who help set up sgdq, everyone who donated, everyone who ran, and everyone who watched.
Here is my 5 and a bit of change
You know what you did.
This is my first time watching SGDQ live and I had to donate after seeing the mine cart run. As a kid I would go as slowly as possible so it would be easier to break my record later... but I would always forget to go back to Moleville to actually do it normally. Seeing you absolutely rock that was amazing, and my childhood self was cheering the whole time. 
Thank you so much for the work you do for Doctors Without Borders! Here's to making this a world where more wishes can come true!
Time to pay up. good luck on the rest of the run!
didnt have $5 to donate so heres 50 (^-^)
Truly the finest in mario minecartery I have seen in at least six, perhaps seven years!
Super Mario 64 HYPE!!
For that sub 2 minute minecart, peer pressure HYPE
A promise is a promise
This was for the minecart mini game, but it's late because I think a server blew up somewhere from the sheer amount of donations when I was trying to donate.
Pokemon Go is love, Pokemon Go is life
Better get that money, guys!
an extra dollar for every second below 2 min.
Wait! Make add $10 for the mine cart sub 2 minute run!
This is for breaking 2 min on the mine cart. Also let's hope we can make the incentive for Mario 64 race.
Well I've been meaning to donate to SGDQ 2016 for Drs. without boarders, and sub 2 minute mine cart seems as good a reason as any.
Five dollars for a sub 2 minecart... I WANTED that five dollars! I said I would stop donating yesterday... FUNGAH! FOILED AGAIN!
1'56" sub 2:00 HYPE!
$5.00 for the sub 2 minutes plus $2 for every second under  the 2 minute mark. Lets get that SM64 run and keep the marathon going. 
Matching and doubling.  Been watching since AGDQ 2013 and have been into watching speedruns ever since. Good luck Lack and here's to breaking the record.
That minecart segment gave me flashbacks to Donkey Kong Country madness. Sub 2-minutes? That's crazy! Fantastic run! Here's to seeing Mario 64!
NICE JOB ON THE MINECARTS! Here is my five, and five for four more chatters who couldnt afford it!
Pie convinced me to put it ALL ON THE LINE. Sub 2 mine cart hype!
Awesome sub 2 mine cart!
Here's my $5, grats to Lackattack24 on the 1:56!
We better get that SM64 Race.
Thanks for the Frames (or lack thereof) GDQ organizers. Always a blast to watch. 
Greatest. Game.Ever. Thanks to everyone involved, for putting on such a great event!
Four seconds under 2:00, that's 4 times the donation. 70 star hyyyyyyyyyype!!!!!!!!
Reth Eldirood here! (Pronunciation guide: Sounds like Ref Elder Wood)  I've been watching since AGDQ 2013 and every event I am awed.  Didn't get to watch as much as possible this time because of work.  But here for the Finale and hoping for more!  I would say 'Save the Animals' but that's old hat at this point, so... I dunno.  Super Mario RPG for best FF game?  Maybe a bonus stream run of Die Hard?  More single claps? Throw us a bone here!

Great job everyone and no matter what happens you all have made  a difference.  Keep it up, and as always, good gaming!
Amazing sub 2 minecart mini-game. Good luck on the rest of the run. WAHHHHHHHHHH
Sub-2! I didn't know that could be done! Also, first time donating, though I've caught many GDQ marathons. Great job on breaking $1million again!
That time was ridiculous, so I have to send in my 5 bucks for that. This is what Games Done Quick is all about.
I WANT THAT SM64 RUN!!!!

Mario RPG was my favorite game for SNES.  I had to have beaten it 50 times.  Never this fast.  Super Mario RPG HYPE! Mario 64 HYPE!
$5, plus $4 for each second below 2 minutes, plus $1 because OCD.
Not only do I have the balls to donate $5 for a sub two, here's an additional five for the other three people watching the stream with me.  Thanks for another amazing stream and all that you do.  Already looking forward to AGDQ next year.
Tarrrrr Nation! What a Hootin and Hollerin sub 2 minute cart ride! Mario, you ARE a legend!
I'm glad Lack had the STEAM to stay on TRACK on that cart bit

Paying up for the sub 2 minecart
THE GAUNTLET HAS BEEN THROWN, THE CHALLENGE MADE.  I will accept it.
For that sub 2 min. mine cart! Go Lack!
I usually never have anything to do when I get off work at 2AM, but  I have had a great week watching these talented, funny, and entertaining runners. Thank you runners, and thank you GDQ for the work you do putting this together. And it's all for a good cause! I love you all.
Great SGDQ. Thanks to all the runners, couch crews, announcers and audience members for keeping the hype real!

Congrats to the sub 2 minutes, LackAttack!  Major shoutouts to Raysfire and everyone in his community, the SMRPG speedrunners, Pok3monrocks and everyone who has helped donate to this amazing cause.  Let's show how video games are truly an amazing contribution to the world and break the 1.2 million wall!
For the sake of putting it all on the line for a marathon run, here's a little extra. Mad props to LackAttack for the sub 2. Now, how much for Caleb to lose the shirt?
Sub 2min minecart!? Holy cow, Lack.

I almost spent this $5 on Pok√©mon Go microtransactions earlier today. 

IT'S TOO TEMPTING

TAKE THIS MONEY AWAY FROM ME BEFORE I USE IT FOR EVIL MICROTRANSACTIONS
PogChamp

He got sub two, but I haven't donated yet so here's a little extra.
Amazing SGDQ! I tossed up my $5 plus more for that wicked Mine Cart run! 
Was gonna donate $10 for the minecart, then decided I was gonna match and then add $15 to make my total $50 for this marathon. Thanks for the marathons every year and the countless hours of entertainment. Good luck on the rest of your run, Lack. :D Maybe next year I'll be able to come out and see it all go down in person. 
WAHHHHHH!
Sub 2:00 HYPE!!!

Honoring the bet. The rest of Twitch Chat should to. PAY UP GUYS
Great speedruns. 1st time donating
I know the initial deal was $5, but since Lack got a new PB a figured I may as well toss in a $15 bonus.
I put it all on the line, and Lack did it. I guess THIS IS IT! #teamlack
I'm a man of my word, Lack! Congrats on the minecart minigame, and to all of the GDQ runners and staff for making this all possible! It may only be $5, but every dollar counts with regards to such a world-shaping cause.

I grew up fighting over the controller with my brothers, so I'm happy to see runners introducing more families to this fantastic game that is sure to destroy their relationships. 
I happened upon GDQ in my twitch stream earlier this week, had no idea it existed. Now its been on every minute I've been home all week. Loving the spectrum of games and its for a great cause.

Here's a 5.00$ for that awesome minecart run by lack attack plus a few extra for my favorite game of all time SMRPG. I play this game at least once a year as a ritual and to see it ran as a finale is definitely something to donate for. Here's to stomping cancer like a goomba!

Huge thanks to all of you for this wonderful week and especially props for everyone working behind the scenes!
Awesome mine cart ride.  Lets get another challenge for Booster Hill flowers
Hey, Lack, since you're here, maybe you could clear up something for me. My bride-to-be is chanting, "MARIOHELPMEMARIOHELPME". Is she showing her happiness? 
Five bucks for sub two mine cart.  Fifteen more because I'm sure at least three of you didn't.
All right, you deserve it for that minecart
This is for Lack getting sub 2 minutes on the minecart. Shoutout to NeoGAF. I'm a man of my word.
mario kart
Had to get in on that minecart action. Well done, Lack! Fellow watchers, keep it coming in -  we're so close to breaking that marathon PB!
$5 for a sub-2 minute mine cart didn't seem like enough. How about $1 for each second in the final time!
Second year watching, first time donating! What a great event, thank you for putting it on every year!
Little extra for the 1:56! Awesome event all around and wish you the best of luck for the rest of your run, Lack!
me and my buddies owning up to the sub 2 min on the carts
Hey all, thank you so much for everything you do. From the staff, to the runners, to the commentators, and even the awesome audience. There has been a lot of negativity in the news and it is great to see so much POSITIVITY and goodness come together for some great causes. Oh yeah and SUB 2 HYYYYYYPE!
$5 for the sub-2, another $5 for making the 1:56!

Keep on rocking!

1.3 million HYYYYYYPE!!!
Good job Lack here's the $5 for the mine.  Plus another $5 because I love GDQ!!

SUB 2 HYPE
$5 per second under 2 minutes. Go go gadget lackattack.
Thank you for all that you do. I'm a nursing student working on lots of homework for summer school, but I stopped to donate for that fantastic mine cart time. I am not a speed runner, but I watch you guys religiously every 6 months. You all work so hard at what you do and it inspires me to work harder to be the best nurse I can be. I love you guys and hope to be there in person after I graduate this year.
I'm not sure if I'm supposed to subscribe to a channel, or whatever, but for that cart run I'm finally donating.

Also, WAAAAAHHHHHH
Sub2!  In the middle of an aram though

Watching the GDQs with my partner has become a sort of holiday I look forward to every time it comes around, and I hope it remains a part of our lives for years to come. If everyone could share in the spirit on display in these incredible events the world would be a better, happier place.
The look on my dumb husband's face at the sub two mine cart finish was so worth five bucks!
congrats on reaching 1 MILLION dollars in donations! Looking forward to watch all the reruns on YouTube. 
Great Minecart run!

Hey everyone, enjoying the stream so far. I wish I watched more. Anyway, keep doing what you are doing and keep being awesome! :)

Nicely done with a sub-2 mine cart. I've watched enough of Lack's Zelda runs that I knew it was all but done before he started. Here's $10 - let's get that SM64 race! Go #TeamLack!
Five dollars? How about five for every second sub-two-minutes? Took me months of practicing those mine carts as a kid to get those times. Keep wrecking seven-year-old me, Lack.
Here's 20 for the sub 2 time! Hope I can stay up and see if we hit the 70-star race!
good job on the mine cart mini game, my quick little pepper!! keep it up -- SMRPG is what got me into RPGS when I was 9!
Long time fan of GDQs, matching for those who can't, and on another note i think i'll apply for AGDQ 2017 with my 8h any% pb on SMRPG, Lack's got nothing on me! Good job to everyone involved in this fabulous event!
