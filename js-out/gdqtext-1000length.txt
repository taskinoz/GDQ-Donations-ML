Was going to donate, but forgot to do so during the event. Better late than never I guess!
Been watching for the past few years. Keep up the awesome work. More zelda the better 
This is fun and good to do.
Here hold 5 buck 
Good work
I can't bear to leave the donation total at such an uneven, ugly number. Ideally I'd like to have it at $1,300,000.00, but this will have to do. I love everyone involved with SGDQ, can't wait for AGDQ 2017!
Nevermind, I can't math. Here's another $5. Not that anyone will read this.
Is this still up? Here's another $5. Puts us over $1.3 mil.
Hey bros good luck on the runs,  kill the animals,  and... ok wait can I just say, like, real talk im gettin tired of reading all these donations. my voice hurts. i get NO RESPECT and im just done *get up and walk out donation person*
Glad to see some friends on the main stage this year. Props to all the great people in the community who make this wonderful event possible.
Caught my first GDQ last summer and instantly fell in love with it! First time donating, and certainly not my last! 
Well done all!
Loved the event! Can't wait till AGDQ in January. Good luck to MSF!
Thanks for a great event
It's been a fantastic show so far, keep it up everyone!
Work made it hard to watch the runners as much as I was able to last year. But I got to catch some of LackAttack's SMRPG. Lots of fun for an amazing cause. Best wishes, and always SAVE THE ANIMALS.
I'ma go practice Banjo Kazooie runs.
greate job, thanks to all the runners, organizers and ofcourse the doctors 
PEPSI-MAAAANNNNNN

Thank you for very awesome event for great cause. It's always a treat to watch games being destroyed in order to go fast. I hope everyone have been great week, i know my sleep cycle is upside down.  Community around speedrunners are amazing. It's cheerful to hear everybody reacting in such way if something happens in a run. Let's have a huge clapping to the runners, audience and the crew behind managing the event. 
Humble Bundle!
Always great to see a Mario 64 race. Thanks for the awesome event everyone! Greetings from germany.

We've been watching Games Done Quick for years now, and this is our first time donating. We know it's not much, but hopefully we can contribute more in the years to come. We also however think there's too much Mario going on right now, and we wanted to request for the crowd to let out one more cry for Waluigi before SGDQ comes to a close! "WAAAAAAAAHHHH!"
This is my third year watching SGDQ. I cannot express how important and wonderful this week --- this whole event has been to me. Yet, Doctors Without Boarders is so much more important to so many others in need around the world. Runners, you are our heroes.

Never forget that.

Also, WAAAAAAAAAAA
If you can't handle me at my diddliest, you dont deserve me at my doodliest. 
Thanks for a cool GDQ!
Ive got a whole bar here in downtown Austin, TX checking out the last run of the week. Good job to all tje runners this week. Ive got a group of us here willing to donate a dollarfor every pushup Binny can do after the run. Good luck! 
Never too late for small donation. The fianc√©e is mad at how you can gather 70 stars  so quickly while it took months for her to do so. Love what you guys do. Thanks for another amazing SGDQ. HYPE!
We're all rooting for Biinny here in the front row. Biinny and his perfect haircut. Stop letting puncay win dude!
Greetings from germanguy101. Long time watcher second ti... welll you get my drift.
Happy to donate to such a great cause.
I wish everybody a great summer, and hope both organizers and the runners give eachother a large pat on the back.
Oh yeah - also the crazy twitch chat.
Good job guys.
Squeezing in a donation before the end! Thanks for a ton of entertainment and all the hard work from everyone involved!
Here's to this last race, good job guys. Going the distance and not sleeping to finish this last race.
Just wanted to get my first donation for a GDQ before the event was over. Love what you guys do and am already excited for the next AGDQ! Donation goes to winners choice!
I made it in time! Amazing cause, amazing runners, amazing SGDQ!
Wanted to donate before it ended. Cheers for the awesome event. 
All I want to say is thank you to everyone who made this awesome event possible.
I just want to see the total say 1234567 for a second. Thanks to all of you for being so awesome. It's so good to see this many people come together and raise so much for MSF.
Shut up and take my last-minute donation. :)
Greetings from Germany
congratulations on the money, here's some more
Go Biinny!

Congrats everyone at SGDQ.  Another great event!
HELLO EVERONE!!!
So stoked that all four of you nailed early ellies!!! Good job, fam. Here's the extra 40, as promised!
Unlikely a small donation will get read this late in the marathon but in case it does I wanna say thanks so much to everyone; the runners, the organizers, the announcers, the tech team, everyone who helps put this amazing event together. I've been watching for 3 or 4 years now and it's truly inspiring to see. I look forward to these every year.
Well done to everyone involved in this incredible cause. The amount raised has defied all expectations. It is so great to see this simply amazing Super Mario 64 race, congratulations to all! WhAAAAAAAAAA!!
Give me your best Waluigi "WAAAAAAAAH"

Also Twitch Chat spam Klappa for this amazing race.  Fantastic way to close out SGDQ 2016
So glad that I get off of night shift early and have a chance to catch the SM64 run. Good luck to the rest of the runners. Game on! 
GDQ restores my faith in humanity. Much love to the staff, runners, viewers, supporters and the doctors. Love will always win.
EZ Follow YouTubeBrock, I'm the best
Im glad i got the chance  to see this year's  sgdq and agdq and because of that i will  do my usual  5.00 donation  to help thanks for this year's  sgdq and save the animals 
To this day, my cousin is still convinced that Mario says "Let's pickle" when entering stages.

This is my last donation of the marathon, thanks to all the runners, support staff, and donators. You all deserve a huge round of applause for all the good you've brought to this world.
My girlfriend and I are loving this race. Super Mario 64 made me want to become a professional game designer. Thanks to all the runners for blowing our minds on a Saturday night. 
I have been addicted to the stream all week. You guys did a great job for a great cause. Now take this fifty dollars to save the animals
Go, Biinny! Go Biinny! GO!   cheekyMIPS
Don't have much to give, but Mario 64 was a huge part of my childhood. It felt wrong not to give after seeing this race in action. Thank you all <3
Enjoying the race guys learning a lot of stuff i didn't know about mario 64 ggs, also stop making me stay up so late lol
This event has been awesome, I'm so glad I was able to catch it live this year.
You guys are awesome. I love watching runners that put all their effort in improving their times. If I had enough time I would try to pick up a game to run myself :) 
god speed you.
You've shown that playing video games is an act of love...so many nostalgic titles being done quick, while raising money for a great cause. Thank you!
CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG CLANG

I'm sad to see the event come to a close, but just so hype for going above and beyond last year's goal! Until winter comes, let's keep the gaming going and the speed running alive! Bless you all for your hard work and dedication, and see you in several months!
My name is A Joy. I've watched every day this week. I love games. Please announce me.
The hype for this race is so real that I had to donate again. Also Over Million Dollars HYPE
is mario the one with the mustache? 
First time watching SDGQ live, this run has been great and congratulations to all the runners and staff! It really makes military life more manageable as this was something to look forward to, and I definitely look forward to future runs.
Congratulations on breaking one million!  Can't wait until the next speed running event. This week has been a blast. Thanks for providing a way for gamers to come together and do something good for others!
Thank you!
Thanks MV and all the french restream team!

To all of the people at GDQ: Thanks for yet another great event and thank you for all the laughs and surprises you have provided for me. Here's to many more GDQs down the line and Super Mario 64 HYPE!  
I love Games Done Quick

Let's finish this with a blast

Also shoutouts to SimpleFlips
JUST IN TIME I HOPE
Puncay, Cheese, and Simply first got me into speedruns and I've never looked back. I'm always so excited for GDQ events and this year was no exception. Thanks to everyone for making this one so great. Now let's get some HYPE for this race.
Tell Simply I love him and Duluth loves him from Elliot
Already given several times this week, but what the heck, one more won't kill me. Good luck to all the racers!
Thanks for the amazing GDQ, keep up the good work!
This is sadly all I have right now, but I'd be sad not to donate more, especially for Mario 64
I am one of puncays subs!
Hey Puncay its me the wet wipe wizard here to give you god RNG for your sick URN!
I was looking forward to this GDQ the most since I've started watching GDQ's, but unfortunately I missed it all because sometimes life happens. I'm just glad I'm here to witness the end, and here's to many more. One love. 
I'd like to give a shout out to Support Class for their amazing on screen graphics the last few GDQs! Hope I'll be able to attend a GDQ next year!
Thanks for giving us nocturnal people something to do over the week. Im so happy to finally witness GDQ live. Here is to many more.
For the first time ever, I'm finally able to  donate after all these years of watching.  Thank you to all the staff that puts in all the hard work, and to everyone who has made it possible to break records for just playing a bunch of games.  Had to donate during my favorite speed run game, Mario64.  LETS GO PUNCAY!
I'm always so nervous about writing a comment. No amount of good words can justly highlight the good coursing through the life blood of these events. What a good predicament to be in. This world is made of love and peace!
DS DAD! You are wearing a wonderful green shirt today. We are so glad to see you here again and we, Twitch chat, would like it if you waved to the camera for us!
Love Games done quick! HYPE!
Wowza, my first time watching and I am blown away at this community coming together for such a great cause! Dobje mum, dobje chesch.  Much love!
My first live gdq thanks to all <3 
Thanks for cheering me up from a bad week. Speed runners were amazing and big shoutout to the SGDQ Staff for all there hard work and dedication!
I forgive you Mario. I watched SGDQ this week and I'm feeling the love!
I barely caught SGDQ this year because my big boy job has me working all week, but I would be remiss if I didn't donate. Not sure if the animals lived or were killed but oh well, super Mario RPG was fun to catch. Until next year!
I've made a lot of silly comments and jokes over the last week, but in my heart I love all of you. You guys are amazing, the staff, the runners, and the audience! Stay true to yourself!
Last minute donation. What an amazing event this year. Thanks and congrats to all the runners for their hard work.
I don't have a lot right now, but I'm happy to help with what I can. the GDQs are amazing and support amazing causes, thank you for hosting such an amazing event and bringing such an awesome community together.
I love you guys and what you do! Mario 64 race hype!!!
Greetings from Sweden!

I'm not able to donate much but I want to contribute to this great cause and help as much as i can. Thank you everyone for everything you do! 
First time donater, couple year watcher. Introduced to this awesome event by me ex, but definitely a positive memory that I haven't missed an AGDQ/SGDQ event since. Shout out to Sam Eustace from B.C, Canada.

This donation goes to Puncay's wet wipe fund and an all-around great event. Thanks to everyone that made this possible!
I want Mariooooooo!
Checked how much I've donated so far, and thought I'd make it a round 100. Awesome event, and I'm so hyped for the 64 run!
chesHeart
Super Mario RPG and Mario 64 back to back. Perfect way to end my Birthday. Keep up the great work.
I truly wish I could finish off by giving more, but this is all I can spare after all my other donations. Thanks for everyones time and effort to make these past few days amazing! Keep it up, can't wait for the next GDQ! 
I didn't need to sleep anyway, first time donating and I'm glad its going to a good cause
(Please read during Mario 64 intro, Island Hop is the first star!)

I've decided to donate extra this year based on how swag the Mario 64 goes. Runners, for each of you that even attempts Island Hop, I will donate an extra $10 each. I will also donate an additional $10 for each Lava Boost Early Ellies in Bowser in the Fire Sea. Good luck guys! It's been a blast hanging with you all week!
Loved watching all speed runs this week. This is a great marathon and even better that it goes to charity.  A big thank you to all the speed runners and their dedication. 
Glad I managed to catch GDQ again. I enjoyed it last time and am enjoying now.
PS. When I was a kid, I always dropped all the baby penguins off the edge in the snow level in Super Mario 64. 
Good luck to everyone!
Ty for playing one of my favorite games smrpg.
Hey guys, i've been watching all week and it's made my week off work amazing. I'd like to thank the staff, runners and everyone else for making this event worth watching. Unfortunately i'm needed back at work so i'll miss the finale. See you next GDQ. WAAAAAAHHHHH!
Been watching since 2014, always love the Super Mertroid 4 way speed runs, among others. Keep the good work, and HYPE for bonus streams comeback!

Thank you for doing this.
Rock on for donating your time and talent to raise money for Doctors Without Borders!


It was super awesome to see SMRPG ran with such precision.  I can't wait for our encore race of SM64.  Thank you Runners and Crew!  And I am happy to donate to such a worthy cause.  I hope to make it to both events next year.  This had made me get into running and I hope to join you all on the couch or in the hot seat!
We especially woke up to see the end of this awesome event, thank you for helping those awesome people from Doctors without borders <3
Last of the marathon, great runs this year and can't wait for AGDQ!
Let¬¥s go Finland. Meet you at the market!
Does it have to end? No it doesn't! Time to find the car keys, Drink Pepsi, and Speed Run myself.
Go go Mario!
Rock on! It's been another amazing week of speedruns and donations, let's close it out on a high note!
Can't stop, Won't Stop!
Money's tight this year, but I wanted to get something in. I'm so proud of everyone for coming together to for charity. As a soldier, I can tell you that NGOs like this are crucial for bringing aid and relief to disaster areas and war zones in ways that militaries just can't.

Shout-out to the announcer for doing a great job. Let's get these last donations in for Doctors Without Collision Detection!
Thank you for the wonderful week, of wonderful people doing wonderful things! This is the best I can comfortably donate, but someday I hope to give so much more!
Good cause, and good event!
<3
It's a drop in the bucket at this point, but currently it's all I can afford to give.

I genuinely think this was the best GDQ event yet and want to express my thanks.
Hi everyone first off chat needs to give themselves of clappas, and I wanted to say that it my first time attending the event and I definitely want to attend next year.
It's been a very emotional experience watching SGDQ this year and enjoying it with everyone else! Hoping this last run will be an thrill for everyone. Thank you all!

Thank you AGDQ for making being sick at home less sucky.

Congratulation on making the goal
That piano that you can't see, it used to scare me as a kid
Gotta get a last minute donation in! SGDQ was great and it always brings a slight tear to my eye when these events are over. Thanks to everyone who donated and to all the streamers, commentators and volunteers who make these events happen. Thank you everyone.
GDQ is such a great community, and everyone that helped make it happen or donated should feel great about themselves. Especially you if you're listening Lange; see you on stream for TotH soon you big softy.
Been watching GDQ events for years now and I've gotta wonder; am I the only one who gets teary eyed at the end of them? BibleThump
Well, have to give a last donation for a great event.
Go player 3 for the race, not sure why but player 3 always win.
Congratulations SGDQ, everyone there and watching is amazing.  SMRPG if the best video game of all time. Thank you for everything and keep changing the world with your amazing runs and kindness!
Keep upp the good work. 
This is a great event. This is a worthy charity. Thanks for all you do.
Had to donate for a great game!
Long-time watcher, first-time attending. Thanks to all of the staff and runners for a fantastic GDQ.
SGDQ and AGDQ are some of the few events I look forward the entire year (better than xmas yo!). 

I hope this donation helps with setting a new WR for donations. 

Keep being awesome!
Sending $20 from Sweden, first time for me following this event and I will definitely tune in next time as well!

Please don't sign off SGDQ BibleThump BibleThump BibleThump
Awesome SGDQ this year; let's reach that goal!
Great event, and even though there is still a little left to go, I can say it was one of the best ones yet.  Watched as much as I could all week, and from the great runners to the excellent production value, there was always something to put a smile on mine, and everyone else's face.   Thanks so much for putting this on, and looking forward to all the new runners inspired from this week.  Speed on!
Hey!! You are awesome and its such a great cause! Thank you from germany
Love #GDQ, thank you from a viewer who loves what you do, AND how often the players invite people to join them in speed running. I love that welcoming attitude and it's one of the reasons I've been watching for a few years now!
CUP!
Great event! Specially loved the SMRPG run. 
I only started watching these marathons a year ago but now I'm hooked and can't stop watching them. Thanks for all the amazing runs.
Greetings from down under,  Super Mario 64 is my favourite game, and i always love to see people perfecting it. GDQ's are always fun to watch and a great way to raise money. Good luck with the run.
One more to make it 150 even. HYYYYYYPE!!!!
TEAM MYSTIC!!!
SGDQ, what is good in life? To crush your previous year's funding goals, see mario64 played before you, and hear the songs of your speed runners.
Last minute donation for you guys being awesome. Party on and keep making a difference.
I have never donated but this is my 3rd time watching the marathon.  Thanks to all the entertainment this week. I had a rough week of work, but knowing I could come home and watch the marathon helped.
For Old Man River
Long time watcher, first time donating -- What a fantastic event, props to every runner this week, my wife Lisa and my girls, Gwen and Roxy, had a blast watching this week, and can't wait for the next GDQ. You guys do so much good for charity, it's amazing.
Great GDK this year.  Always glad to stave off work to watch this every six months.
Woooo! Last minute! 5 bucks for all the games! 5 bucks for everything and all!
Love the amount of dedication and time you guys put in.  Here's to helping an awesome cause!
<3
It's been amazing watching all the cool runs! And such a great evening to conclude on with Mario RPG. Glad to see SM64 70 star race made it. Good luck & thanks to all the runners for a great show!
Just reminding that we are only 5k away from a 8 million total over GDQ events! Come on, we can do this!
Great work! Now, SMRPG low level run hype?
Shave the animals.
Hey guys!

I've been watching the GDQ events for around 3 years now and thought it was about time for me to donate, even if just a little bit.

Greetings from Brazil.
Thank  you all for providing a place for us to donate.  The fact that this goes to a good cause is why I am happy to send money.  You all are what we gamers should aspire to be.

Thank You
Thanks everyone. You're all amazing!
Loved watching these streams but only now am I able to lend a hand to the cause. Well done to everyone!
Just putting in some last minute cash! I haven't gotten to donate yet so I'm fixing that!
Sm64 all day baby. WAHHHHHHH
First time watching SGDQ live. Can say i was not dissapointed. Wish I had donated earlier, but better late than never.
Because you didn't get enough feebies, I decided to give 5 dollars to each feebies in the run. Here you do!
Congrats to Lack Attack for a successful SMRPG run
Great run! Hype to see Super Mario 64 after this and of course hear pie sing Old Man River.
Loved watching the runs this year so decided to donate, this year's SGDQ was great!
Great Speedruns and a great cause! Always a pleasure to tune into the Games Done Quick community and experiencing these great speedruns through a great community!
Thank you for SGDQ for a wonderful marathon to bring my whole family together for an interest in gaming.  Quick shout out to all of them: Raine, Leighton, Savannah, and Torin.  Woot-Woot SGDQ!!  Can't wait for the next one.
This game is the best of Weeeeeeeh. I still remember renting a N64 and taping our gameplay to watch it inthe days after. Here's some money towards the 64 run. GO MEMORIES. (weeeh)
Here's to passing last year's total!
*one up sound*
Just reminding Lack how much damage he's supposed to do with super jumps.  This is for the D!!!
Been watching for a few years, first time donating. Great cause, great event! Thanks to all the runners and everyone who helped make it great!
Donating to bump that final donation count up a bit! This year was my first GDQ I attended in person and I look forward to many more. Good luck Lackattack!
Sick super jumps!!
First time donating to this keep up the great work 
I love you SGDQ
1.22 million HYPE! Amazing job on this run, lack! So much fun to watch with all the new strats since Checkers' run in 2015. WAAAAAAH
Just finished my work week not too long ago and wasn't able to watch the marathon all week like I used to. But coming home to see what the speedrun community can do for others puts a huge smile on my face. Thanks to everyone who contributed in anyway during SGDQ! <3 FrankerZ
Long time watcher, first time donating -- What a fantastic event, props to every runner this week, my wife Lisa and my girls, Gwen and Roxy, had a blast watching this week, and can't wait for the next GDQ. You guys do so much good for charity, it's amazing.
So glad to be up watching the end of SGDQ. Hooray for beating last year, and hooray for more Mario!
[[ IIIII FEEEEEEL....HAPPY? ]]

You cannot comprehend the true form  of this donation.
I should go to bed, but the jumps keep drawing me in.
come on put mallow in.
Hey everyone, great job on surpassing the last goal. Hopefully, we can do the same at AGDQ 2017. I donated at the very beginning of the marathon; while 5.00 is not a lot, I still felt compelled to give just that little bit extra like everyone else.
Let's make next year's SGDQ goal even higher!
I almost forgot to donate. I'll remember to donate more during AGDQ! Great work, guys! 
Just woke up and heard something about singing. I want to hear singing.
HYPE PogChamp
We Did It Y'all ! ! !
$1.2Mil WE MADE IT!! 
So amazing. Really a giant thank you to everyone involved.
Thanks GDQ for an amazing marathon! 

Already donated my limit, but we need to blow that record out of the water! Here's my contribution.

I can't wait for the next GDQ event (especially if Yoshi's Woolly World gets on the schedule!)

Thank you to all the runners, fans, announcers, and crew for an awesome job. You rock!
Only been following on twitter, but wanted the fun to continue for you guys. Here's to the Mario 64 4-way race!
Go mario go!
Great job guys, this is a great cause and great runs 
Just like every GDQ, this one is blowing my mind! A big thanks to all the runners, staff, and folks watching and donating. You're all my heroes!
I wish i could give more for my first time donating but i made a promise to donate this year  and there is no way im not going to participate  in this amazing event! 
Missed most of the runs I was looking forward to, due to work and real-life, but I'm going to watch the YouTube replays!
S/o to everyone who made this fundraiser possible!
We just broke the record so let's set a new one! Don't stop now!
Better late than never <3
You cant finish a GDQ without donating! Keep it ups guys, thanks for this Great Event 
We broke the record!
I've been watching all week and Doctors Without Borders is a great group.
Gotta contribute to this amazing run. Thanks to everyone that has done their part to make this event happen.
The past couple of weeks have proven trying times for many. Yet amidst that a light has shined, a community united to celebrate the skills of many while simultaneously raising money to make a difference in the world. Thank you all who have participated in this event, whether as organizers, runners, or spectators. It's been great.
Keep it up! Almost there
For the record! WAAAAAAHHHHHHHH
Awesome event, great cause, fun times all around. Congratulations to everyone who helped pull this off. And remember, the cake is a lie!

I'm unemployed and homeless. Been watching these speedruns for the past week through the free wifi at our local starbucks and, after 10pm, the bar. Thanks for making my summer just a little bit more happy.

SGDQ HYPE!
Doing my part to keep this marathon even just a LITTLE bit longer!
I've watched archives of previous GDQ events, but this is my first year watching live and first donation, this whole week has been mind-blowing, I'm already so excited for the next one. Let's get that last incentive and break that record!
Hello! Great work once again, everyone!
Here's five dollars.

If everyone else watching who can afford $5 donates, we'll hit the goal for sure.
Waaaaaaaah
Such an amazing event from start to finish, and what an triumph with the amount donated this year.

Fantastic SGDQ this year.  Never fails to amaze me how closely knit and dedicated the community is toward the games that helped define childhoods.  First time donating to charity this year, and I could not think of a better time to donate.  Lets reach that goal!
I love Super Mario RPG and I love these events! I'm in the Army and I really appreciated your professionalism (even though it's mostly just for fun) and dedication to your skills. Furthermore the staff for their work for this cause.  KEEP IT UP MEN! HUA!
One more game please. Also Fizz is a nerd.
I'll double down on this donation if you pronounce my name correctly.
Super Mario 64 HYYYYPPPPEEEEEE!!!

Thank you for all of the fun all week! God bless :)
Puncayshun is the guy that first introduced me to speedrunning. Gotta see him win this SM64 70-star!
Joel get on Skype 
This has been the first games done quick that I've caught as it's happening and outside of messing with my sleep cycle, has been a lot of fun to watch. Thanks to all the folks involved from running to facilitating those runs.

Glad to support a great cause!
SGDQ2016 has been a blast, and if we can extend it a little further that'd be the best!
I've donated every GDQ, even when I couldn't afford it, so now I can, I can't not donate. I didn't get to watch as much as I wanted due to work, but it did provide the money to donate.

 I love everything you guys do and thanks to not only the runners, but the announcers, the sound crew, the audio crew, the techs, everyone else involved in running the GDQs and most importantly, EVERY SINGLE viewer and donator. We couldn't do this without you!
You're all lovely. <3
Donators can set records too.
Let's do it!

Thank you to all of the runners, and everyone behind the scenes for providing quality entertainment this past week. I don't have much money but I wanted to do my part! Super Mario 64 needs to happen! Love you all!
I think as incentive, Lackattack should agree to drink a died Pepsi on stream if SGDQ 2015 is beaten. Pepsimannnnnn!!!!
CHAT TAKE MY ENERGY!!!! And by take my energy I mean... MATCH MY DONATION!!!!  We can do this with the power of FRIENDSHIP MingLee
This has been an amazing week, and SMRPG is the perfect way to cap it off. Thanks to all the runners for their great performances!
An amazing SGDQ this year. Congrats to all the runners and to everyone behind the scenes. This SGDQ also helped me cope with the death of my 12 year old cat, Midnight. May he rest in piece.
Little late for the mine cart, but great run today, on my favorite Mario game all time.
Thanks for making the a better place. 
Those jumps tho. 
Mario is a god.
yay charity!
Let's go everyone! I'm giving more than what I probably should, but it's all for an amazing cause. Let's  get one more run to end it with a bang! 
Just recently discovered SGDQ and am pumped to see my first live event!  Would've donated more, but I didn't win MegaMillions last night.  Next time!
Thanks for all the hype SGDQ!  Very glad to donate to this cause!
This is all I can afford, fight me irl

Getting that last chance for donations in. Thanks for a great SGDQ this year! 
Thanks for the brilliant week, Pity Aus$ money doesn't go further.  We can do it!
To heck with it here's five more! What an amazing event as always. Thanks everyone for such a great week :)
Have watched the last 5 GDQ events, I have always loved Super Mario RPG was the first RPG that I ever played so I figured It would be a good time to donate. Was a blast to watch AGDQ again this year, can't wait for the next event.
Donating for a great cause. 
Guys, give Goku your energy, raise your dongers... do anything! We gotta hit this goal!

Wait! Do the thing that matters: Donate!
JUST DO IT!
I brought the Shake now you all bring the bake
OLD MAN RIVER HYPE
Lack, I'm having a lot of fun watching this run, but I gotta ask you, when are we gonna see a run of Big Nose the Caveman at a GDQ? :)
Never had a SNES to play SMRPG as a kid, but a pleasure to watch all the same!  Old Man River + SM64 HYPE~!
It's 12:00. It's High Noon.

A line you probably haven't heard in a long time.
Hey guy! Thank you for doing this wonderful event. I haven't been able to follow all of it this week. Glad everything is being uploaded to youtube so I can watch these on my own time :) I was waiting until Mario RPG to donate for those awesome Geno and Mallow plushies! Keep up the good work.
This is one of the hypest events I've  ever had the pleasure of watching, and I don't want this to end! Let keep this donation train rolling everyone!
I don't have as much as this Anonymous guy; he just keeps giving these huge amounts. But here's what I can give for now. Been watching for years now. Hope to make it out in the future and give more when I can!
Make America Great Again!
GOGOGO
The longer this run is, the more time there is to reach the goal. It is time for Summer Games Done... Eventually. Tell Lack to take his time.
I loved SMRPG so much. Although I would have to say that The Thousand year door is a the best Mario RPG. Chill out, relax. AND SM64 RACE HYPE!
Missed most of it throughout the week but had to come for the end!
Here is my contribution to extending SGDQ.  Thank you to everyone who puts this on.  It is awesome to see such a great community come together for a great cause.
I gotta say, such an insanely good event. From the hilarity of the Jak and Daxter run and the Sonic 06 - to the technical skill and knowledge of the Deus X run and the Reze's Low percent. I just had to be apart of the final push! Mario 64 HYPE
Looking forward to that Mario 64 race. We're almost there!
It turns out that creatures need memories so that they can perform wrong warps.
This has been an amazing week and it's time to cap it off with even more Mario!  Thank you, everyone!
Every little bit helps us get to the Mario 64 race. Shoutouts to Alice!
Congrats to everyone who made this week a success. 
Awesome week, awesome people, awesome games, awesome cause. To sum up GDQ in one word: HYPE.
Love SMRPG & have loved yet another GDQ. Here's one more donation in honor of everyone involved in the event, and for the great cause it represents.

Thanks everyone, and see yall next GDQ!
More mario please! 
Let's do this guys!
80$ for next year's save the animals!
Awesome event, awesome cause, thanks to the runners, announcers, and everyone who makes these events happen. 
I know it's not much, but i hope this helps. Thanks for the unforgettable week, and heres hoping for the great end to the run.
If even 1% of people watching now were to donate at least $5, we would blow this total goal out of the water
Races are the best
Sorry I can't give more, I'm a poor uni student.  BibleThump
is that the beautiful runescape player? The one in blue in the middle?
I took this week off from work and have had this stream on the entire time. I've enjoyed every minute of it but don't want it to end after this SMRPG run - bring on SM64! HYPE!
Lets get there!
Mario RPG? How could I not.
I admit it, I was one of those people that watched hours and hours of great runs without donating. I'm making amends and putting some money towards an amazing cause. 

Everything is fine!
Having a great week, haven't donated yet though so fixing that now. Here's to seeing that SM64 race!
I just got home from my very first GDQ. It was an honor and a privilege to attend and run in an event filled with so many wonderful people.

As much as I think the perfect end to the marathon is the one true Final Fantasy, Mario RPG, we can't let it end just yet. Let's get that race underway!
It's been a great SGDQ but why stop now? 
This is the part where everyone chips in, right? Well, I guess I'm part of everyone.
Gotta donate for both my favorite Mario game being destroyed as well as getting Super Mario 64 to be ran. Let's go Puncayshun. Yum!
If everyone donated a dollar for every bounce lack does this run then that would raise.. Umm.. A lot of money and I don't feel like doing math so SUPER MARIO 64 HYPE
I'm donating to keep the Speedrunning going as long as possible. A week of SGDQ is not enough. that Mario 64 run is so close I can taste it. 
Let's go 7 star! we can do this!
My girlfriend and I bonded over this game when we first started dating, and tonight I've finally got her to sit down and watch her first speed run events. 

We wanted to send in what we could to support a great cause and to say thanks for giving us something to bond over again. 
PPMD Kreygasm
Come on chat lets get this done
Why can't I find the Zelda Randomizer donation incentive?

I mean... Good luck Lackattack!  
It's 2am, time to beat a record!
Dooo. Eeeettttt. 
SMK64 LETS GOOOO
Holla from Japan!! My boyfriend made me watch SGDQ but I have thoroughly enjoyed every minute!! Thanks for the great plays all!
Thanks to all the runners and crew for another week of scintillating content in service of charity. You're an inspiration for gamers everywhere!
thanks to all the runners, commentators, support staff and viewers for an excellent SGDQ! so much #Hype
Not ready for it to all be over, one more game!
Thank you to everyone involved in the GDQ events. Great speedruns for a great cause. P.S. COME ON CHAT, DONATE! WE CAN DO IT! 4Head
it's around 8am here in Denmark, and I must cure my hangover with  a Super Mario 64 race
Thought I was done donating, but they threw in that SM64 curveball. It must happen. Come on guys, you can throw in another dollar or two! You don't want it to end, do you?
OH WOW DO YOU SEE THE TIME ON THE CLOCK

THAT MEANS IT'S TIME TO DONATE
GOGOGO
Games done quick has entertained for years and here's to it going for many more to come. Have to give a shout out to the Guildhall Podcast for getting me into it.
Hello announcer!
Haven't seen that much GDQ, but it's always a fun time when I do,  so here's my first donation to meet the goal.
Great event I've seen so far! Even though I haven't been able to watch every run due to work, It has been a blast for every moment I've watched. Keep up the good work!
for more mario
This is only five dollars, but it is worth 70 stars if we can all pitch in a five dollar donation each. Let's do this!
Wait, you're telling me that Mallow isn't a frog..? Next thing you'll be telling me is that Green Mario is named something ridiculous like "Luigi." 

You guys are doing great! Let's get that Super Mario 64 donation goal met and shatter the old SGDQ record!!
My part to that Mario 64 run. Come oooon, Old Man River!
This is my first ever GDQ and it's absolutely amazing.  Thanks to everyone for putting on a fantastic show!
Looks like you still need some help setting a new record. Take this.
Sorry I can't add in more! But here's ten dollars for the SM64 cause! Shout out to the runners, you're doing great! Good luck, guys. Let's hit that goal and see more more more Mario!
More SGDQ!
I challange every single soul watching to donate at least 5$ !   I'll kickstart 100$ to get the ball rolling!
Here's to a great cause, and a great gaming exhibition! Let's make this well worth the time of everyone watching, everywhere in the world!

It took me over a decade to finally get back to Super Mario 64 and get all 120 Stars after I first played. Watching a race to 70 would be more than worth the nostalgia.
I'm so glad I'm in a position to be able to give even a bit back to SGDQ for all the hours of entertainment and good it's brought me and thousands of others. Thanks for the amazing event!
WE WANT SUPER MARIO 64!
And more than anything else, we want more money for MSF!
Here we all work 'long the Mississippi
Im just donating so i can watch an SM64 race. (also to help out a good cause and for the hype)
Long live Doctors Without Borders and their patients! GDQ events are fantastic charity events, and everyone involved should be proud of themselves. Big round of applause and Klappas in Twitch chat for Doctors without Borders, GDQ organizers, and runners! We got this!
I'll match your minimum by 130%
thanks for the great week! :)
this SGDQ was A-Mei-Zing! so many entertaining runs and runners and so much generosity for a great cause. Everybody part of this deserves some high 5s! Penguins shoutout!
Old man river hype!
Donating $10 because someone in chat said they wanted to but could not afford it.
Guys, you aren't seriously going to let those people who ran SGDQ 2015 beat us here, are you? Let's GO!
I'm very proud of all of the runners and every GDQ event makes me happy that so many people are willing to take time out of their lives to help raise money for a worthy cause.

Also, I need 70 star race please.
now seems like the time to get one last minute donation in. SM65 HYYPPEE
clabe
I would be remiss to be watching this all week and *not* donate. Good luck reaching a new top donation total!
Cheers from Japan.
I can afford to eat sandwiches for a couple more days to finally get a donation in to GDQ. You sure know how to tug at a poor college student's heart with Super Mario RPG.
Can't give much, but I will do what I can.
Here's to Mario, my entry into gaming and I have to keep coming back for more. Let's keep these donations coming!
Thanks for taking me back to my grade school days!  I enjoy the commentary.  Keep up the awesome work!
Go!
Been watching all week, and usually have this on the background every year.  Here's to beating 2015!

Been watching all week, figure I should finally donate before SGDQ 2016 ends. It's not much, but every little bit helps! Thanks everyone!
This is my third time watching GDQ. You guys are doing wonderful work while giving me some of the greatest entertainment on the internet. I mean, where else will you get Pepsi Man! Let's get this final goal done and help those Doctors across those borders.
TY For the awesome week!

Ok, I seem to be asked to donate ... and damn I have no self control ;)
Great marathon; as always ;) finally ending :(
I've been watching GDQ since about 2013 but, now that I'm out of grad school and no longer disgustingly poor, I can finally donate!  I wanted to donate sooner but I kept passing out on the couch when the games I wanted to donate during were on... sorry about that. This is an amazing thing that you all pull  and I hope to continue watching for years to come. 
Loved SMRPG when I was growing up, still get excited when I pick it up now. Felt the need to donate to support a great cause, and because the Geno and Mallow plushies are so cute! Good luck on the rest of the run, kick Smithy's butt!
This run sponsored by Blockbuster Video. Best of luck to lack attack and mention GDQ at your local blockbuster tomorrow for a free video rental if lack PBs!
Loving this Super Mario RPG run! Thanks SGDQ for what you all do and thanks being a way for my brother and I to connect many many miles away! Also Pie how much do we need to give to have the announcer sing with ya? Money for 70 star race.

This was my first GDQ that I attended, and it was an absolute blast.  Thanks to all the runners for sharing their knowledge and skills about all the games, and a huge thanks to the staff who made sure everything ran smoothly.

For Liz
Saw the counter at 1,182,990 - couldn't help but put in enough to round out that number :)
Great marathon this year guys! Heres to the bonus 70 star. HYPE!
This has been an amazing SGDQ. Thanks to all the runners for the awesome runs. I wasn't able to catch everything live, but I'll watch the recordings of the things I missed. Here's my contribution to beat last year's donation total!

WE NEED SM64
Second Donation this SGDQ C'MON GUYS LETS BEAT LAST YEAR!
let's get SM64
Let's make this Super Mario 64 run happen! Thanks for a great SGDQ and to everyone supporting a great cause!
This GDQ has inspired me to finally get into speedrunning. Thank you for all the amazing entertainment this past week! RIP the animals :(
First Time watching, first time donating. Keep up the good work, much respect. Come on twitch chat, we can do this! SM64 Hype!
but before we reach our goal, we have to talk about parallel universes
I don't have much, but donating $5 for the second time. Come on everyone, we can do this! 
TAKE MY STRENGTH
ONE MORE GAME. ONE MORE GAME.
Every year we'm amazed by GDQ, from the runners crushing so many games, the entire community (WORLD!) raising so much money, and all the folks working behind the scene for such a great cause. Here's my last donation for tonight and this year. Let's finish strong and get all 70 stars!!! 
Mario Yippee 
MUST HAVE SUPER MARIO 64 RACE!!!!!!!!!!
Shoutout to Pie on the couch and heres to a run with good Super Mario RNG!
Our progress has been remarkable, but the fight is not over.  There's still one more goal for us to reach, and I know that we can do it.

Now is the time to act. If everyone in chat donated just $5 right now, we'd be well over our goal.  Whether you have good taste or demon tendencies, love or hatred of animals, we can put aside these differences to unite to help SAVE the world.  

This is Uncle Samus, and I want YOU to donate $5.
Thank you all for an awesome week. Got to watch GDQ with my 11 month old son, and he loved watching the different games.  Great memories made and I can't wait for AGDQ in January. 
Doctors without borders, so this donation is too.
Let's keep donating i know we can get the race to happen!
!
We can totally make it! Thanks for running my one of my favorite games of all time, let's make it to the SM64 run!
With the way things are going right now in Dallas and unfortunate situations that escalated, this is a good way to put some good into the world and at the same time watching some sick games being broken. Never donated before but I plan on doing so from now on. Keep up the good work, homies. Much love. 
I <3 you Boo
Without a doubt, Super Mario RPG is the most fun you can have on the SNES. I remember every single detail of this run, and I haven't  played it through in at least 10 years. Shoutout to the 502 Krew, Lack, and the couch for their incredible commentary.
Don't ask for much, but can Calebhart42 lift Pie for gains and help MSF?
COME ON!
EVERYONE, LEND THE DOCTORS YOUR POWER

DONOR BOMB
Would love to see last year's GDQ donation total get broken, and i'm not planning on sleeping any time soon, would love to see a smb64 run.  WAH!
As a pro game developer, I love the reactions in the studio office when we watch one of our games get destroyed by these amazing runners. Shoutouts to the tech crews, announcers, and behind the scenes people keeping this awesome show going.
It's only a little, but I want to do my part to make SM64 happen.  Lets do this!
I rarely get the chance to see the event out like this, and I'm psyched that it's ending with an amazing game. Much love.
We could hit the donation goal right away if about 6000 of us out of the 100 thousand plus watching donated 5 dollars. Let's do it boys! Speaking as a poor student, even our little donations can make a difference, both here and for people around the world.

For SM64 race
I'm sitting here watching all these $500 and $1000 donations coming in and thinking that there's no point in giving just $5. But then I saw that there are over 100,000 people watching on Twitch. If only a tenth of you give $5 then we'll blow past our goal. Please, if you can, DONATE DONATE DONATE!  I want to see Super Mario 64!
Thanks for letting me relive my fav game of all time!

Donating for a great event put on by a great community to support an even greater cause. Congratulations to all the runners!
Thanks for the amazing event! And for the amazing run! I wonder what would happen if everyone watching put in $5... i'm sure it would make the tracker go "WAAAAAAAAAH"
To answer Mallow's question, we are Bruce Lee and we'll smash that 64 k. Geno whirl hype.
I usually give 50$ per GDQ, upping by 5 for the sub 2 minutes mini game. Awesome week!

SGDQ is a fantastic event for a fantastic cause.  Now let's hit that SM64 goal!
Match me if you can!
I already donated a few times, but five dollars is a pittance for chat to pay for the SM64 race.

C'mon, you miserly bums! It's five bucks! You can find that in your couch cushions!

$5 each or r9k mode!
Thanks to all of the runners for an awesome week of entertaining runs!
last effort to get another game run
We're so close, we can be heroes today! Not the heroes the world deserves, but the heroes the world needs! Put your wallets up, chat, and give your energy to MSF!
You had me at Old Man River.

I hadn't donated yet, but getting that 70 star run is too good to pass up. Extra 20 for getting sheep attack.
Not much but doing my part. Come on SMB 64! Hype!
I just started watching speed runs and have been loving them. I just found out they were held for a charity called doctors without borders. I did research on them  and they seem like a great charity, with a great cause. Thanks for a great event!
For SM64 and Great Justice

Hey All, Yetee Glen here. I don't have any more shirt money, but I'm happy to throw my own to see that BLESSED SM64 Race. Please guys. We can do this, you gotta believe!
Super Mario RPG is one of the few RPGs I've ever played, and now you guys are making me super nostalgic for my childhood.
Oh my god! They Killed Geno!
I remember when this event was like 15 dudes in a basement and they raised like 9 grand. Even back then you could feel the magic of the event. I as with many others anticipate every GDQ. They're very special and words do little to describe the gravity around them. Gdq is my Super Bowl. Mario Rpg is my favorite game, thank you all for everything. MARIO 64 HYPE!
This is the last of my donation funds! Here's to an awesome SMRPG run and to the SM64 race! 
SGDQ has been amazing this year, and this SMRPG has been insane! Congrats to all the runners, and big thanks to the staff and volunteers at SGDQ. You all do something so nobel by showing your love for going fast in games. 

This is for SM64 race, and to beat SGDQ2015! :D
I donated 5 dollars for the mine cart time, but I got a freebie! So I'm donating five bucks again. SM64 HYPE!
OLD MAN RIVER
Just doing my part in this, despite how small it may be. Here's to everyone at the event and for such a fun and interesting week. And here's to that bonus incentive.

Someone mentioned something about pie and someone eating mine so here's a cool twenty to make sure this guy has a good night...

Old Man River!!! 
It's not much, but here's hoping we get that bonus Mario 64 race!
This is probably my favorite RPG of all time, and one of my favorite Mario games. Thanks to all the runners this week and the crew!

I have been watching GDQ since 2014 when i stumbled upon it on twitch, i was blown away and have watched every event since. It is about time that i donated as i am finally done university and actually have some money to put towards the cause. Thank you all for putting on such an amazing show.
Those jumps are incredible. Thanks for destroying my favorite SNES game. Thanks to all the amazing people  who put this wonderful event on each year.
I'm a vegan so don't tell anybody I said... I'm glad the animals died. M64 race hype!

Axem fight destroyed me as a kid, good to see a but of payback! Thanks Lack! 
Come on guys, if even 10% of chat donated $5, we could BLOW past the final donation incentive!
I absolutely loved Super Mario RPG as a kid, and I was so excited to grab it on my WiiU last week. Here is $5 so that not only do we get more games, but we get more viewers, therefore more donations towards a spectacular cause. Can we get some HYPE in the Showroom?!?!
If everyone in chat donates 5 dollars, we'll make it ezpz
This week has been incredible and the cause is amazing! Way to go!
No way we're not getting that race ! Everybody ask for your mom's credit card and donate. Waluigi counts on you.
I remember back in the late 1900s when I first played Super Mario 64 myself.  It was a special time back then.  You could go outside at night and leave your doors unlocked.  But you didn't.  Because you were playing Super Mario 64.  SM64 HYPE!
Been watching SGDQ with my 1 year old daughter who always stops to applaud the speedrunners along with the crowd. Thanks for doing this and being wizards!
Hey, This stream's better good!

Super Mario RPG is my favorite speed run to watch! Thanks so much to all the organizers and runners. This event makes me so proud to be a total geek.

Good luck Lack!
Give til it hurts...the animals
Finally donating after watching for a few years. Love the speed running community, keep plowing through these video games.
Super Mario RPG is a good way to round out an awesome week of speed running. But you know what would be a better way to end it? SUPER MARIO 64!!! Good luck to LackAttack on his run and  a big thanks to all of the GDQ crew for a job well done.
Super Mario RPG is one of those games that I just never quite finish. Good to watch the parts I missed in under 4 hours. 
I love Shy Guys! Oyasumi nasai!
Woot super mario 64

Might as well get this intended donation in.
Bust that record.
I have been glued to SGDQ all week. Thank you so much for putting on an amazing stream for a great cause.
I donated $20 earlier  this week and I needed to add even more. I think Super Mario RPG has a special place in my heart. I'm super happy to be watching this. Thanks to all the runners and everyone else who volunteered and participated at the gdq!! Give me a WAAAH Everyone!
GDQ makes me so proud to be a part of the gaming community. Look how much good we can do! I've been watching all week, and I had to donate again to help push for Mario 64. Thanks to everyone involved; you should be so proud of what you're doing. Much love to my GT chat and Easy Allies friends! <3 
We're in that "if everyone watching gives a dollar..." range.  Let's make it happen people!
Doing what I can for SM64. Come on, everyone, please make it happen!
Need to see that SMB 64 race.
waaahhh need more mario!!!
First time donating, GDQ has seen me through some tough times.  Thanks for all you do!  :D
Just want to thank everybody that takes part in GDQ. I've been watching for about 4 years now and its always a great time. Money goes towards SM64 race.
Although small, I had to donate before the end of the event. I encourage everyone watching to do the same!
We're so close! Let's bust that donation we made back in 2015 wide open! Keep it up Lack! GDQ HYPE!
Always look forward to GDQ, keeps me entertained for an entire week, then I get to watch the VODS for everything I missed. I appreciate all the dedication and hardwork that all these speedrunners put in and all the effort that goes in for this Charity event is awesome! Keep up the good work guys and I'll keep watching!
Shoutout to all the great runners who've made this event fun, shoutout to lack, good luck on sub 3 hours, and shoutout to sarah! Here's to seeing that mario 64 run!
All was peaceful in the Mushroom Kingdom until Smithy the sword shattered the Star Road! Wow!! So with his old enemy Bowser and a marshmallow who throws lightning, HAHAHAHA, Mario fought evil wedding cakes, and killer Venus Fly Traps, and recovered the 7 STARRRRSSSS!!!
 Great cause, great runs, I don't want it to end, let's beat last year's mark!  We need MORE MARIO! IN 64 BITS!
SMRPG was the first speedrun I saw at pie's stream,  and it's introduced me to the GDQ's and speedrunner's community that I've come to enjoy the company of. Glad to donate for a good cause. Rest in peace Mallow Route pieBleThump.
It'll be my 5th donation of the marathon, but I CAN'T miss an SM64 race. Let's meet that incentive so no one has to cry ~WAAHH~
