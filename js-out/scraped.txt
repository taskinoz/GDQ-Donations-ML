A Hat in Time is one of my favorite games and Now Kid is worth every cent
Long time lurker, first time donor. Happy to finally be able to contribute. I can’t wait to slack off at work all week as I watch the stream instead of doing my job. I wont say more, because there’s a distinct possibility that my boss is also watching. Jonathan, stay away from my desk this week.

The isk train has no brakes.
My great uncle died of cancer and my mother-in-law had a false positive a few years ago, so I always try to donate what I can each year. Keep up the amazing work and happy 10 years!
Smiley face from the crowd! :D
$10 for every year of GDQ. What you do with this event represents some of the best of what gaming can be. Keep it up!Put my donation to a childhood favorite, Tetrisphere. Fun fact: the game is actually rendered on a donut instead of a sphere! Mmmm donuts.
You folks rock! Hi friends at home I'm watching with! Trans Rights
Hey GDQ! This is my first time donating, and I have a very important question for Enhu: "Where is my guest difficulty?"
Been watching for quite a while, thanks for all the great memories AGDQ!
This is the first GDQ I've watched live and just had to donate! Good luck to all the runners
It's time again for another GDQ! Looking forward to a great week of runs.
If everyone watching donated $5 right now, we would blow past 500k right off the hat! (get it...because hats...) anyway $5 train hype!
Just wanted to thank everyone; GDQ Staff, the Runners and PCF. These marathons are a major highlight for my year. This cause is personal to me, having had several members of my family both pass and survive cancer, I'm sure in no small part thanks to organizations like this one. I cant thank you all enough so I hope this little bit helps! Can I get an early game "HYYYYPE!!" ?

[To be read during Mega Man 7]Praise-ed be to Bord, that most magnificent of misaligned animals! From his humble origins as mere glitched enemy in Battletoads & Double Dragon, Bord has grown into a memorable fellow with his great "wisdom" ("Great minds will eat you," anyone?) and including a swelling family including the cake-eating Fatbord, the exasperated Brod, and the possible(?) new arrival Flatbord. Let us hear the clarion call of our lovable friend: SQUEH!Thank you, PJ, for being a PJ. I hope Rush behaves today.
First day of gdq, hype! Good luck to all the runners!
Happy New Year and happy AGDQ, here's to an amazing week of speedruns! Let's kick cancer's butt!
Great race! Lots of fun tech and great movement, really close in the end too. Looking forward to my favorite 2D Metroid, Zero Mission.Putting it towards the first Bonus Game, Sonic 06!(If the site adds numbers to my name ignore them, it's simply TheMasterDS)

Very proud to see all of you guys here on stream, perhaps one year I'll be standing by your side.Good luck JRP, good luck Krunchy, and shoutout to all the GBAtroid community, one I can call a family.

GDQ's been one of my events to look forward to over the last few years... wait... why are you killing the dargons (Ridley)? And going to kill the metal dargon (Meta Ridley)?! I thought we were saving the animals! D:Donating for Sonic '06 bonus run because who doesn't want to see someone further break an already broken hot mess of a game?
commenting is hard. I can't think of anything I am comfortable with anyone reading. so I hope you all at gdq have a great week.
My wife and I are attending GDQ for the first time in person after watching online for years and we are SO EXCITED! We're so excited to see games run fast for a great charity, live.
Wow, 10 years?! That's really awesome. Congratulations to everyone who have made these events possible all these years.

hi, long time watcher first-time donor, I wanted to make this donation in me and my friend's name Guy Neil the third. he is a huge fan of metroid. We both lost our mom, his to cancer and mine to an autoimmune disease. He helped me get through the loss and I want him to know that there are people that are there for him, and I am grateful that he was there for me. I hope this helps prevent others from losing their moms. And further research in helping those who are dealing with this disease.
Love me some Zero Mission! Keep up the good work y'all :3
What's up GDQ 2020? First GDQ donation of the year, and first GDQ donation of the decade! This shoutout goes out to Covert Muffin, because without his laugh it just isn't GDQ. I love it when you do the Star Wars. Take a bath.
Just had to donate at the first GDQ I can attend in person! Shout outs to Trish, Reese, and Archer!
Can’t wait to watch SMB3 with my girlfriend later
First time managed to watch AGDQ from the very beginning. Glad community managed to beat last time record of donations before first game.
This is the first GDQ event i'm watching live and it's also my first time donating. I'm really glad to have found a nonprofit speedrun event like GDQ and will continue to watch all events going forwards. Here's to another decade of great runs, strange run tech, and HYPE! This donation goes towards Mario and Luigi co-op final boss.
Yay AGDQ!
I hear all this talk about PB... but wheres the J?!Dragondarc's choice!
Zero Mission is one of my favorite Metroid games! Great job to JRP, and best of luck to all of the runners this week! Donation goes to the DKC Filename "krool," a name I used when I first got 100% on this game when I was younger.
My dad likes to call them burnt bags (overcooked chicken)
Roger isn’t the bro we need, but the one we deserve.#RogerTheBro
Is Samus a Magical Girl?
Hi GDQ! This year’s event resonates with me more than usual, partly because of how far you’ve come since your humble beginnings, but also because my father-in-law was diagnosed with prostate cancer just a few days ago. We’re waiting for results from additional exams, but in the meantime, here’s 30$ for hope, awareness, and thanks for all of the speedrunning community’s efforts throughout the years.
Hello Runners!! Gotta donate for 1 of my favorite games of all time coming up today The Binding of Isaac!! Love seeing this game back on stage!! Good luck to all the runners this week!!!
AGDQ is one of the two highlights of my year! I love seeing all the amazing talent on show!
Just imagine the Kraid fight from his perspective: you're a giant lizard and have this puny human pop up. You're ready to crush them but instead they shoot 3 missiles at you and you just die in about a secondThanks to for the great speedrun!
This is my first time being able to donate to GDQ and I'm glad I'm able to do it during the Zero Mission run, since the GBA metroids were my introduction to the series. Best of luck to all the runners this year!
Thanks for calling this to our attention, Daniel! This is very important work.
I can't do much but here's a little bit to do my part. Lost too many of my family to cancer and it shouldn't happen to anybody. lets band together and put that cancer in it's place.
So excited for another GDQ. Thank you to all of the volunteers for your hard work! Jealous of my pals Adamrious, Slick, and Edardris who are in attendance. Maybe next year!
Choo choo!
Had to put in my first donation during a PJ run because my name is also PJ. May the power of all PJs flow through you and carry you to a world record. looking forward to an awesome week of games, friends, and charity!
Awesome Zero Mission run for a great cause, game on guys!

Good luck to all the runners.
Hey all! R recently my other nan has been diagnosed with several cancers and we know we don't have a lot of time left with her. It's not much but I hope this can help towards the cause, so someday no-one will have to go through this.
Gimme that metroid mug!

Samantha (age 13) and Leia (age 9) are donating in memory of their grandma who was taken too soon by cancer. They hope this will help ensure that someone else doesn't lose a loved one to cancer.

Good luck PJ! Super Baseball Simulator showcase next GDQ?
A great Start to the Marathon, and I'm looking forward to PJ's run.
Always look forward to GDQ!
It's compelling to think that this has been going on for 10 years now. That's a significant chunk of my life.
Thank you PJ, PLC, and Games Done Quick for all the entertainment throughout the years. And just remember- Do the thing. Let this donation go to PJ's choice.
It's somehow a little bit ironic, that AGDQ starts on the exact same day my grandma dies due to late complications of her brain cancer. One more reason to donate for the fight against cancer!Keep on running, guys!
Here we go again! Have fun guys!
Shoutout to the comfy speedfriends all watching. Greetings from scotland.
I had to donate $50 for Riven cause I need to see a game that took me 11 years to beat get finished in less than 15 minutes.
Deer Force!
Hat in time was a great opener and Metroid Zero Mission is epic! What a great start to my favorite time of the year! Welcome back GDQ! Hype!
Been watching GDQ for as long as I can remember and have never donated. Here's 50 English pounds. Keep up the good work!
I have no idea what Myst is but I see this bid war has nothing on it so might as well put some money on it. Might as well see what happens when you save this Saavedro character. Is it like "Saving" or "Killing The Animals"? Let's find out.
Long time viewer, first time donater. Looking forward to another week of incredible runs. I especially can't wait for the Bad Games Block.
cheers
It's GDQ time and Obligatory Twitch Prime sub Reminder. I'll be watching all week and can't wait for the EDF run with our heckin good guy Halfcoordinated.

Hi guys, glad to be here for the first GDQ of the decade! I've been watching since 2014 and try to donate a bit every year. Put this toward the Sonic 06 run.

2nd donation for a great opening line up for AGDQ2020!
This is the best time of year, cheers to usatei and eyegush.
Did I hear Sonic 06?
Someone needs a new mug and to help raise money for cancer research. I admire y'all even more now than before since a cancerous tumor was found and removed from my father's lungs a few years ago.Also, HI HALFCOORDINATED!
Had to donate during my favorite game of all time, Megaman 7!Thanks GDQ for keeping awesome and the runner for representing the 32bit Megaman community!

GDQ 2020 HYYYYPE! Go Mega Man!
My dad lost his fight with pancreatic cancer in March, so I am pumped to be able to donate to a cause that could help people with this. Growing up, gaming was our thing. I had to donate during Mega Man 7 in his honor since this was one of the games I remember watching him play when I was little. Thanks for supporting a great cause!
Been watching GDQ since 2013. Can't get enough of this awesome community supporting this awesome cause.
Had to donate while my favorite runner PJ was playing, donation to his choice.
My kids and I love GDQ. Thanks to all the staff, runners, and volunteers who make it possible. Let's go fast and raise money for charity.
WINKY IS A FROG
Greetings form Poland to all You guys! Great work everyone.
Here's to a good cause!
1st time being able to catch a GDQ live, and so happy to be able to give to such a good cause. I lost my uncle to lung cancer last year, and my other uncle is currently battling prostate cancer. Donation goes to runner's choice.
I've been watching GDQ's for years but this is the first one a I can share with my two month old daughter Aubrey. Doing my part to make sure that she may see an end to cancer in her lifetime.
I'm having to work overtime this weekend and y'all are keeping me company. keep up the hype!
Happy 10 year anniversary GDQ!!!Good luck to PJ on the run. Let's go good boy skip!
I am more than a robot! Die Wily!
Lost my mom to cancer last year and i want revenge, let's donate to kill cancer and get revenge on the lives it's taken. Also enjoying the guy in the audience in the blue shirt who was rocking out to the awesome music. happy 2020 everyone!!
Hey ColourCloseToCyan here, I try to donate each year during PJ's run, wishing all the runners the best with their runs this year. Go Team Poor Life Choices.
Hard to believe it's been 10 years, here's to PJ continuing to break games in very unique ways and team poor life choices
Greetings from the frosty north of Norway! Stoked to catch the beginning of the marathon, and exited to see the spectacular runs ahead of us. This donation goes to PJ’s choice - hopefully it goes to something terrible during the awful block.
My boyfriend is A HUGE megaman fan. He's on the couch behind the runners right now. Hi babe! Thanks for introducing me to this AWESOME event
PJ, here's hoping spontaneous combustion and falling through the floor are minimal during the run. Thanks for all you do for the speedrunning community and the charities supported!
hey pj, been subbed to you for almost 3 years and actually caught your stream less than 5 times so clearly I know the best way to spend my money. Here's some money to see if doctors without borders knows of some good ways to spend it too
Finally able to donate during a PJ run just to say "thanks"! I started watching speedruns after being linked to one of PJs Bionic Commando Rearmed runs and now I'm absolutely hooked. I'm just finishing up night shift in Australia - thanks to PJ for the amazing runs, and to GDQ for preserving my sanity in these last, few hours before I get to go sleep.
Always happy to tune in and watch these awesome speedruns every year, especially when its for a great cause. My mother and sister have both beaten breast cancer, and I have started early testing to keep an eye on my health. Thank you for all that you do and good luck to the runners!! Cheers!
Greetings from Germany. Good Luck on the MM7 run and lets all make this week awesome.
PJ, Don't forget to do the thing - Also good luck to you and all the runners.
Watching GDQs over the years got me interested in understanding how video games work and now I work in the games industry making games! What y'all do is awesome. Have a great GDQ!
Only been watching for a few years. Love the event. My first chance to donate. Spent yesterday catching up on the 10year anniversary CGDQ Mega Man Runs. Love being able to watch Mega Man 7 live with my boys.
I have always enjoyed GDQ and this year it hits a bit closer to home, so this year I'm donating in loving memory of my Uncle Mike who passed away from intestinal cancer late last year. To a new decade, hopefully, one with less cancer.
Hi PJ! Im hoping Rush doesnt troll you with searching this run.
Hoping for Metroid tumbler, thank you for such a wonderful zero mission run just now. Metroid means a lot to me and I’m happy that while everything is going crazy around me this community will still be so happy. Good luck all upcoming runners! *dab*
Hey, good luck on one of my favorite runs PJ! Heres a few bucks to a good cause!
Though I'll be at work for part of the run the world must see Sonic '06 in it's messy glory
Yes! One of the best 2 weeks of the year is back. Time to get hype!
Been watching since 2015 and can finally donate for the first time. Such a great event, keep going forever!
A FIGHTING ROBOT MEGA MAN
Good Luck PJ
Glad to be able to catch one of my favourite event of the year on the first day! Here's to an amazing week and good luck to every runner!
You've got this, PJ "most GDQ runs" DiCesare! Here, take this "AntiPanic B" battlechip.
Mega Man 7 is kind of weird, but it still ended up being one of my favorite MM games. Good luck fighting "Dr. Willy!"
HI AGDQ. My Grandmother and my uncle died by cancer. So here a somme $ to support the fight against cancer and prevent families from that i have experienced.
I'm not able to watch many streams, but everything I've seen of PJ leads me to think he's very genuine and earnest in what he does. I hope to see more of him going forward. Good luck on the rest of the run, and to all the runners to come.Per my personal GDQ tradition, I'm putting this donation towards naming the Zelda filename GirlLink, as much of a long shot it is to win.
Sorry Im late to the joint, but good luck, PJ! I'll donate 50 more if Rush becomes a good boy at the beginning of the final boss fight. Also looking forward to the Mega Man 4, 5, and 6 relay race! Mega luck! (Teleports out)
*To the best of your abilities, say to the beat of the Fresh Prince Theme*This is a story all about howVideogames got flipped turned upside downI'd like to take a minute just site right thereI'll tell you how speedruns became kings of the new yearIn a basement CGDQ was born and raisedOn a couch speedrunners started the crazeChilling out maxing, relaxing, making speedruns look smoothShooting down records as fast as they couldWhen a couple of guys they were up to do goodStarted raising money for the common goodI watched one little run and and saw how much everyone caredAnd said "I'm watching every year, this is HYPE I declared"
C'est ici qu'on donne pour Anis13k?
Always been a Mega Fan. GLHF.
special shout out to my buddy stephen for introducing me to this wonderful event a few years ago. looking forward to a fantastic week of amazing runs and even more amazing donations. good luck to all the runners
Phawahahaaaa! Greetings from Finland!
Happy 10th anniversary ! Greetings from Germany!
Lets go GDQ! I usually donate during the Megaman X blocks but seeing PJ run a Megaman game is awesome! Lets beat cancer and hit 2 Million this year! Good luck to all runners.
Putting this towards the Sonic '06 bonus run, because that sounds like exactly the kind of beautiful broken mess of a game I love seeing at GDQ.
Megaman 7 was my first game in the franchise and I glad to see it broken, give Turboman the beating he deserves PJ and can I get a $1 train going for all the other people who are watching GDQ in a VR headset right now? .... Am alone in that aren't I?
Yaasssssss! Starting the new year off RIGHT, with AGDQ, PJ, and Mega Man 7!!!! Thanks for 10 years for fantastic speed runs! Hats off to all the runners, the crew, and everyone helps support this great event.
Hi PJ, great run so far. Hope to see you someday run the Spencer Screaming Simulator again.
Thank you all so much. My son and I are excited to watch another AGDQ. Happy New Year. Let there be peace! Let this be the decade we defeat cancer! Much love to you all.

Putting my donation towards hearing Gehn sing. Riven was the game I obsessed over during my fresman year in college. Me and my friend Gilbert would meet after classes and spend hours at his computer going over every detail. Somewhere in a box in a closet somewhere I probably still have the notebook filled with our maps and clues where we worked out the mysteries of the D'ni number system. Hats off to the runner, and remember to check behind every door!

Hello everyone, John Dip here from the hit movies, Piyerts of the Kardashians. I'm here with Yarnold Yortsin Yayger from the hit movies, Urgmignaters. We are upset to see no one having started the hash tag donation chain for $20.20. We are here to start that chain. Love watching GDQ as we are making our new films, keep them Donations coming - #$20.20.
Fulfilling a promise to LogicPuzzle for kindly gifting subs to over 150 people in the chat he deserves alot of praise for contributing to such a cause!
Hey AGDQ like the event like the runs go on go fast :D @germench finde super wie ihr euch reinhängt mach weiter so :D
Sonic 06 is just the right amount of terrible to be an amazing run.
Vidya Games being broken? Great prizes? A great cause? AND a week off?! Sounds too good to be true! But it is! Get 2020 off to a great start!
For all the Bwahaha's. We love you Covert!

My gramma passed away 4 years ago now from Throat cancer; I am honoured to donate in her memory! The work GDQ does for the Prevent Cancer foundation is incredible and inspiring.
You're awesome, Uncle PJ!
Favorite runner playing my favorite series? I think I'm legally obligated to donate at this point!
Great job with Mega Man 7! I love that AGDQ is kicking off with the likes of Metroid and Mega Man this year. That inspired me to donate early! Good luck to the runners.
I have such a busy week ahead of me I fear I might not have time to watch all the GDQ epicness. You all do such great work though, keep on keeping on!
Hey KillaLombax! Glad to see my favourite duo back at GDQ for the 10th anniversary, and for the first time on a PS3 episode!Shoutouts to all the Racpack as always, and keep on exploring the galaxy as you always do, one Ravager whip at a time. Love from France!

Hey, deuxième fois que je regarde l'AGDQ, la dernière fois, j'avais gagné le panier garni, encore merci :) Vous faites (toujours) du bon boulot et je regarde pas beaucoup de speedrun, mais à force de découvrir cet univers, c'est très intéressant, surtout quand c'est pour la bonne cause. #TempeteDivine
Definitely not my first time watching,Definitely won't be the last,But it is my first time donating 🧡
Merci LFR pour ces resreams chaque année, merci aux commentateurs. Bourrez les dons ;)#GDQup
Donating so that in the future no one has to experience breast cancer the way that my mom did.
Woot!
appreciate the passion of speedrun and collect for a good thing!
Watching for the first time and blown away by the excellent runs for a such a good cause
Thank you to all the runners and organizers!
Happy 10th anniversary, GDQ! We've been catching the events live since 2015 and love them every time! Big thanks to runners, staff, volunteers and PCF! Good luck and have fun this week!
Thanks for all you do GDQ
GDQ HYPE!
#DarkMage
Ratchet and Clank nostalgy is the best kind of nostalgy.
I sank hundreds of hours into Ratchet and Clank on the PS2, and I can't wait to see it crushed at AQDQ.Life's short, why not make games short too?
First time watching AGDQ live, and super excited to see this Tools of Destruction run, seeing as it was one of the games that got me into the Ratchet and Clank series, and despite its history of freezing and refusing to load on my PS3, I still love to go back to the game. Even though it technically isn't the right phrase for this game, let's annihilate Tachyon, the Cragmites, and cancer.
When I saw that today AGDQ was starting, I screamed of joy. Can’t wait to donate more during one of my favorite weeks of the year!
Started watching GDQ (and speedruns in general) this past fall, and this is my first time catching one live! I love how supportive this community is of the LGBT+ community and of course, how much money we can raise multiple times a year for a great cause!
Thanks for the great work!
Gotta donate for Ratchet & Clank Speedruns.
Good luck to Runners!
Mario Time? I guess that'll be later.
My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 renal cell cancer. While he's still fighting the good fight, putting in this donation to hope that less people in the future have to go through what I'm going through. Putting this towards the Riven Easter Egg, since my dad and I use to play Riven together when I was a kid.
Love to see Ratchet & Clank get some GQD love!
Greetings from Chile, it's my first time donating to the GDQ. I watch the stream since 2012 and my dream is to go one day as a spectator. GDQ is my favorite event and you fill my heart with happiness every time I see you. XOXOXO
I love you PJ!
I love GDQ and have been watching vods for ages. Excited to catch one live! Best of luck to all the runners
Good luck on the run Killalombax!
First time donating and what more fitting way than for the 10th year anniversary. The event has been great so far and we're all doing it for a great cause! Good luck to all the runners!
Best wishes from Germany
With over 1,000 hours into The Binding of Isaac, I am really excited to see StoneAgeMarcus destroy this game with ease!
Chic, je vais pouvoir (pour changer) rester couché une semaine en regardant plein de jeu, c'est la patte ! Signé : un toutou nommé Kubo. #DarkMage
I love Ratchet and Clank. Casual. No fancy stuff for me.Good Luck
Happy to donate and watch GDQ with friends as it's been a tradition for 2 years now. Good luck to the runners and super hopeful to see the Sonic '06 run!
I don't know what to say but here's money
My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer, and it's because of organizations like PCF and others dedicated to new treatment options and breakthroughs that she's going in for treatment instead of less positive outcomes. Thank you, GDQ, and thank you PCF. You've helped so many, and I want to help in turn!
Hello everyone ! i'm really proud to participate at the 10th birthday of the GDQ. Good luck for all speedrunners and see you later i promise ;) PS : sorry if my english is bad, kisses from France <3
The Myst games were some of the first I ever played. I can’t wait to see them on the big screen for an hour.
My dad went to his doctor with a pain in his leg mid-2018. After an entire year of endless visits, and medical tests to eliminate all possibilities, he was finally diagnosed with a rare case of Hodgkins lymphoma. He has ended his final bout of treatment, with his last scan in 2 weeks to confirm his chemo has eradicated all remnants of this terrible disease. His nurses in my local cancer ward have been so supportive though every step of the healing process, and I have nothing but the highest respect for any medical staff helping all others who are going through this too. I couldn't think of a better time to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation than during a run from one of my favourite franchises of all time, one of the few franchises in which I have perfected practically every installment. Dr. Nefarious is best villain. LAAAAAAWREEEEEENNNNNNCCCCCEEEE!!!!!!
Greetings from Finland! Thank you for doing this year after year.
hi! this is my second time watching gdq and i'm so stoked! shoutout to my boyfriend kyle for getting me into this awesome charity cause!
I just wanted to say...KAAAZOOOO! (This one is for you Collin)
The best part of a new year!
I had to donate during my favorite game series of all time. Thank you runners and GDQ staff. Oh, did you know, all of the regular and prime subs money goes towards the total donation amount? Get the twitch prime sub wave going! :)
Oh goodie... I got to make a donation, and here I thought it'd never go through whilst floating through space on this asteroid. Hope sir doesn't mind using him to amplify the signal to do this. Put this towards the Star Wars bonus rash level
Happy 10th anniversary GDQ ! Here's to ten more years and to another wonderful week of awesome speedruns !
Very happy to see a Myst block this year. Saving Saavedro showcases more of Brad Dourif's performance range in Myst III: Exile. As they say in D'ni: Shorah!
battons le cancer

Loved playing Ratchet & Clank games as a kid, especially the Future series. Happy to donate to a great cause. Good luck to the runners!

Donating early to call out my students, hopefully some of them will follow suit and donate. Thank you AGDQ staff and supporters for showing what can be accomplished with Video games.
First time donation and being here at GDQ Let's take cancer out back and beat it down.
Greeting AGDQ, and Happy New Year. What better way to start 2020 than with a full week of nice games speedily completed, and donations toward a good cause.
Still amazed to see what's possible within games like Ratchet & Clank watching those speedruns. I'm happy to support this great event and the Prevent Camcer Foundation.Greetings to everyone and good luck to the speedrunners.
First of multiple 10 dollar donations in honor of the 10 year anniversary. Shout out to the two kittens on my couch Arthur and Lucas.
I am not patient enough for Speed Runs. You are doing an awesome job! Keep going!!!
I love GDQ, and I'm so hype that it's GDQ time again! Thanks to everyone at work behind the scenes to make this happen. $3 million hype!
Watching from Middlesboro, Kentucky love you all show gamers can change the world
Been watching for years through times both good and bad. About to start up schooling again after some detours in life, and you happened to set the event to the week before I'll start being busy with that. Thanks!
Lets a go!
LAWRENCE !!! CRUSH THIS LOMBAX !!!
I LOVE THIS STREAM!
Congratulations from Germany on raising money for the good cause.
So you mean to tell me, that I can help charity, win awesome prizes AND see more of CovertMuffin by simply donating? That's a great idea! Let's do that, shall we? Good luck to Covert and all the other runners, may RNG be with you.
Gotta do a little anime cancel.
(to the tune of the SpongeBob Squarepants theme song)Who lives in a TIE Fighter near Yavin 3Covert Muffin,Friendly and funny and well bathed is heCovert Muffin,If speeder crashes be something you wishCovert Muffin,I hope that Rosh's head is removed with a swish,Covert Muffin,Covert Muffin,Covert Muffin,Covert Muffin.(donation towards bonus Rosh level)
Did you ever hear the awesomeness of Covert Muffin The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Sith would tell you. It's a Jedi legend. Covert Muffin was a Grand Fwahaha-er of the Jedi, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to PB runs live…
zelda is the boy
No comment
5 for the blue tshirt guy in the front row ^^ keep them moves up
A friendly reminder to all who are donating to check if their employer does charity gift matching. Mine does and will be doubling all my donations over the course of the week!
Had to catch some Star Wars action from GDQ! This is the way. From San Antonio, with love!
If everyone donated 5 bucks right now... I can't do math but that would be a lot of money!
Thank you AGDQ for helping to make the world a better place. Blessings to all those effected by cancer.
glad to support such a great cause and stay hydrated bois!
I just thought Puwexil should know that Twitch chat has dubbed him "Dance Dad" - Keep it up!
#REDSABOROP Muffin Muffin! What are you doing?! This mod did something unthinkable... It took some NPCs and raised them to new heights! Especially Howlers, LITERALLY, I mean they're flying now. When lightning strikes, don't worry if you can't see. But do know that neither can Muffin. If you thought Kylo Rens lightsaber was cool, you havn't seen this mod yet! From saber maces to fingernails, I hope they prove a worthy challenger. Though not as worthy as the bikes who shall haunt you FOREVER muhahaha. Good Luck :)
Greetings from Israel, lovely people! Keep up encouraging others. Ratchet and Clank was awesome!
First time donating but have been watching for years. Much love to the runners, staff, and community for a truly wonderful cause.
Shout outs to covertmuffin, the only Star Wars character that's cuter than Baby Yoda. May the Force be with you, and may the Baths be Taken!

You're already saving the animals, so you might as well save Saavedro while you're at it.
My dad and I love watching GDQ.
Good luck on the run! May the RNG be with you!
My dad just finished his last round of chemo. Here's to helping prevent that for others.
My best friend and I make a tradition of watching GDQ. Always a great time for a good cause. Good luck to all the runners!
5$ per person watching? Sounds like a donation train to me. Choooooo chooooo!

Love covertmuffin, love AGDQ!
Long Time Viewer, first time donating, and to what a good cause.Two of my close family friends passed away because of cancer this year and it seems like the good time to give to help fight this ugly dehumanising monster.Thank you everyone for creating such a wonderful event, thank you AGDQ, Le French Restream. Let's fight for our close ones, Adrien, Sandra, Jacques this is for you. I love you !PS : Love you Covertmuffin, you da best (From Paris)Spectateur depuis longtemps et enfin donateur ! Après avoir perdus deux amis proches cette années à cause de cette saleté ça me paraissait le bon momentMerci à toute l'équipe du French Restream, à l'AGDQ et à tous les gens qui créent autant de bonne humeur autour de ce combat.

I always look forward to Muffin's runs at GDQ. Good luck and may the force be with you!
I love this game. Ravensoftware is one of my favorite companies, and I hate how Activision is forcing them to work only on COD. Have you ever heard of Singularity? It's one of my favorite games by Raven. It's an awesome Sci-Fi FPS game. I would love to see you play it to give it more exposure.
Bonus levels? I love bonus levels!
I love you GDQ! <3
Muffin you are a wonderful runner with an infectious wholesomeness, let's get that incentive done.
Good luck CovertMuffin! Always enjoy watching your runs and commentary!
First time ever donating to GDQ. No one should have to suffer the horrors of cancer so everyone should give whatever they can and stop cancer in its tracks. I'm constantly amazed at the level of skill put on display at these events, Good luck to all the speed runners.
Good luck on the run Mr. Muffin! Your enthusiasm is infectious and a pleasure to see. Here's to 2020 and a lot more reasons to FWAHAHAHA! All the best to the community, Doctors without Borders, and all you viewers at home. HYPE!
That couch looks a bit empty still, let's fill it up!Good luck on your run Covertmuffin!
*Wilhelm Scream*
now this is podracing
Shout out to my friend Andres who is literally dabbing right now to your incredible performance on that speeder bike.
Thank you all once again for another year of AGDQ. My friends lost their son to leukemia and so I try to donate every year in his memory. This is for Connor and so no other parents need to endure such a situation. Runners choice for incentives.
Hey, velociraptors and underwater sandworms aside - this mod still makes more sense than Rise of Skywalker, wouldn't you say?
Never even heard of this game before! Donating simply because Covert Muffin is such an enthusiastic runner! Also, I like to think that these insane glitches are simply due to expert use of the Force
Coucou, merci leFrenchRestream pour votre restream de L'AGDQ depuis toutes ces années ! Continuez comme ça, Courage pour cette semaine à tous les ambianceurs et commentateurs !#Goupix
#REDSABOROPGreetings from fwahaha! I'm loving this run, and Muffin's energy is so emblematic of what makes GDQ such a great event.Perhaps we should put a bit of this donation towards buying him a second couch... at this rate he's gonna need it. Or maybe a replacement speeder bike?Save the frames, pet the animals, take a bath, and kill the Jedi Council!P.S. twitch chat, it's time for cute fwahahas.
Always a blast watching a run by Covertmuffin. Good luck and may the force be with you!
Yay covert muffin!!!
Hello GDQ team and awesome people in the crowd, glad to catch the event from the first day. Thanks alot to the GDQ team for the amazing work over the years. So, to get back into the mood, can i get a HYYYYYYYYYYYYPE PS. Love to all of you and greetings from Germany <3

Here's to my grandma and grandpa, both of whom succumbed to cancer last year. We lost them both suddenly and without almost any warning, just six month apart from each other. I don't have much, but here's hoping that someday we can kick cancers butt for good. Lots of love from Finland, and good luck on the run!!
covertmuffin's laugh literally clears my skin. also super cool that you guys added pronouns!!!
Here's the 100 I promised for the deaths in my run plus an extra 100 for the softlocks i got in practice
Can't mistake that laugh
hi guys! be fast be good and kill the animal
This is the way!
I can't believe I missed the first 6 hours of GDQ! Glad I got in on the first day to start making my usual daily donations! Nothing better than supporting charity and good will in video games at the same time!
It's always a joy watching covertmuffin with his laugh as iconic as Chewbacca's growl. So, in order to make him laugh, here's a joke. Why did episode 4, 5, and 6 come out before 1, 2, and 3? (Read in best Yoda voice to unlock another $10) Because in charge of directing, Yoda was.
The true Force Power is Quake 3 momentum physics.
If everybody is watching donates 5 bucks it would really be a nice 700,000. Wouldn't it be awesome to break the first million by tomorrow?But as I know that not all people can donate, I can cover 3 of them as well!
Thanks for all the hard work!
I've never seen this game before and yet I am super entertained. Thanks for the awesome run and commentary!
love the runner <3
Seeing AGDQ again is brightening my stressful house hunting week. It's always fantastic to see Covertmuffin so here's some money for his cheerful laugh.
This Jedi Academy run is Lit!
first time donating to gdq. love this event, love riven. i hope that we can get that opera incentive in time, but it looks like the ending has not yet been written.
Fwahaha! May the force be with you : )
We can unlock the couch, but sadly the Recliner is DLC and the Sectional was a preorder bonus. Happy ten years of GDQ!
Always amazing to see (and hear!) uns by covertmuffin! Good luck with the run!
The Dark Side of the Speedrun is a pathway to many frame skips some consider to be... Unnatural.
Happy 10th anniversary, GDQ! Had to donate when I saw an unmet Myst incentive.
I feel like donating covertmuffin himself to the prevent cancer foundation for extensive research on the effect his laugh is having on cancer could prove extremely useful since I haven't heard a laugh as cancer-curing as his ever before. Looking forward to his runs every time!Greetings from Berlin, Germany.
Nice
Rosh? Take my money!
Locking your commentary couch behind paid DLC? That's just cruel man! You're an awesome dude and keep up the fun bike launches :)
Let's get this started! Can I get a HYPE?!?
Glad to throw down for a good cause! Put this towards announcer's choice.
Always love GDQ. Great cause. keep it up :)
Never donated before but I've watched CovertMuffin vods too many times not to when I finally get to watch him live at GDQ.
First donation this year, been watching and donating for... 7 years now ? Oh boy ! As always, thanks every single one of you people for your dedication to this awesome event supporting a cause that is very important to me.Happy anniversary GDQ, here is to 10 more years of speedrunning generosity !

Thank you for AGDQ, always entertaining, forever helpful!

I've never watched Muffin before this event, and I absolutely love the energy and passion he has for this run! I'm going to reinstall this game and mod to try it myself. Much love for all the runners a hosts. Never forget... the ORB.. Have a great day everyone!

Much love to all.
This is in the memories of my late chosen grandpas, Lon, Gary, and Len, who each died of cancer. I miss them so much.Save Saavedro!
I had to donate for Muffins run, his runs always cheers me up.
Maybe the doors should make themselves useful. Having a great time watching Muffin’s run (as always)!
My favorite runner running one of my favorite games. May the Fwahaha be with you, always. P.S. HEY WATCH IT!

Good times, and have fun!!
Yoda Voice: Eyrrrrrrr
Hey AGDQ,I've been tuning in to this event for the last few years, and I really admire what you guys do. I lost a brother to cancer last year, so I'm donating to the cause in the hopes we someday find a cure for this terrible disease. Save the animals?
go marcus!!
Fantastic run by our lively CovertMuffin! First donation of the week for me and looking forward to more!
Covert, you made me cry so I donate again.
hey everyone, vats here! i love you all once again, i can't wait for this to really get going putting in my donation for those SICK metroid prizes. Let's keep this train going and break that record!!! I hope everyone loves my print this year too
I'm playing The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ right now while watching the GDQ. I need to donate during The Binding of Isaac run. Keep up the good work and happy 10th anniversary GDQ!
Glad to see my passion for video games has come this far helping raise money for amazing foundations. Keep up the great work, I watch every year and will continue to support these amazing causes.
I always enjoy watching Covert Muffin do a speed run, and especially appreciate his positivity, laughter, and vulnerability. Let's do this, AGDQ!
I had to donate after that touching poem from CovertMuffin. BibleThump
Another GDQ, another donation! Let's prevent cancer through the power of video games!
We love you covertmuffin.

#CoeurNoir	Vive isaac, enfin au GDQ!
I always love AGDQ, I wish we could do this stuff weekly though I know if we did we would suffer from event fatigue so we just need to donate while we have the chance.
Here’s to another year of gamers coming together to do good and I had to donate after an amazing run by Covertmuffin and can’t wait to see the amazing Gymnast later tonight
I never gave permission for my likeness to be used in Chameleon Twist, please remove me from the bid war.
Best of luck to all the runners!!

Can't wait for the SMB 3 race!
Un petit don pour un geste qui me semble malgré tout important. Parce que cette saloperie continue de nous enlever nos proches, il est nécessaire de prendre conscience que nous pouvons tous, à notre échelle, agir dans le bon sens (contre le Cancer mais bien d'autres choses aussi).Merci de continuer de donner de la vie et un sens à ces évènements, courage à tout le staff. Bises (mettez la somme sur l'incentive que vous voulez, là où c'est nécessaire)#MarioLight
I have been both addicted to and afflicted by The Binding of Isaac for a few years now, so no better time to donate, right? Thanks to all the runners and the GDQ team for these inspiring and fun events. I'll be watching all week; best of luck!
<3
Cette fois-ci je ne me tromperai pas ! Des bisous et un Bretzel pour chaque commentateur ! #DarkMage
Hello, I’m dark (man) dad 😊It is literally AWESOME what you all are doing❤️My very best to AGDQ for your continued success Mohan Vodoor
I am someone who works with cancer patients and wanted to say thanks to GDQ and all the runners for organising such a great event and raising so much money.
Thank you GDQ team, keep doing what you do. Binding of Isaac hypeee
Fresh outta college and looking to make a difference in the fight against cancer when I make it to med school. Better start this journey off right by donating to my favorite yearly event.PS: Skate 4 when?
A big fan of Binding of Isaac. May all your rolls be high in damage and speed. All the best.
Hey all. Been a while since I've had a chance to donate, things have been pretty crazy in my life lately. Wish I could be there in-person with all of you, but alas. Best of luck to all the runners of AGDQ 2020 and here's hoping we break some more records this year. Putting this towards the co-op final boss in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.
Had to donate to emphasize that heartfelt donation from CovertMuffin. To all those out there you are seen, heard, and loved. 2020 will be our year!
Good Luck for your run Marcus though Zamiel is objectively better than you are :D
First time watching live and also first time donating and wanted to donate during one of my favourite games (Binding of Isaac). Good luck to all speedrunners involved in AGDQ, glad to see so many donations already going to such a good cause. Hopefully, there is eventually a cure to or a way to prevent cancer. Also looking forward to the Fallout speedrun.
So excited to see Isaac at another event! It is crazy after all these years the community is still going strong and the evolution of the game has been incredible to watch. Thank you Marcus and couch for showcasing this amazing run. Can't wait for the new content and many more years of Isaac runs to come. Happy 10 years GDQ!
Marcus, bo9 me (on unseeded). Zamiel, the Isaac bossfight in R+ is awesome.
Good luck to everyone at GDQ!
Iiiiiiiiisaaaaaaaac!
Hello AGDQ, long time viewer, first time donator! Perfect time to do it during my favourite game! Thanks to everyone who makes this event happen.I've been meaning to donate earlier than this but never got around to doing it. Now I feel more incentivized to donating since last year, in Febuary, my amazing mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even though she is now declared cancer free thanks to early detection, all of us in the family have been affected by her going through treatment and cancer is never a good time (except in this very game). I hope that the money I can spare can go towards saving lives in the same way my mother-in-law's was. Come on now stream, let's try to beat this disease together! Much love from Sweden! <3
Hi, I've been watching the show for a long time, but this year I have to donate during Isaac's run since a week ago I finally got 3 Million % after years playing this fabulous game.
Let's do this! 10 years of games done slightly faster than normal!
C'est un peu banal mais merci à vous pour cette initiative ! Bon courage pour ce marathon ! #YomiCeleste
Shout out to Marcus, really cool to see someone I'm familiar with representing a game that I've enjoyed watching friends destroy with speed on a daily basis. Take my energy for good mapping!
Binding of Isaac is my most played Steam game. Gonna enjoy that run. Thanks to all speedrunners, event crew, donators and everyone else that made GDQ what it is. Keep up the great work!
finally able to watch the isaac speedrun live with my wife. (she loves this game and finally got 1,000,001 percent). keep up the good work and lets end cancer
On continue à bourrer LFR ! GOGOGO #GDQup (Twitter : @Bunlan__G)

[FR] un gros merci a toute la communauté et a tous les bénévole de soutenir cet événement un grand merci a tout ceux qui ont fait les lots aussi :D des coeurs sur les commentateurs de QUALITEY et des ambianceurs de FOLY #TempeteDeSang
I had to donate during the game that introduced me to my husband. We met in a Twitch chat, he bought me this game to get my attention, and it worked!! We were married in July. We decided to name our daughter, who is due in March, Eve in honor of this game. Glad to see Issac back in a GDQ rotation. Good luck StoneAgeMarcus!!
Thank you 😊 for fighting against cancer.
Had to donate to say thanks to all the couch commentators this event, especially my dear friend Kasper on the Binding of Isaac couch. Here's to another great QDQ!
Spectateur de longue date, je n'avais pas la possibilité de contribuer, mais maintenant je peux enfin donner ma pierre à l'édifice et soutenir cet événement.Nous devons nous mobiliser contre le cancer, Bourrez les dons !#TempeteDivine
First time catching this live, always thought this was an amazing event for a great cause, thank you all for what you do.
Although I have played over 500 hours of Isaac, this is my first time watching a speedrun. Interesting new take on a very interesting game! Good luck Marcus!
Hey kasper just wondering, where’s the lvl 3 shiny wooloo?

#CoeurNoir
Love you GDQ
#CoeurNoir
Issac was my game of the decade. I kept coming back to it year after year. Thanks for introducing me to another version of my favorite game. Here's 10¢ for every death on my classic and Afterbirth+ save files.
Greetings from back couch. Good luck on the run, and may all your cards be Emperor. Donations to runners choice
thrilled to see isaac at a gdq. played countless hours and watched even more. good luck to the runner, and shout out to the NL community
Having fun watching Marcus play the Binding of Isaac. Good luck on the run. Go Blue!
Marcus and Daniel, keep up the great work! I'm so proud of both of you.
Wonderful run from Marcus, thank you for running this, and to Edmund for creating such a wonderful franchise. Many memories of trying to get all The Lost achievements on keyboard controls!
The first time I've ever "Had to donate for my favorite game". Congratulations on making me feel like a scrub with only a scant 750 hours between Isaac and Rebirth.
Hey Marcus! Not sure if you saw, but Michigan State crushed U of M today. Good luck on the run, and Go Green!
Thanks y'all
Thanks for showing off this fantastic game and the dedicated communities that have been inspired by it to this day! Here's hoping Krampus doesn't ruin any more Devil Deals.
So great to see an Isaac run at AGDQ! I used to be a semi-competent racer back in my youth and loved every minute of it. By day, I'm a graduate student studying particle physics, so that's a thing. Trust me, it's not as glamorous as it sounds.But in all seriousness, the Isaac racing community is the best there is, and I highly recommend everyone interested to give the game a shot. Best of luck to Marcus on the rest of the characters, go fast and don't die.Your salty friend, Goth.
I'm so glad to see this poggers game being run! Big shout out to my friend RakeDog who showed me this game recently, its a yes from me
Good luck Marcus and shout out to Zam and Kasper for the great commentary! You make the Isaac community proud.
So excited to have AGDQ back and so excited to donate for the first time!
Using this donation for my mom’s friend who is currently fighting breast cancer right now. Good luck to all the runners, thanks for fighting the good fight.
Digging the Michigan State gear. Good luck with the run and Go Green!
Finally get to catch a GDQ live, and happy to see issac as well. Hyyyypppeee!
Another year and another AGDQ, thank you to all the runners for this awesome time!

I'm intrigued as to how Sonic '06 can be broken further. Let's make it happen!
AGDQ has started! HUZZAH!!!
This donation goes to fund Greed's donation machine. Thanks for running my favorite game!
Cancer is one of the best trinkets in the game but not IRL. Thanks for running Binding of Isaac and fighting cancer!
GO GREEN!(I'm actually a Michigan fan but I appreciate a good rivalry 😁Good luck on the run!
Let's go! First donation of AGDQ 2020!
Sonic 06 is by far my favorite Sonic game, and Silver is probably my favorite character. I'm really excited to see a run of his story, let's get that donation incentive met!

Go Green!
I would have liked to give more if I could.I just lost my dad 2 day ago from cancer so it matters for me to help this cause.
This is my first year getting to watch agdq with my fiancé and I couldn't be happier sharing this event with her for the first time. Here's to Savannah I love you endlessly. Good luck to all the runners and let's kick dancers butt!

I spent so much time in the binding of isaac, I almost had to repeat junior year of college.
Hey guys! Huge Isaac fan here. So happy to finally see it back at GDQ. I actually am looking to get into speedrunning this game very soon, and I have about 1000 hours played in the game between a few platforms. I'm gonna do my best to be the best runner I can at this game. Good luck with the rest of your run Marcus! I hope I can make my way into the speedrunning community for this wonderful series in the near future!
Afterbirth+ was my second most played game on the Switch in 2019, during 903 total hours of playtime. Had to donate during a game that I've lost ridiculous hours of my life to.
Sonic 2006 in AGDQ? I can't wait to see just how much this game can be absolutely destroyed.
I wish the best to all of you <3
Thanks for the epic shoutout Zam <3

Spent most of high school playing the original Binding of Isaac, love the game to pieces, good luck on the final stages of the run!
First time donating, sadly missed the A Hat in Time race but still thrilled to be donating! Going towards the Sonic 06 run, because that game is wonderful to see broken open even more than usual.
AGDQ is my fav way to start off the new year! I had to donate during the binding of Isaac run on behalf of my friend Goliath, who has almost achieved 3 million percent. Keep up the great work!
Hello from backstage! Shout outs to Kasper and Marcus, hope to see more Isaac at future GDQs
Toss a coin to your Speed Runner, O' Valley of plenty!

I have read the above discussion and agreed that Isaac is cool
This is a killer run. Congrats GDQ! Keep up the wonderful work!

Hi Zam. Great job getting the racing+ mod ready for this awesome speedrun ;) Keep going! Greetings Wofsauge (Wof)
I've been waiting for an Isaac AGDQ for ages and I can't wait to see it come back again. I've clocked in over 500 hours and it's my favourite game of all time - it's nice to see it get the spotlight it deserves! Also, hi beehive!
woooo isaac
Thank you to AGDQ for doing so much to stop cancer. Here's a shoutout to my best friend Cartridgeblowers, you're kicking butt and we can't wait for you to marry us in a few months. Much Love
Donating to wish the Super Mario 3 runners best of luck. Here's hoping they are not grabbed by the Hand of Miyamoto. Also a shout out to one of my students who fought brain cancer at such a young age and has been cancer free since!
100 bucks for the D100
An awesome event, and the third year in a row I've donated. Keep pushing on, and keep blowing these games out of the water!
How much for the any% run with the wall of glitch?
For an amazing Binding of Isaac run!
Was going to save my donation for later in the marathon, but after that magnificent Isaac run, had to do it now. As someone who just last year lost one family member to cancer, and had another be diagnosed (although thanks to early detection, it looks like she'll be making it out fine), this event is even more important to me now than it ever was before. You guys are doing great work.
Cette run d'issac était parfaite GG au runner et GG au commentateur ! #CoeurBleu
SMB3 hype!!!
A quick shout out to Cartridgeblowers and that sweet sweet hosting voice! First of many donations, good luck runners!!
always love GDQ time. sad i missed most of isaac but i had to donate. Congrats on the 10 year anniversary and hope we can go another 10!
Frequent watcher of the VODs, but now I'm watching live for only the second time. Put this towards Sonic 06. Terrible game, but great speed game!
That was a fun and fabulous Isaac run!
First time I’ve been able to catch this live! Also on my Birthday no less! Here’s some money to prevent Cancer! Looking forward to the SMB3 race!
Hi Candace, thanks for making a wonderful event like AGDQ even better by being here with me. You make it so much better that it inspired me to write a poem. Roses are red - violets are blue - will you be - my player 2
It was cool to see Isaac back! You do awesome work!
This is for Nat, but not the thyroid that is trying to kill him. He's my favorite person who watches speedruns with me, and a A+ cat petter. You got this, buddy.
LONK
Go for door 3!
Day one of many. Need to spread out my donations, but it's been a fantasic show so far!
Awesome Binding of Isaac run. Great to see it back in the AGDQ line-up with an excellent runner and great commentary. Keep up the great work.
Watching the stream from work on the big screen TVs! Happy to donate finally! Much love to the community!
Honk?

Connor; sorry I didn't come over to watch this SMB3 run as a unit. I know what you're thinking, wouldn't it be easier if I just text directly. I leave on the edge Cons.

Thanks for running this game. Go Mitch! Good luck and thanks for supporting a great cause! Hi to my brother Joe watching on the stream!
Really happy to finally catch the stream live. Thanks to all the volunteers making this possible.
Good luck to all the runners today!
I remember watching AGDQ for the first time back in 2011. Back then i thought "wow, they are doing so much do help prevent cancer, i should do something too". Fast forward to 2020 and i became a doctor, specialising in oncology right now. I just want you guys to know, that these marathons are one of the reasons i decided to become an oncologist. Please accept this small amount as a symbol of my gratitude. Here is to the next 10 years with you guys. Greetings from Cyprus!
My aunt died earlier this year not from cancer, but from complications due to a weakened heart from chemo. I am so happy that my favorite form of entertainment can be used to help raise money to try and stop this from happening to others!Donation incentive towards "NotGroudon" for Kyogre's nickname in Pokemon Saphire for my kids
Thanks AGDQ for doing your part to make the world a better, more cancer free place.
Donating because Mario 3 and the runners are awesome. Though I watch Mitch a bit more, I'm cheering for stewie because he's a cool dude.
HOONK
Donating for Tetrisphere, my favorite Tetris game on any console, with some of the best video game music out there. Good luck to all the runners, and keep being awesome!
Bon courage pour la 1er nuit de marathon ! #DarkMage
Hard to pick my favorite Mario speed runs but it's hard to beat SMB3. Good luck to the runners on what's sure to be an epic race.
This is the first GDQ my girlfriend has seen and she's really excited watch the Super Mario race. She's been really getting into speedrunning and might pick up TMNT herself. Love ya Angela, hope you enjoy the rest of this stacked lineup for GDQ!
Keep fighting the noble fight, AGDQ.

Here to kick off a five dollar hype train. With such amazing viewership we're DEFINITELY not going to break $200,000 before the end of the zelda block. There's simply NO WAY a bunch of people are going to donate $5 to an awesome charity and more than double the donation total by the end of the block. Fast donors at a marathon about going fast? PSHHH. It'll NEVER happen. ;P
Hi everyone! I'm enjoying listening to the dulcet tones of Carti B's voice! Good luck to Mitch in his SMB3 run. Watch out for Barry! Shoutout to my Jabem and all the awesome gamers who are running or watching the games!

Donating as a tribute of the 4th year of meeting my now husband on twitch chat during AGDQ 2016. I love this community.
Been watching GDQ for over 8 years and this is the first time I am able to actually donate! Excited about this SMB3 run! Honk!
Riven and Myst III at AGDQ? How is this possible? As a fan of these games that don't get much attention today, this makes me immensely happy!
Swing your arms from side to side. Come on it's time to go do the Mario! Take one step and then again. Let's do the Mario all together now! Just like that.
Your donation is in another castle. Just kidding!
Quack
I started watching GDQ last year and I found a newfound love for speedrunning! Glad I managed to catch SMB3 and really excited to see Gymnast86 take on Skyward Sword later tonight. My mom passed from cancer almost 5 years ago so I'm happy to give a donation to such a good cause. Also, HONK!
What an amazing start to GDQ! Shout out to my hubby Sharife for first introducing me to speed running!
Its the semi-annual most wonderful time of the year. AGDQ is hype and I know it only gets better.
The run should be save, no poo in sight to stomp the console, good luck everybody
Hey friends, tina here - am I in time for the 100% all coin ships race?
Good luck on the runs!
Thx 4 the lulz
Happy 10 year GDQ! Love these games and watching the players supporting charity. Save the frames! Save the animals! Go Mitch!
I bet Mitchflowerpower is glad Grandpoobear isn't beside him to "encourage console glitches"
Go Haxor!
Go mitchflowerpower! Good luck on the run and here's to 10 years of GDQ!
Ahhh, spaghetti! A raviolli! Mamma mia~!
Took a week off work just to watch AGDQ. Loved most of the the runs over the runs (the ones I was awake for) and I can't wait for more to come. More to come over this week and Dark Master Sword is amazing.One question though, why isn't Sonic '06 with the other sonic games or part of the Awful Games Block? I mean don't we all know its reputation by now???
Wow, 10 years already huh? Here's to another amazing decade.Cancer has been a curse on my family for as long as I can remember, so I'm more than happy to donate to the PCF every year, especially in the name of what has become one of my greatest passions: speedrunning.Best of luck to all three racers. I hope to join you all on the SMB3 leaderboards sometime this year.
I am thrilled to be able to make my first donation to AGDQ. After discovering GDQ a couple years ago it quickly became my favorite gaming event, can't wait to see how high that donation counter can get this year!
SMB 3 was my grandma’s favorite game. She would stay up and I’d watch her play when I couldn’t sleep. We lost her to pancreatic cancer when I was 13. I’m donative for Catherine Harris & so other kids can keep their gamer grannies around. Kill cancer, save the animals.
Congrats to GDQ for 10 years! Racing the classics is a formula for a great run. May the best runner win!
Nouveau don cette année pour lutter contre ce fléau. Ces dernières années n'ont pas été simples pour certains de mes proches qui ont du lutter contre différents cancers.#MarioLight
Have to donate toward point-and-click adventure games! I already missed out on helping the Riven opera Easter egg, so here's some money to save Saavedro in Myst III: Exile. Brad Dourif's character deserves to be saved!
This is the first GDQ I've been able to watch with my dad, who sends his love out to his friends in the Kaizo community. I hope when I'm old enough I can come along to one in person!
All those rage resets and frustrating streams allnlead upnto this! Good luck to all the runners!
Pway my level
Happy 10th Anniversary GDQ!
*honking noises*
Evening esteemed guests. I am proud of everyone here for raising close to $90,000 so far. This SMB3 run is awesome so far and I hope it stays close. Put this money towards Sonic 06 out of morbid curiosity. Keep on grooving all and may Boss Bass go hungry.
Here is some money to save Chucky-- I mean, Grima Wormtongue-- I mean, Brad Dourif-- I mean, Saavedro!
Gotta go fast!
I'm at home sick with the flu, so thank you to all the GDQ staff, volunteers, and runners for making this all the more bearable. Let's go Mitch!
This is for our 12 year old niece Lorelai who just rang the bell on her 8 months of chemo treatments. It's foundations like this that made it possible for her to do so. Thanks to all the runners, donators, and behind the scenes staff (especially the IT people - we are the heart and soul of the backstage).
SMB3 is my favorite game and play of all time (even if I've never beaten it). Go Mootchfleurpour.
SMB3 speed run is a thing of beauty.
*HONK*Translation: Honk.
Here’s to the first Mario run of the new decade! If whoever’s in the lead when the announcer reads this wins, I’ll donate an extra $10. Congrats to GDQ and all its staff on an amazing decade!
Happy 10th anniversary!#MarioLight
YOU GUYS ROCK!! AND ALSO HONK!!!
Shout out to Marcus from the Binding of Isaac Run - much respect for flexing on the boss rush and Hush with the D100.
Boom boom shake shake shake the room kick, kick, kick, boom
Enjoying the Mario 3 race so far, never actually beat it as a child. Also looking forward to the Skyward Sword run later tonight.
For the first time since I've watched GDQ events, I'm in a financial position to be able to donate. I wanted to donate during the event of the person whose runs got me watching them in the first place. Good luck to Mitchflowerpower and all the runners! Save the frames, stop cancer!
Hello from the Czech Republic, you have a great atmosphere there, keep it up and good luck for the racers!
My 5 year old twins are putting this money toward a Thehaxor victory today!
All you need to do is push A.
Donating for a shout out to my lovely wife, Hayley!
towards longevity and the wisdom that comes of it
Love the SM3 100% runs as this was a major game from my childhood. Good luck runners!Donation to leave Saavedro, because if he'd spent ten minutes solving the puzzle that would have gotten him home instead of years plotting his overly complicated revenge plan, we could have avoided this whole mess.
I just lost the GAME
Hi AGDQ, happy 10th anniversary! We're staying up late to watch the SMB3 race, but if you can read our donation before our bedtime then our dad promises to match our donation. Keep up the great work.
Had to donate during a SMB run. First time I beat world 1 of SMB 3 I danced around the room, crazy to see how effortless they make it

Thrilled to be watching the SMB3 race, such good platforming! This year's AGDQ has more meaning for me than most. In November, I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. I'm happy to donate what I can to an organization that aims to make stories like mine more rare. Hoping to get the perler bead mushroom because I need a 1up.

First time donating, and so happy that I can give to such an amazing cause! Congrats on 10 years!!!
I've been watching GDQ live for years, and usually it's a great week off to relax and watch some great entertainment. But this year I've decided to "play along" with some Games Drawn Quick action and draw every game in the marathon. Here's $25 toward Sonic 2006 to make the marathon that bit longer... and give myself even more work!
My fiance and I have been watching GDQ since we first started dating. Now, 4 years later we are attending our first GDQ event and getting married in a month! Thanks for all the great memories!
I had to donate during Mario 3. What an amazing game! Thanks for all the hard work and let's goomba stomp cancer. :)
SMB3 is my favorite game of all time. Always love seeing it run in new ways at GDQ. Good luck to the runners. Bad luck to cancer!
LONK
Honk!
SONIC 06
I love SMB3 but I hate the levels that, like, move on their own. Whatever that's called.
This is my first GDQ watching at home since AGDQ 2018, but I'm enjoying watching some awesome speedruns with my newborn daughter. I'm putting my donation towards naming the Wingull in Pokémon Sapphire Marnie after her.Shoutouts to my friends in the Mario community in attendance! Go Haxor!
For Skyward Sword file name Lonk

Hi it's me the host. $25 in support of theHaxor. No hands this time! Is it... wrong for the host to play favorites?

Been watching for six years now, but I'm finally in a position I can donate! Thank you for making such a difference through games, and here's to another 10 years of going fast!
I heard something earlier about a choo-choo train, so i'll do my part as well as 4 others. Another $25 donation if the host can pronounce my name close enough!!

Donating for the awesome Mario Zone cross stitch; I'm a stitcher myself and SML2 was the first Mario game I got to the last level on.
I always love when GDQ comes around each year. Here's to a great SMB3 run and to a great GDQ!
The Bowser’s Navy level in SMB3 is in a lake of blood. If you look at the map, it’s shaped like a koopa skull. Happy swimming!
Watching AGDQ with my amazing wife, here's to a great event and cause!
I'm new to the speed running world, but I love it. And I love the GDQ events. I'm glad to donate to such an awesome cause. I hope to run a game at AGDQ myself someday!

I think this cause is a great one to contribute to, and it's awesome to get an interview with great people from the organization we're helping! Thanks for coming out and sharing with us! Money incentive goes to host's choice.

Just got home from the most incredible MAGfest, and what better way to decompress than to get cozy and watch GDQ. Best of luck to the runners, 100k HYPE!
I've watched GDQ for years and am excited to make it to another great marathon. Zelda games have been always my favorite, Skyward Sword close to the top. Here's to another amazing week. HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

There are no bad Zelda games. Here's to showing some love for one of the more, er, divisive entries in the series.
Here's to another excellent GDQ event and to many, many more. I hope to see the 20 year anniversary.
Hoping to win the N64 :) Loved watching GDQ the past decade, here's to another decade!
Could not just sit here and watch, had to get on the train... Here is a little something to help in the fight against cancer. 100k hype!!
I like turtles!.. herm.. I mean, trains! Choo Choo
Wanted to donate during Gym's run because he's great and I've never played Skyward Sword before. I've heard it's the "bad" Zelda and I'm excited for him to disprove that!
Thanks for hosting your 10 year anniversary in my hometown, Orlando, Florida! Keep up the GREAT work guys!
Been watching GDQ for years, but this year is the first time I'm in a position to be able to donate. NEVER stop GDQ, it's the best community on the internet. Save frames, stop cancer!! <3 <3

GDQ is the best! Thankful for everything this community does.

Bonne chance pour la suite :) . #ConseilDes4
$100,000 on the first day? Wow!

it's so cool to see how much this run has progressed since the last GDQ. props to gym for doing such an awesome job breaking this game. lets start a 5$ train to celebrate! HYPE!
Donating in memory of my grandfather who died from cancer not too long ago.
Looked at my total giving from 2019 a few days ago... and it only reached about a quarter of the 10%-of-income I was aiming for. Here's to contributing something significant, and not just enough to feel good about myself; here's to putting money somewhere more useful than my savings account.
A little donation for a good cause!Should I have the time for a stream of my own anytime soon, I will do another donation matching my ammount of max viewers ×2 (even though I usually don't have much ^^').Hope the last year can again be beaten witg the donations!
I love watching AGDQ with my dad! To all those involved, thank you for all you do!
Looking forward to seeing some amazing runs! Hyped for the Zelda runs!
10 years strong! Let's keep this moving!
Hi Fufu, Hi GDQ! Love you all
100k first day!
I love GDQ, I love KungFuFruitCup (and her rad hair), but most importantly, I love helping people in any way I can. My mother passed away from breast cancer in 1992, when I was 7, so I've always had a personal vendetta against that dreaded disease. Let's take cancer down together, everybody!
The 5 Dollar train is nice and all, but we know, that not everyone can donate. So here I cover some more people, just so that others don't have to feel bad.
Long time viewer first time donator. Love this event and watch both AGDQ and SGDQ every year.
Skyward Sword was the first Zelda game I beat and is one of my favorite games. Donating for Zelda, Wii Motion Plus, and for my mom who recently began her battle with cancer. Thanks GDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation!
Thyroid cancer survivor. keep the research going :)
Love the event. Love the cause. AGDQ community is amazing
Shout out to dancing guy. You're the best dancing guy.
Home sick with the flu, but gives me more time to watch the stream! My mom has survived cancer five times as of this September, had to donate to this great cause during a Zelda game!
First time tuning in live and excited to donate to such a great cause! Skyward Sword was one of my favorite games as a kid. I spent so many hours getting it to 100% on both normal and hero mode, so seeing it getting totally broken by Gymnast will make it all feel worth it.
Wow 100000 that’s a lot

I may not have been able to make it to this year's GDQ, but I'm more than happy to support the cause.
This donation is for all of the caregivers that support all of the people who are effected by cancer. It's such a difficult, and often selfless role, to make someone's battle through cancer a little bit easier. Thank you all for all that you do.Kick cancers booty before it starts!
Good luck on the run Gym, here's hoping you bring the final boss a...swift Demise.How could I donate without a delightful pun? Much love to you all at this wonderful event!

It's an honor to be donating money and prizes to another GDQ event. I just discovered speedrunning in 2017 and had to get involved. The community is incredible, and I cannot wait to see what AGDQ 2030 ends up being like. I bet it will be nothing like any of us can imagine right now. This is the first of several donations I'll be making this week, so until the next one... HONK!!!!!
In memory of my Dad, who taught me to play videogames
HONK
Been watching GDQ for most of the 10 years it’s been running, I often use it as an example in my classes for how you can make a difference with whatever your passion is. Gymnast is one of my favourite runners and I think he does an amazing job explaining his run as he goes. Always impressed.
Skyward Sword Hype!!
Longtme AGDQ fan who felt this cause hit closer to home recently as my mom, just before the holidays, was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer. this donation is for her and everyone else dealt a critical hit in life. thanks to all the speedrunners, staff and those who've donated to helping crush cancer.
Didn't want to donate a second time today, but the prices just made me spend more money. Now where should we put that money towards? How about... naming the character for the Fallout Anthology "Honk"? I honk this might be a honking good idea, honk. Good honk on the run, Gym!
Super happy to donate. Hoping for that Gold 64.
First time I've managed to catch a GDQ event live after coming across the youtube videos. I had to donate for an amazing event. Big shout out to all the organisers and the runners.
Hundo Honk Hype!

Love Skyward Sword! Good luck Gymnast
Jumping on the Honk train! As a game developer it warms my heart to see the immense good that games and gamers can bring to the world! Go get 'em Gymnast! HONK!

Long time watcher and finally glad I can catch GDQ live so I can donate. Donation goes to Loading...
Hello GDQ friends! So sad that I'm not able to attend in person, but I'll be watching from home as much as I can! Let's CRUSH the 3 mil from SGDQ!! Oh, and I almost forgot. I've been hearing a lot of honks and hype, but I also wanna hear a classic! And I think Waluigi does too! Do it with me!! WAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!
Honk!
Had to donate during a run of one of my favorite franchises! Legend of Zelda games mean so much to me, and it always amazes me how quickly these games can be beaten. Good luck, Gymnast! And don't forget to HONK!
Watching the marathon with my family, LOVING all these great runs! It's wild how much the SS run has sped up since we last saw it! Best of luck on the run Gymnast! Honk!
My best friend's dad was recently found to have leukemia but thanks to cutting edge treatment I'm happy to say he's on track to beating it completely! I've been donating to GDQ what I can for a few years now and I don't see myself stopping soon. Putting this towards the bonus Sonic 06 run, because that game is weirdly only playable when speedrunning and that's hilarious to me.
Honk!
HONK!
Hi Gymnast! I love your streams, and good luck on the run! Good luck with your RBMs and show us how it's done, Game Boy!
Skyward Sword is my favourite Zelda game, so here's my donation to watch the game get torn apart! Good Luck Gymnast! HONK!

Blue is the best color!(and the glass spirit stones are just about the prettiest things I've ever seen)
Chirp! (Or should I say Honk?) Skyward Sword is my favorite game, and my birthday is later this month. So perhaps I should consider this an early birthday gift?
Had to donate during one of my favourite games of all time! Can't wait to see it beat in under two and half hours!And can I get a HONK?
HONK is the new ORB

Loved the Mario bros 3 speed run race! Shoutout to the runners especially Stewie cartman for the swag run. Continue to run and looking forward to seeing you on stage more
Hey guys, it's your friendly neighborhood gamer here! I don't have much WISDOM on speedruns, but being able to do a run like this must take a lot of COURAGE. Remember to embrace the POWER within! Sorry, I won't TRI to FORCE any more puns into this donation. Super excited for this run, so good luck Gymnast!P.S. HOOOOOOOOONK!
I've been waiting for this run since it got accepted! watching the speedrun develop over this year has been a great time, and gymnast is an awesomely fun runner to watch. This donation goes to the sonic 06 bonus game, because it's the game that got me into speedrunning (and so in a roundabout way, legend of zelda too.)
WAGGLE TIME!
Hey guys! First time watching GDQ live! Thanks for all you guys do and let's have fun together. Honk!
Best wishes to the runner! HONK!
If I could get the couch to do their best impression of Link's grunt/scream I would be grateful. Thanks to all of the volunteers everybody working behind the scenes!

Hey y'all! Been watching these events for years and what y'all do is absolutely inspiring. My boyfriend and I always love snuggling up on the couch and watching our favorite games get 360 no-scoped for a great cause, so I had to donate during one of his personal favorites. Love you, Yellyfeesh; being with you is the greatest adventure of all.

I'm so excited to be here at my first GDQ to watch Gym run Skyward sword in person! This is the run I've been looking forward to the most.

It's time for a wonderful AGDQ again, and somehow I have most of the week off. So basically... time for my wallet to really start crying. Here's to a bunch of great runs for a wonderful cause.I've had fun looking at how quickly Gym and the others have gotten the Skyward Sword speedrun down over the past few months. Here's hoping it goes better with... oh boy he's keeping on dying what a shame (kidding 0ω0)

I don't have much to say, but its cool to play Breath of The Wild while watching Skyward Sword and the hero named Honk!
Great charity. Much of my family has faced cancer. Thanks for this.
A dear friend of mine is currently fighting cancer, which was unfortunately caught quite far along. It is my hope that through prevention and early detection one day no one else will ever have to go through this fight. Thank you GDQ for all that you do <3 Honk!
Zelda? Honking? Ah yes, it must finally be time for Untitled Groose Game.

Hi, Gymnast! Nice to see you running Skyward Sword here, and thanks for doing what you do! Also, honk, apparently.

After following AGDQ for years, I'm excited that I'm finally in a position to donate, ESPECIALLY during a Zelda game, probably my favorite franchise of all time. Good luck to all the runners, and thank you to everyone who has made this event possible!
Honks done QUACK T-shirt when?

So cool to see skyward sword at gdq once again! Good luck on the run!

My boyfriend is so hyped to watch this speedrun. Also HONK!
Been watching the youtube videos of the glitch hunt for a while, so glad to see you at AGDQ!

Hey Gym! Been watching you for a while. Good luck on your run! Been a long-time viewer of GDQ and I'm finally in a position where I can donate and help out! My best friend, my father, overcame esophageal cancer a few years back so this cause means a lot to me. It is SO amazing what this community does every year. I want to thank everyone that puts this awesome event together and all the runners/annoucers that give up their time to entertain us. Thank you to all the donators and the Prevent Cancer foundation. HONK!
Gonna keep donating until I get a big HONKING shout-out to my wife, Prumm! I love you!
Bad luck on the extending blow, but there's still Honk
Mess with the Honk you get the Lonk
This is a reminder to stay hydrated.
Congrats GDQ on a decade of speed-running! Though I do fear for everyone's safety as Gym is not using a wrist-strap with his Wii-mote.... Best of luck to all the runners!

Honk if you're Hylian!
Excited to donate for our first time to such an awesome cause! Even more excited to watch Skyward Sword get destroyed!! HOOOONK!!!
Hero mode... more like...HONK MODE. My husband thinks that this goose might be robbing people but hey, as long as it’s for charity. I have a proposition for twitch chat for our own hero mode speedrun, how about a quarter mil by midnight?? And why not do it in cacophonous chaos. The rules of this speedrun are simple. Just one dollar to honk, and use your monthly amazon prime twitch sub on GDQ to add another bell to the pile.HONK! MODE! HYPE!
Kikwis are the cutest!!! Also I like your shirt GYMNAST86! Thank you for running Skyward Sword!
I'm so exited to see Skyward Sword here and it's been a fantastic run so far. Can I get a HONK!
Good Luck to the runners!
Hey guys, hope ya'll are keeping hydrated! Thanks for putting this on each Winter/Summer, and for keeping the event going into 2020, a new decade! I watch for LoZ and classic games every year, so here's $10 for the last 10 years and $10 for the next 10 years! I shall not be honking - I'll instead say to "Save the Animals" because frames are for chumps!
Greatings from Sweden! Had do stay awake for the Zelda run with Gymnast!Shout out to Rhi and Chris who I hope are watching in LA! Hi Guys!(Hope this gets read out loud) :D
Some rupees are red,some Bokoblins are blue.This Skyward Sword speedrun is legendary,and so is AGDQ!Happy 10th Anniversary, AGDQ! And thanks to all who made this milestone possible. If we can beat these awesome games, then we can beat cancer.Honk!
Hey everyone had to donate when my man gymnast was running love the run love the event lets kick cancers butt!!! HONK!
Loving this run, it’s so amazing how half of it takes place on the main screen and makes no sense at all.
My favorite Zelda game of all time... Isn't in this marathon. But Skyward Sword is a solid 19th place, so it's good enough!
This run is insane, and Gymnast66 is showing so much skill with all of the file manipulation and skill in Skyward sword. I can't get enough of this run! Money goes to runner's choice.
Skyward sword is my least favourite Zelda game and I tune in to GDQ to watch you guys destroy it. HONK!
More like Untitled Groose Game. Honk!
It seems you guys have lofty goal preventing here's a donation to send your total donations skyward.
Honkward Hooooonk. Good honk Gymnast86! Everyone give me your best honk!
Less Honkers, more Bonkers!! LET'S GOOOO GYMNAST!!! #gymnast
Greetings from the back row! Always a fun time watching Gymnast waddling through Untitled Groose Game! Here's to another successful GDQ.HONK!
Keep on truckin'!
Having a blast so far at my first time in a GDQ event and been waiting for the first Zelda run since i arrived. Would like to wish Gymnast86 good luck in his run and to every other future runner. Stay awesome!!!
This is one of my favorite speedruns, and it's been great watching it drop time like crazy. Keep up the awesome work Gymnast, love your runs and your Youtube channel.

HEEAAAGH!!
With Honk dying in lava so much, I guess you could say....His goose was cooked
I've watched since around 2013 but this is the first time I've been able to donate. I LOVE GDQ; I love, and am fascinated by speedrunning. I hope to attend an event in person some day, as either a runner or viewer. Thank you for hosting this and supporting research, it's a fun way to help a serious problem; best wishes to all.
Hey, Gymnast! Breaking my sleep schedule a bit to watch your run here... no pressure *honks in sleep*
Hey gymnast86, great seeing you at agdq! Say hi to the other 85 gymnasts for me!
I'm super excited for the FFVIII run! Thank you guys for everything you do. Awesome cause.
HONK!
Hi there ! I know my girlfriend is watching this since this game in one of her favorite, can you juste say: "I love you SuperStephh" ? Thanks a lot !
Ah yes, my favorite time of the year. GDQ is always a good time. Sending love from New York!
#gymnast Hey Gym! You may want to pick up the pace a bit, you're an hour into the run and still on the title screen. All jokes aside, best of luck, and thanks to everyone who makes GDQ possible.
My very first GDQ donation. Getting it in on the first day, and I can't wait until we beat the record and hit 4mil. My very first HYPE!!!
Hey Gymnast, Woody & Paulinchen here... Good luck on the run and, if Ghirahonk blocks your way...don't honk -- just bonk! :-)
The first GDQ of the nw decade is here, and so far it's been azwesome! So here's my first donation of the decade, which I have decided to place during these Skyward Shenanigans! Looking forward to all the awesome runs this week, and let's at least make that three million mark again!
Salut les Kongs, bel effort sur le premier défi fr, on se laisse pas abattre ! Rendons hommage à la CGI à la française, fleuron du tournant à l'an 2000. Nous renommons le fichier de sauvegarde de Donkey Kong Country 3 DKTV. Merci encore à tous pour la présence, bon stream, gardez la pêche !
Hey, Focus here! Absolutely loving this Skyward Sword run and it’s been a blast being here for my first GDQ. My grandmother recently (who lives in the Orlando area) has unfortunately succumbed to brain cancer again, and doesn’t have a long prognosis. I’m fortunate to be in the presence of amazing speedrunners, commentators and staff; not to mention running here myself has been a lifelong dream. Good luck, Gym.
honk
Lots of love for running this classic Zelda game! May your stamina meter remain a quarter full and your hearts perpetually at two. Honk!
Sending out a S5 dono for this great cause. Pulling a late night of storyboard work and GDQ is getting me through it. Thank you all... And Honk!
There is no escape from the Honk. The Honk is eternal. Also, OOOORRRBBB.
First gdq donation. Lets go gamers!
Hello people from GDQ! Always have a fun time watching these events and I always love donating. Here’s to GDQ and it’s future. Also I needed to donate for Sonic 06 that’s gonna be fun as heck :3
Congratulations on 10 years of GDQ! Day 1 has been amazing and this Skyward Sword run is impressive! Go Gymnast! Honk!
super excited to see a skyward sword run! keep it up!
Had to donate during my all-time favorite franchise! Keep up the amazing runs and may the (tri)force be with you all!
Thank you runners, couch, and event organizers!
GDQ is like the All Star Game of video games. It showcases the most talented players doing their most impressive feats without it being about winning or losing: 100% fun. And as if that weren't enough, it fights cancer. Love it.
Looking forward to the Myst block!
Lonk HONK!
Hey AGDQ. I really appreciate this event when it's live, but also rewatch runs whenever I have panic attacks. Keep doing what you do, as AGDQ helps in a lot of people in more ways than one. If this event has helped you in anyway, then join me in a donation. Thanks again.
Hello GDQ! Ten whole years, and hopefully many to come. I love that an event I enjoy supports a cause I believe in. It’s been so fun watching Gym completely decimate this game over these past months, and the payoff is so sweet. Keep up the good work everyone! Donation goes to naming the character Zapp Brannigan in The Outer Worlds
Hey first time seeing agdq online but watched on youtube alot. Keep up the great work and dont stop what y'all do. Its awesome!
Can we change Skyward Sword's name to Mistitled Groose Game?
Seeing the evolution of Zelda file names at GDQ from Link to Lunk to Lonk, and now to Honk? I love it! Keep up the good work, and shoutouts to the staff behind the scenes!
Watching GDQ with some friends on our living room couch - hi Tim!
Hi, everyone! Long time GDQ fan here :) Keep up the amazing runs and be sure to save the animals!
Hey Gym! You're killin' the run so far, seriously impressive! Wanted to drop a donation from me and my girlfriend, who recently lost her mother to cancer last October. We hope this money can save even one person's life!
I have insider information regarding the sequel to Breath of the Wild.The new Zelda game will be called The Legend of Zelda: Hero of Noble Kleptomania. This iteration of Link will actually be a harmless bird who steals various items from the members of Ganondorf's regime and uses them to bring peace to Hyrule. We know this is a big change from the style of gameplay seen in Breath of the Wild, but we think it will be a welcome one.(read the next line out loud):Announcer, can you give me the best HONK you can muster? Only honk though; don't actually read this part out loud thanks
Hi Gym, I am your archenemy, good luck with your run! You failed the circles so donating to compensate yet again!
HONK!
Loving this SS run! I love informative runs, and this is the best of the best at that.
Best of luck to the runners! Getting in my donation before I pass out for the night. HONK!!!
We woke up at 3am to watch Gymnast HONK! his way through Skyward Sword. Greetings from Finland, congrats to AGDQ for 10 years of awesome speedruns! HONK HYPE!
This skyward sword run is awesome! It's making me look forward to the Zelda block later in the week. Specifically The Adventure of Honk! and A Honk! to the Past.
Hey Guys,lost my mother to cancer 4 years ago and I am just very thankfull for what you are doing. For everyone please rather get urself checked early than late. You guys are super entertaining, thanks for what you do!
I love watching AGDQ every time it comes around! So glad I logged on in time to catch these amazing runs. Good luck to all the runners! Oh, and HONK!!
Skyward Sword is the first game I ever owned, and Gymnast is the speedrunner who inspired me to learn how to speedrun in the first place! Great game, great runner, great event. Good luck with the run, Gymnast!

Strapped for cash, but lost a loved one over the holidays, so we definitely feel the need to donate. Been watching GDQ for years to brighten our days. Gymnast is one of our favorite runners and the Zelda series is the absolute best. Thank you all so much for doing what you do.
Thanks for all you do! This is an incredible organization and means even more to my since learning my dad was diagnosed with stage 2 prostate cancer. Luckily, due to early detection, it is treatable.
Today is my birthday and I couldn't think of a better way to spend it than watching AGDQ. Thank you to everyone who makes these events possible. Good luck to the runner.
Hey guys, I just donated during a loading screen, i want everyone in chat to donate $11 at 11:11 when i switch from file 1 to file 2 and lets fight this cancer 1 meme at a time
First time donating, glad to actually be on while this is happening
Every year I empty out my change jar and donate what's inside to AGDQ. Happy 10 years and here's to 10 more!
Thank you for the great content and for supporting such a worthy cause. Love what y’all do.
I've been watching these awesome events since 2011. I missed the summer event cos of work so here's something to compensate.
HUNK! Wait, no, that's not right...
GDQ knows how to make me smile. I really like the new phrase this year. What is it again? Oh yeah, HONK!
First time watching GDQ live instead of on YouTube after the event. Wanted to make sure I donated during Skyward Sword because I enjoy watching Gymnast86's speedruns. Good luck!
I'm pretty sure the Back In Time glitch was invented by the Goose. It's exactly the sort of thing the Goose would come up with. HONK!
I look forward to this event every time it comes around. Thanks for everything you do....... Oh why not, HONK!
Shoutouts to Ancient Cistern, the best dungeon in the worst Legend of Zelda game! :D (Just kidding, Zelda II is the worst.)
HONKING shout-out to my wife, Prumm! I love you!
You just have to donate during this awesome run. Donation to Runners choice!
This donation during Skyward Sword is for my friend Krys who had to deal with cancer striking personally in their life. While they may grump about Christmas gifts, I know they will appreciate seeing money going to this good cause! His gift can also be saving Saavedro, I hope!
HONK!
$5 train hype!
Made a new years resolution to go to the gym; so here I am watching his run! Best of luck!! Thanks for the great photo with Linkus!
They keep talking about going back in time, but I don't see any ocarinas? This run has been facinating, good luck to all runners this week! (HONK!)
Donating to say hi to my brother Dane, who is also watching. What's up bro?
The Legend of Zelda means so much to me, so getting to watch you all play while contributing to a great cause is the best! I love watching you all play, it's so chill and I feel like we're all in the same living room, just hanging out! Have a great GDQ, hype for HONK!
Love you Zach <3 for Nana.
Donating for my friend Tommy who just lost a loved one to cancer. Hoping that we can find a cure so that nobody will have to go through the pain of cancer.
Another GDQ, I'm so excited! I made sure to donate at least a little bit this year, as I lost two family members not too long ago to cancer. I hope to donate more before the event is over. Good luck and blessed RNG to all of the runners! Save those frames, and beat those games.
$5 train hype! Also, here's a random Zelda fact: Did you know that Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild and the Wii version of Twilight Princess are the only Zelda games in which Link is right-handed? In all other games he's a Lefty.
So close to unlocking Rescue 10-10 for Tetrisphere! Choo choo!
Attending GDQ last year was a memorable week for me, and I'm excited to see what this year is gonna bring. Happy 2020, here's 10 dollars for 10 years.
I've been watching GDQ for 8+ years. I have yet to miss one, and I try to watch as much as I can each time.I never thought it would happen, but recently my father was diagnosed with cancer. Despite the optimism of friends and family, nothing cheers me up like some good 'ol Zelda glitch runs during GDQ. Thank you, and GLHF!
Finally beat this game just this past summer after years of complaining about the controls. Not my favorite Zelda, but I'll double my money if the couch, the runner, the crowd, whoever, can give me their best rendition of the greatest song in the Zelda franchise: The Groose theme!
Shoutouts to all the people that can't afford to donate, but still take time out of their day to watch and appreciate everything this marathon stands for. We love you, plebs! ♥ Honk!
Honk
Did someone say honk train? Hooooonk!
Keep up the great work!
Absolutely had to give for the Myst runs!! Since the Riven incentive has already been met, I'm voting to save Saavedro in Exile. Give the man a break!
Bonk!? Or HONK!?
Shout out to one of the best 3D Zelda dungeon/boss combos: the Ancient Cistern and Koloktos.And of course...QUACK.....wait, I mean LONK.........I'm bad at this.
I've been watching AGDQ for the past 4 years and I've always loved watching speed runs of the games I've played all my life, really loving the Skyward Sword run, keep it up Gymnast! HOOOOOONK
Iron Gate Hype!!!
So excited to see how far this run has come! Good luck gym and hi to the couch!!
HONK!
Thanks to all the staff and runners for another great event! Happy 10th anniversary! HONK!
Thank you to all involved for the wonderful runs and helping PCF. Cancer took my best friend and tried to take family too, but my Grandmother is still alive due to early detection.
Good luck on your run, and by the way... HONK!
Fun Zelda Trivia! During development, Skyward Sword was tentatively called "Untitled Groose Game". Honk!
I was going to donate every time we heard a HONK but some goose in a green tunic stole my wallet, then warped back in time?
With all these honks I'd think this was Untitled Goose Game.
My mother is in the hospital right now due to cancer sadly. thanks for AGDQ and speedrunners for doing what they do.Also HONK!!!
Bless you all
This donation is dedicated to the memory of my friend Rook who passed on January 3rd. We miss you, we love you.
Tetrisphere doesn't get enough attention for how unique it is for tetris. Let's see FFR beat rescue 10-10
who says "who says "we have a $10 donation from "we have a $10 donation from"""
Despite what people say about Skyward Sword, I can still remember the summer I listened to the 25th-anniversary cd that followed with it on my cd player over and over again with good memories when I wasn't playing the game. Good luck with all the runs!
I was stoked for Myst when I got here and I'm even more stoked for it now! Pointing, clicking... It's like an adventure! Lots of fond memories playing this series with my mom as a kid. Best of luck to all the runners!
"Honk", the new "orb"? What a way to be. Good luck to all the runners this week. HONK!
I don't know what all the honking is about but my husband introduced me to GDQ AND Zelda and we are celebrating 10 years together! Go Gymnast86!!
Hello, first time donator, long time GDQ fan! I've loved this event for such a long time, and I love and appreciate all that you for charity! I'm watching the Skyward Sword run with my boyfriend this year and I couldn't be happier! Good luck and.... H O N K !!!!
Hey gymnast. Just wanted to thank you for a very informative and honking great time. Keep up the great work. You really quacked the crowed up.
All I wanted was just one HONKOne tiny little innocent HONKHow can you say that you don't give a HONKI find myself stupefied, going back in time
HONK
Having a blast watching gymnast play the Legend of Honk! Here's to making the bonus game incentive and helping the prevent cancer foundation.

I feel like the Zelda community missed an opportunity by calling it Back in Time instead of A Link to The Past. P.S. BROTHERS, THE HONKENING IS NEIGH!
Long-time watcher, first-time donator. I'd be a _goose_ not to donate to this excellent Skyward Sword run. All love to the runners and everyone working hard behind the scenes!

Been watching GDQ for many years now and am finally in a financial position to donate. It is so awesome what you guys do here at GDQ. It's so exciting to watch so many people of the speedrunning community getting together and raising so much money for such a good cause. So excited to watch so many amazing runners this week, good luck to all!!

Hello~!! or should I say HONK!!!!!!!!!This is my first year being able to catch a GDQ and so I decided to donate during one of my favorite Zelda games!
HONK
$10 per bonk in Skyward Sword. There's a Groose loose in the hoose. There is no honk, there is only...BOOOOOONK!
Excited to have GDQ back! Two of my good friends were diagnosed with rare cancers this fall, so I'm especially grateful for the event this year.The only question I have is: Has the untitled goose's HONK replaced my man Waluigi? If so, I can only say WAAAAAAAAAAAA!
HONK!!!!
Hello from Seattle! I'm giving my donation to saving Saavedro because I have a soft spot for the series' second-best villain. So glad to finally see this series run and I'm sorry I couldn't be there myself. Best of luck to Gelly, Zaustus, and Flapjack, and hello to all the other Myst runners watching right now.
Gymnast truly is the last jedi
Holy moly! Nice final boss blindfold kill!
Here's a donation for blindfolded honk.
Happy New Year everyone!

I love you all. <3Will give another $50 if Wolf can do the tank/t-rex section damageless!
Was planning on donating later in the event but HAD to start as soon as I saw the blindfolded demise fight, gymnast is a LEGEND!
Amazing runs!!!
Great Zelda run let's go Dino Crisis 2!!!
Usually 2.5 hour runs have less exciting parts, but the runner and couch kept things interesting the whole time. Great job! :D
I just want to say that was an amazing Skyward Sword run. I got Groose Bumps.
Great work everyone! I've always enjoyed these runs and for such a good cause. Hopefully I can attend in the future.

10 Years of AGDQ I'll donate and HONK HONK for that
Can't believe it's time for another GDQ. Excited for a week of fast runs and great commentary!
I'm glad that I can catch GDQ so early this year, and that I have the means to contribute! GDQ Hype!!
M
Premier don pour cette édition (loin d'être le dernier), bonne semaine tout le monde et bourrez les dons ! #Kyogre
Won't be around for Bomberman later, so I'm dropping this donation early. I'll be back tomorrow ;)
This is my first time watching GDQ in real time, and my first time donating. The Myst games have always had a special place in my heart, and I can't wait to see these speedruns!
Thank you all for your efforts for this charity. My father-in-law was a HUGE gamer even in his 70s, and we recently lost him to cancer. He and I both love the Myst series, and I'm excited to see those runs. Cyan Studios deserves all the kudos in the world, especially for getting so many people into games. Find the pages.
I've watched for the last couple years, and made a 16 hour drive to make the decade year!! Lost my mother and grandfather to Cancer and hope we can beat Cancer as well as these runners are beating these games!! Greetings from the front row!!
AGDQ is amazing! Gotta go fast!
Thanks to everyone who makes these events possible. Amazing Skyward Sword run, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the week! Honk!
Myst is one of my favorite game series that I never beat when I was a child because I didn't have enough patience or understanding to play puzzle games. I need to go back and try again now that I have a better of idea where even to begin with them. Good luck and Go fast! Myst Hype!

Saavedro does not deserve to be left in anguish.
Un petit don avant de partir au boulot, courage à ceux qui doivent ce lever tôt et merci au commentateur qui nous accompagne jusque tard le soir ! #DVVol2
A small donation in honor of my Uncle Bill, who passed away earlier today after a long, hard-fought battle with cancer. I'm looking forward to a time where no one has to fear losing someone to cancer again. Love you, Uncle Bill!
My mother is currently lying in hospice due to cancer. She is expected to die within the next two weeks. Hopefully, we can prevent anyone else from suffering the ravages of this horrible disease. This donation is in honor of her.
Shout out to my older brother KujakuDM. He survived his battle with cancer when we were both younger. I’ll never forget visiting him in the hospital and watching him play one of his favorite games. Dino Crisis 2. Love ya Ken.
Hail Prevent Cancer Foundation! Hail GDQ for making this possible! Hail everyone that has donated towards this great event! Let us destroy cancer in our lifetime!
Myst at GDQ taking "it's not a spoiler you've had so many years to play it" to a whole new level
I am terrible at comments. So pretend I said something funny related to geese. Also, Hi Chris.
Hi to Deo in the audience! Love Charlie and Mommy from upstairs

Long time watcher, finally able to be here in person. Here's hoping GDQ's 10th anniversary can break last summer's record.
Donating $79.93, the price of the Myst 25th Anniversary Collection, since I was so excited that I could finally purchase Myst 4. I went right to steam and bought it as soon as it was mentioned on stream. Donating to leave Saavedro since I can't bring myself to do it when I play

Shout out to WolfDNC and the couch. The Baby belongs to my drummer and I have an ear infection, I pray for raptors to eat me. My life, Waifu. My life.
No no no no no no no
Some would say that Monster Hunter is the spiritual successor to Dino Crisis
Just like when a puppy steals your shoe... so you chase it around with a shotgun.
You are cheating
Hek hek hek richmon, love from Johnny 5 Aces
I watch this all the time and my wife made me do this. Good luck to all the runners!
Hello from Brazil... Keep the awesome work guys!!
Dinosaurs? Rex please.Been watching GDQ for years and I can't pass up the chance to donate during a crisis involving dinosaurs.
Oh wow. Resident Evi-- I mean Resident Crisi-- I mean Dino Crisis 2!Make sure to pet the velociraptors!Good luck on the run wolfdmc!
My First GDQ and my first Donation, I use to play a lot of survivals as a child, I have fond memories of playing Dino Crisis 2 in Coop with my cousin, he played as Dylan and me as Regina. now that we are on our thirties, we would love another amazing remake as RE2 and RE3, but with dinos, You can do it Capcom
Do you know how dinosaurs pay their bills in this game? They use Tyrannosaurus cheques.
My friends 2 year old nephew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and he loves dinosaurs. This event is truly a blessing. And all the staff that make it happen are making lives better with all their work. Let's all work together to make cancer extinct just like the dinosaurs in dinosaurs crisis 2.
Very considerate of the velociraptors to let you climb ladders without attacking--if only all dinosaurs were so polite. Second year watching GDQ, and I'm very excited to see all the cool games and their awesome runners. Dino hype!
Hey everyone! Have fun at AGDQ! Good luck on the run, Wolf!
These dinos don't seem to have a chance. Hopefully neither does cancer.
Have you heard of the place called G D Q,out in the land of red, white & blue?Year after year I keep going back,to abandon all duties, to lose all track.It's much too speedy, too quick, too fast!Open my eyes, a week has passed!I sit on my bed, stare at the floor,well that's never happened before!(That's a lie though, it's happened f o u r t e e n times for me already, ever since AGDQ 2013! Cheers from Finland!)
Good luck with the Dino run, WolfDNC. Beware of those grabby Bois.
I said I would donate as soon as I got home and I meant it, here's to the first of hopefully many donations this agdq
Wolf, when are we training again?
I have fond memories of gunning down those plesiosaurs, can't believe that was 20 years ago. Shout outs to my brother Miguel who I used to play this game with as a kid, and to my dad who is winning his own battle with cancer.
Dino crisis? You could solve that with a bit of dinoMITE
How can I not donate during one of my all time favorite series!?!? Dinosaurs and ANOTHER Third Energy disaster? DC Remake when Capcom?!?!?! Good luck to WolfDNC!!
I lost both my mum and my nan this year, my mum having gotten me into video games since before I can remember. I couldn't not donate during Dino Crisis, as when I was little I would constantly beg my mum to give me a go but never leave the first room for fear of the raptors, but even when mum took the controller again I would run out the room before I saw anything else. Keep up the great work!
What do you call a terrible, horrible, unpleasant dinosaur? A thesaurus!
If we're being honest here: I dinosaur is actually just a bigger, slightly less threatening goose. HONK!
loving the event, keep up the great runs. Hype? Orb? Honk!?
Yo but is that WolfDNC tho?!
Came home from job ,saw twitch tv trening dino crisis 2 ,in so proud that you guys run this game ,First played it in 2002 when i was 6 ,me and my dad loved this game ,seeing you play brought me to tears ! Huge shout to the couch !!!! Good luck with the run!!!
Been watching for years. 1st time donating! Shout out to WOLF and this dope DC2 run! Will Capcom give us the DC 1 Remake in 2020? Or maybe DC1&2!!!? Ohh and Save Brad Dourif!
Wish I was there in person, maybe next time. Good luck Wolf, you're making this game look easy! Let's beat cancer!
WAIT! Shoot AND run? *Facepalm*

Can't start a 3.50 train for the Loch Ness monster so how about 5 dollars?
I wanted to send in a pun but I dino I can't think of one.

Have y'all played Dino Existential Crisis? It's good! You have to keep a middle aged dinosaur from having a heart attack whole he reads a newspaper article about a meteor that Dino scientists think it's probably not a that...
Please no Aquacure... oh wait, wrong game! Good luck with the dinos!
I've been watching GDQ for years now and am finally donating. Here's to leaving Saavedro to die.
VERY DANGER! :O

This is in response to the derogatory comments about a Thesaurus. Thesauri are great! Best of luck to the runners, and the Prevent Cancer Foundation. I have terminal cancer myself and I hope this donation helps to save someone else in the future. Live like there's no tomorrow!
Fo'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayz (Really draw it out)
This is my favorite Jurassic Park game.
Bye Todd.

Four years into my vertebrate paleontology degree and here to tell you that birds are the last living dinosaurs, which means technically, Untitled Goose Game is a spiritual sequel to Dino Crisis. Thanks for doing what you do, save the animals, and... save a few dinosaurs for me to study, please!!
First donation this event, doubt it will be the last. Lets tyrannosaurus reck cancer.
Good luck my dude.
Go to bed son. eat your vegetables
I don't know anything about this game and am new to watching speed runs in general, but I love what GDQ does. Cancer has affected my family over and over, and it warms my heart to see people donating to this cause. Wish I could donate more, but sadly, this is all I can do for now. Good luck to all the runners during AGDQ!
do you also accept dinosaur jokes? what sound does one hand clapping make? - ask from t-rexalso: clap once if you liked it
Alright you didn't get the tank fight, but I'll give you the 50 for that Gigantosaurus 1 fight.Think you can do it again Wolf? Nother 50 with your name on it.
Dino puns? What do you call dinner on an airplane? Fly and dine. No, soar and dine.

Excited to see a Myst block at AGDQ! Failing the end puzzle and having Saavedro leave you isn't an option, so I guess I'll put this money towards saving Saavedro.
Loving this Dino Crisis run!Jurassic HONK!
Thanks for all the hard work for a great cause. Shout out to the late night crew!
Absolutely love Dino Crisis and what GDQ stands for. Keep up the amazing work, everyone involved. Honk.

THE SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED. ALL PERSONNEL EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.
Huge fan of the Myst series and excited for the Myst block, even if the games aren't typical speedrun material. Donating to save Saavedro, because Brad Dourif deserves to share in the best ending.
Is Atrus the worst video game dad ever? Maybe try spending some time with your kids before eternally imprisoning them in books. Just sayin’...GDQs are my favorite two weeks of the year. Here’s to ten more years of community, philanthropy, and fun. Words don’t capture my admiration for the work y’all do: Honk!!
I would love to say I beat Myst without a walkthrough but needed help when I didn't know I had to STRIKE the match before lighting the furnace. Consider this a protip for the run. HONK!!!
Huge fan of both point-and-clicks and GDQ, hyped to catch these runs in person for the first time. Greetings from the audience.
Stayed up passed my bedtime just to witness the Myst trilogy. Donating toward letting poor Saavedro go home to his family after all these years.
As Gehn might say,"I am Gehn. Perhaps you've--hey, where are you going?""The only path open to you now is through this donation. Take it."Wanted to get in a Gehn joke in this block before I *Myst* my opportunity. Have a great run and save the Saavedros! [pronounced: sah-VAY-droh(z)]
Catherine, my love, I have to leave quickly. Something has happened. They've entered the adventures of our quiet friend into Games Done Quick! I must make a donation while I can. Oh, and erase this message after you read it. That goose seems to be following me everywhere, and I don't want it to know where I've gone.
**Please read during the Riven run by Zaustus if possible!** Hype for Gelly, Zaustus, and Admiral Flapjack from Stryk, Narameh, and all of us in the RockPunch discord! Zaustus you've been such a great presence with all of us, and we believe in you! Best of luck to all of you, and donation goes to Zaustus's choice!
this is my first time watch AGDQ live my father has a Intestinal cancer for 3 years now and this year he just begin to do a chemotherapy. I hope my 5$ will be able to help other people that have cancer problems :D
The Myst trilogy was a big part of my childhood. The games are a bit of an odd choice for a speedrun, but I'm excited to see them on the big screen regardless. Don't let those pages fall into the wrong hands (or beaks)!
When I was a kid, my parents were in the ‘video games rot your brain’ camp. Myst was one of the only titles I was allowed to play, so this series will always have a special place in my heart. I’m thrilled to see a favorite getting so much love during one of my favorite weeks of the year. Games Done Quick is one of the things that makes me proud to say that I am a gamer, and I’m so excited for what the next ten years have in store. Hype and honk to all!
Honk
In the last two years, my dog, future mother-in-law, and close co-worker were all diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately they all managed to beat it, thanks in no small part to organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation who are working to bring an end to such a horrible disease. Plus, I HAD to donate during the Myst block - without a doubt the best game TRILOGY of all time. Thanks to all the runners and volunteers for putting on another wonderful event!
Stayed up late to watch Myst block with my Mom, have to donate for it. Can we get a hype 'Honk' from the audience?
How cool is it that we're seeing classic graphic adventures at a GDQ?! It calls to mind SGDQ2012, when Mr. K did his epic run of SimCity.Yes, I know how that sounds!
LETS GO
Never thought I'd see the Myst series at GDQ. Great event, great cause, and it's up to all of us to make sure that, as far as GDQ is concerned, the ending has not yet been written.
Saavedro? More like SAVEdro, amirite?
Grew up playing the Myst games, Exile even being my favorite, so I had to donate for this block
Bring me green pages....I mean donate green dollars!
What do I put here. I guess.... HONK?
Ah, my friend! You've returned – we meet face-to-face. And the page, did you bring the page? … [Sighs] You didn't bring the page. You didn't bring the page! What kind of fool are you?
Thanks for the hours of entertainment. Let's kick cancer's butt!
To try and end the horror of cancer, from a survivor
Last time I saw this much myst I was in the sauna you know what I'm sayin'?Pour one out for the killed animals. Biblethump FrankerZ
Myst was the first "big kid" video game I finished all by myself and is still one my favorite games to this day. I'm absolutely delighted to see not just it but a whole Myst block at AGDQ!
<Atrus_voice>I realized the moment I clicked the "submit" button, that my donation would not buy me a pizza as I'd (originally) planned. It continued traveling across that digital expanse, for an event at which I had only a fleeting glimpse.I've tried to pontificate on where my donation ended up - I must admit, however, that preventing cancer is worthwhile. Still, rumors about how fast these runners can go, are kinda exciting to me.I know the friendly animals might never be saved, and so I close - realizing that, perhaps, last year's record might yet be broken.</Atrus_voice>
Just got back from work, what did I Myst?
first game i ever played was The Secret of Monkey Island, but i have a hell of a soft spot for Myst as well.
LOVED WATCHING DINOS GETTING PUT TO SLEEP, SLEEP SLUGS FOR THE WIN. HONK.
Shoutout to the late-night crowd!
Long time watcher, first time donator. The first game series I ever played was the Myst series. I spent HOURS going through all the CDs for Riven. I'm so excited to see these games played at AGDQ this year. This cause means a lot to me as my aunt passed away from Breast Cancer. Thank you to all the runners and volunteers.
A SEABIRD CALLS.THE UNKNOWING ONE STANDS AT THE RAIL.PEACE. THE CIRCLE CLOSED.THE LAST WORD WRITTEN.
Just here for the N64
I played my first point and click - Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis - before I could even read. I guess it was a challenge run? I've been hooked on them ever since. Excited for the Myst runs.
I had to donate during the Myst block. It was my first point and click and will always have the softest spot in my heart. Props to the runners. Money goes to reuniting Saavedro with his family!
Had to sneak a donation in here for my Dad and all the hours we spent playing Myst and Riven together when I was a kid.
Myst has a real special place in my heart, I was a bit young when they came out but my mom played them and I would sit next to her or in her lap and help by taking "notes." Good luck to the runners!
Thank you for the wonderful event. Greedings from Germany
I have loved the Myst series since I was a little boy and Riven has consistently been a game I've gone back to because of it's amazing world and music and mystery. can't wait to see these games speed ran. thanks for all you do gdq. hi Ingrid
Donating for the Myst runs, I still remember playing Myst as a kid and it blowing me away as something completely different than what I'd seen in games before, even if I didn't beat it until many years later, it still left a big impact.
Loooooooove Myst! Can’t wait to see a game that took what felt 30 years to beat get obliterated! Go AGDQ! Can’t wait to break more records!
Stayed up to donate during the Myst runs. The puzzles in Myst stumped me back in the day, but growing up I still loved the adventure game genre. Shout out especially to the Monkey Island, Sam and Max, and Gabriel Knight games! HONK!
First time GDQ viewer here! As an avid fan of videogames my whole life, I'd always been aware of speedrunning, but never knew until about a year ago truly what an awesome community there was. Ever since then, I've been captivated by the amount of skill, practice, and research that goes into these runs. For my first donation, it had to be during the Myst block, some of my favorite games of all time! Thanks to everyone involved for doing great things for a great cause. MYST HONK!! I mean, MYST HYPE!!
I watched my dad play these myst games years ago when i got to frustrated with the puzzles to do it myself. definitely a fond childhood memory and i can't wait to see these awesome games done quick. keep up the good work and shout out to the late night crowd keeping up the hype.
Hi from the second row!! I've got work on the other side of the state tomorrow, but these are my absolute favourite games. I couldn't miss these, even if I end up asleep at work tomorrow!
What a blast from the past. Shout out to Kalmineus. so sorry you MYST this GDQ <3
So many great runs already and it's only the first day, but I had to donate for Myst block! It can't be missed!
Hype for the hat that dances.
Shoutout to my fellow Night Workers, passing the time during long shifts the best way we can - with speedruns and charity donations! Looking forwards to this Myst trilogy!
Speaking of Lucasarts point and click games. You have to mention "The Dig". Keep up the good work y'all.
Shoutouts to Gehn. Also, are the golden domes in Riven domes... or are they orbs...?
Myst was one of the first games I ever played. I'm super excited to see the game that took 7 year old me weeks done is 15 minutes.
Just finished my first play through of realMyst today, can’t wait to see you totally destroy it!
Fight cancer!
Excited for this Myst block. Grew up on on point and clicks in the 90s. Shout out to The 7th Guest. Honk.
I never thought I would see a myst game played at GDQ, so it is incredible to see three of them being ran here today. The whole myst series has a special place in my heart, and im so happy to see them being ran today.
Been lurking for years while in grad school. Finally have a professor job and enough income to donate. Love GDQ so much.
Myst is one of the first computer games I ever played with my brother, I could never get through the puzzles by myself, but he always helped me through them. Can't believe it's been 10 years. Thank you for what you do!
I enjoyed Myst (games and books) but loved 7th Guest and 11th Hour!
I literally gave a presentation in college on the importance of Myst in video game and PC hardware history. Excited to watch a whole block of Myst games get the love and attention they deserve.
So glad to have you while I can't sleep :) Keep up the good work <3
It's amazing to hear that the Myst games are showing up at AGDQ! But, man, save Saavedro. No one left picking up the pieces after Sirrus and Achenar's library rampage should have that last shred of hope torn from them. Although, be sure to bring Achenar all the blue pages. He seems an all right dude, right?
Myst was one of the first PC games I ever played, and I've been in love with the series for 25 years. Super pumped to see a Myst block this year. Thanks to all of the runners, staff, and volunteers for everything you do. Cancer has directly impacted my family multiple times over the past few years, and it's encouraging to see so much going towards fighting this horrible disease. Save the Saavedros!
Love y'all down at GDQ, keep it up and am excited for this year! It's gonna be honking great!
Staying up late for Myst...
AGDQ is the best thing to watch on a Monday morning after not much sleep. You make my morning a lot less horrible! Especially with the Myst games. Love these since I'm a kid!
PowerPoint, er... I mean MYST block!? What the honk!?
So glad to see the first game I ever got obsessed with on the AGDQ stage. And shout out to the kid in second grade who told me about page 158.
Myst has a special place in my heart, such amazing memories playing it with my mom, as well as reading the 3 books that tell the backstory. Super excited to see what a speedrun looks like!And cheers to one of my top 3 favorite hosts - The dulcet tones of Prolix!
big hype for the Myst block, played with my dad as a kid. always makes me feel good. =]
Saavedro cannot be trusted
Oh gamers! Don't you dare be peeved! Clap for your favorite runners and feel the speed! It's Games Done Quick, yes it is!
I thought GDQ was about killing the animals? Saavedro's gotta die.
BRING ME THE RED PAGES
I first watched my brother play all of the #MYSTseries and have always been intrigued by the story. Good luck on the speedruns guys!
Love gdq! Let's beat cancer! Hype!
I only recently got into the Myst games last year and I have been loving them ever since. Well except for maybe Myst V, but we don't talk about that one...
Good luck on the run, win for Robin who is sick in bed watching!
Cure Cancer!
Gotta save Saavedro. Gotta make this decade about being the good guy.
Welp, it's January 6th now, and that means I just turned 40. And I'm staying up past my bedtime to feel old watching Myst speedruns while dreaming HyperCard dreams. Here's one dollar for each year to my name. Congrats on a great first day, and here's to an awesome week.
Happy New & Happy AGDQThank you GDQ for these incredible events and big up to LFR for their jobBonne année et joyeux AGDQMerci GDQ pour ces moments formidables et une ovation pour le boulot du LFR#GDQup
The Myst series is my favorite video game of all time! Gotta admit I don't like Saavedro. He almost killed Atrus and Catherine!
Saavedro is not to blame for his actions, he is victim of past atrocity. Do what is right and rectify the past!
This game is a...Myst play
Seeing all these Myst games being ran is gonna make me all Mysty eyed.
Realmyst, riven, myst 3, arbor mist, Sierra mist. Hype!!
Is it me or is it misty in here? Shoutout to everyone in the Board Game Room! Much love <3
Hello there from Hungary! Today is my birthday and watching AGDQ live is the best birthday gift ever! Sending out love to everyone out there! HYPE!
Go Gelly! Best of luck Walma7Love
First time watcher and I'm enjoying the excellent content
Please let me out of this book.Also hello to my husband who is in the crowd RIGHT NOW, I hope you're having an awesome time!
So excited for Myst block.... I have beaten all three games being run. Myst III was the easiest, and also the longest, because I didn't have the resolution to see the solution for the FINAL PUZZLE!!!! I finally looked up the answer one year later after not being able to figure it out!
Donating to Leave Saavedro. He's seems to shifty to save
Can't wait for these next three runs, I wouldn't Myst them for the world! It sounds like the runners are really dRiven to go as fast as they can... Its Exile-rating!
Looking forward to the Myst block. These are some of my favorite games and I am happy to see them at AGDQ. Save Saavedro. He has been through a lot and he deserves a break.
HONK!! Myst and Riven were some of the first games I played, and I found them hella confusing and didn't really know what I was doing. Looking forward to seeing them speed run, and still being confused about what's going on!
Your noclip is augmented, nice run.
How could I Myst my favorite game as a child. Here's hype for the Myst block.
Donating for that adorable Bomber Man plush. Thanks so much for the prevent cancer foundation, mother was able to take care of early onset skin cancer on her face and after 5 months she's made a full recovery! Always enjoy watching these events and brings back memories of when I actually had time to play video games!
I'm glad to see my favourite game series here :)Good luck to Gelly.
Wooooooooosh
I love the idea of taking a genre meant to be thoughtful, time-consuming, unhurried and speedrunning it! Also, who can say no to Brad Dourif?
My girlfriend and I played this game together to test the strength of our relationship. I'm now single.
Love Myst, but I can't watch the Riven or Exile runs because I haven't finished them yet! Good luck to the runners.
Sure, it's late at night, but I couldn't Myst this run! Good luck runners!
I haven't played this game for years, I've really myst it
What, is the run over already? I can't believe I mist that.
The first time you play this game is a bit *Myst-ifying*. ba dum tss. >:D♥
Knock knock. Whose there? Myst. Myst who? Aww, I missed you too AGDQ!
It's cool to see Gelly really BOOK IT through this game.
wait.... is this not the silent hill block? because it seems awfully MYSTy in here right now
Not a Myst joke but it still a good one.Frankenstein enters a bodybuilding competition and finds he has seriously misunderstood the objective.
Shorah all! I’ve CHOsen to donate aGEHN during my favorite video game of all time, Riven, so here's five fives. If you’ve ever wondered what an educational game for cultural anthropologists would look like, well, here it is. I think it is a real MYSTerpiece!The Prevent Cancer Foundation D’needs our generosity, and with your help perhaps the ending will not be written for the lives of many strangers. Let’s LINK together to EXILE cancer!Good luck Zaustus! Here’s hoping the game WAHRKS until the end. It’s not exactly... ATRUS-ty speedrun.
here is my pinball money for this weekend as i forgot about agdq.... sadly
Donating for the pin set
Atrus, I'm trying to solve these puzzlesbut I'm D'ni thickand the flapping of my pages keeps alerting Ghen!Good luck from the Court of Hearts, Zaustus!
Hey Brossentia!Okay, I know Brossentia isn't up right now, but still...I tried to catch fog, but I...Myst!
Happy Birthday Jason! So glad we were able to come experience our first GDQ together. We’ve “myst” you!
hot take: the best modern Myst game is Outer Wilds
Y'ALL RIVEN FOR MYST?
Simply aMazed by that Myst run! Shout out to seeing more of these point and clicks at gdq in the future!
Saavedro did nothing wrong. Well, mostly nothing.
Shoutout to my childhood friend, [insert goose here], who would come over to my house with Myst III Exile to watch me play the game on my computer for hours. I'm sure he was bored every minute. Thanks, bro.
Been enjoying the day watching these great games. My poor wife is suffering from the flu so she's watching herself. Shout out a get well soon cristen from Prolix?
(if read on air, alias is pronounced "Zen - fear - uh"). My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful time playing Myst together, it's great to see these guys on GDQ playing it real quick! He's asleep, so I guess I'll have to tell him in the morning that he "Myst" the speedrun!
Shorah, GDQ! Riven is the best game ever made. Excited to see the Myst series at this event! Save Saavedro...for the whark gallows!
MYST PUN TIME: I used to be a Maker like Atrus, but then I took an arrow in D'ni.
If Myst was that good, this run should be Riven-ting!
Myst was so formative for me I am absolutely delighted to see it on AGDQ! Though watching someone beat a game in 45 seconds that took me a over year is a little crushing.Anyways Shorah everyone, and shoutout to my my Myst-y friends Lynne and E4. Don't forget: The doors linking books open don't close behind you.
So glad to see the Myst games at AGDQ! Shout out to Kalmenius, good luck to the runners, and don’t forget to lock that door!
It would be a Myst-ake to Myst the Myst block. The Myst-ery of the fate of Saavedro will keep me awake, but something is Amyst in this world. I'm no Myst-er know-it-all but I know this Myst Marathon needs more puns.
First time attending, and staying up way too late to watch the Myst trilogy. Shoutouts to the Scorbunny hat up front.
Had I missed MYST, I would have been quite miffed.
Love y'all! <3
Loving the block! Realhonk: Mastergeese Edition, Ribbon: Sequel to Honk, and Honk 3: Eggs Isle were some of my favorites as a wee little gosling.
Mysty-eyed shoutout to my dear friends The Leaf Squad! Excited to have one of my favorite games hosted my one of my favorite GDQ voices. Hi Prolix! Gimme your best HONK for $25 more!
I always look forward to AGDQ to kickoff the year--congrats on 10 years and here's to a decade more! Save the frames and let's kill that cancer.
I used to play Riven as a wee nipper, and have good memories; even had a friend who play tested for Cyan, so here's another 25 for the memories.HONK!
hope the riven dome combo is "1 2 3 4 5"
Riven! Oh how I *MYST* this game!The puzzles never *CLICKED* with me when I was a kid...I wish I could have *BOOKED* a seat at AGDQ for this!Time for a *RIVE(N)-ting* adventure~!I was going to give these puns as anonymous, but I didn't want to be too *MYST-erious*!I'll be back with more~!
Honk!
Please read mine, please read mine, please read mine (just in cause you read mine, yay!!) HONK!!!!
I missed dino crisis, I am crazy mad. I'm going to donate anyway for my favourite game!
Myst was one of my first games. Great to see it at GDQ. Excited to watch yet another great week of speedrunning. Good luck runners!
**PLEASE READ DURING MYST III**I've known you for years, introduced you to your wife, I've even been in your house and cooked you dinner, and this is how you repay me? By being an amazing speedrunner AND raising money for a charity that means a whole lot to me personally? How so very dare you!Congrats on making it to AGDQ, Flapjack, Proud of you, my boy! Donation goes to runner's choice, as long as it's cool.Also, I never do this anymore so I gotta do it now - FLAPJACK SENPAI HYPE!
I love the Myst series, one day I might actually finish one of them... good luck on the runs everyone!
Great memories with the Myst block. Loved how the games fit with the books. Thanks GDQ for the good times.
Can you ask the runner to play a game and not a slideshow? I just myst what he just did.
I grew up watching my mum play Myst and fell in love with the series. If you pay attention to the law it’s really just an story of a bad father and misbehaving kids. Money goes to saving Saavedro despite the nightmares he gave me as a kid.
GDQ, prevent cancer foundation, chance for golden eye prize... how can I not throw my name in the hat.
Knock knock.Who's there?Myst.Myst who?Mystical Goose. HONK!!
I'm sad I couldn't watch the Skyward Sword run because of timezones, but at least I'm awake for the Myst games. And I'll get to catch up on the runs with the VoDs once the week is over. Thanks fr
Grew up with Myst, with Exile being one of my all time favorite games. Looking forward to seeing it crushed! Best luck to this block’s runners!
Hey, Zaustus -- I think you might have Myst a book or two. (Donation goes to runner's choice.)
Zaustus seems to really CLICK with this game. Let me know if you MYST that pun....HONK!
This is my first time donating at a GDQ. I had to donate since my Mother have had cancer and both grandmothers died to cancer.
Saavedro did everything wrong but honestly my bad
Of course we have to save Saavedro. Save is right there in his name, assuming you spell save with two A's!
Congrats on your first run at GDQ, Flapjack Senpai! From your wife and everyone else in TDS: We're so proud of you!
So much fun to see speedruns of the Myst games I played as a kid
Here's a small chunk to help. Been watching with my bro since 2016 and we've always donated. Glad this year to be able to do more. Thank you all for what you do. Rock on and from Canada HYPE
Rinda rinda
Thanks to the runners and GDQ for the awesome event and thanks to Cyan for making the most gorgeous puzzle games!
TYSM for reading this MYST donation
I am a Myst fan since my father played it in my childhood. I spent so many hours in URU... Good old times...
Loving all the Genesis/Mega Drive music! FM synth so crunchy and goooooood
Omg I love being here at aqgt 2020
We love Rinda, she must succeed!
Rinda Rinda Rindaaaaa
First time donation here, shout outs to all the runners here coming together for such a great cause! Stay fresh out there!
Hello GDQ and Flappy! So great to see all the runs again! Good luck to all the runners! Donation to Flappy's choice!
It's always a honor to host speedruns at the Internet Archive, and shout out to Chris Hanel and his marathon "quality control" checking
Excited to be watching AGDQ live for the first time! This is for my best friend Mat watching at home.
Hopefully you won't Voltaic the easy way out and decide to Releeshan Saveedro. Everyone knows that's the Real Best ending so to not do so would be a Myst opportunity!
So proud of seeing Admiral Flapjack do a speedrun of Myst III: Exile. Everyone at Team Dysfunctional Shenanigans is proud! Also so excited that the developers of Myst showed such support for these three speed runners to be at ADGQ 2020. P.S. Leave Saavedro, he seems suspect.
This is my first time donating and I wanted to say thank you for putting on such a great event.
Oh boy, if I was in that cage, I would have destroyed the dude singing opera. Also, shout out to the person in the hat with the flappable ears
It would be Myst-ical to have Rand and Robyn on the couch next year.
Hey Gelly and Admiral Flapjack! This is for the Return of the Obra Dinn community. It's awesome to see you guys on AGDQ running the Untitled Windows 3.1 Myst-ery game series. Wait, is that why it's called Myst?... Incentive is Flapjack's choice!
Greetings from Aersia! Cancer will not be Myst!
My eyes are getting myst-y from the end of this mini marathon!
Late? My day is just getting started. We will be doing the nightshift ;) greetings from europe
I'd be reMyst (remiss) not to donate during the Myst block. Here's to more terrible puns!
You don't like Myst puns? Boo hoo, cry me a riven.
I hope the community isn't Riven apart by all these puns, and that no one gets sent into Exile for them; they would be sorely Myst if they were.
Had to leave a donation for one of my favorite games from N64! Haven't seen Bomberman Hero speedran before, so looking forward to it! Let's push for $150k!
BRING ON THE REDIAL!
Just finished some Winter Break grading. Going back to school in 4 hours. Can you tell my son Willem that He needs to go to bed.
boo cancer
First time live viewer but long time fan! Let's beat back cancer together while enjoying some awesome speedruns!
Saving the midnight crew from boredom, thanks again GDQ!

Hey guys Zeno here, going on my 4th GDQ and felt the need to donate some of the Christmas funds. Here's hoping it goes to a good cause and we all tell Cancer to get bent.Put my money towards HONK GANG. HONK NEVER CHANGES.
20 years later and the Bomberman Hero OST STILL slaps!!
Thanks for hosting and here’s to the rest of what is shaping up to be yet another amazing GDQ!
AGDQ had gotten off with an explosive start and have enjoyed the runs so far, but Myst my chance to donate during the last block. Excited to see Liquid Squid play Hero as it is one of my favorite games in the series because the soundtrack is the bomb. Can't wait to see the rest of the runs this week as they should be a blast to watch.
Hello AGDQ, hello Squid....Hello Patrick. Here's to good music.
Big shoutout to my boy squid, proud of you for hitting the big time.
Hi Patty, this is Anonymous with no comment. I'm glad me and my wife get to spend a few hours with you and your sultry voice

I lost a good friend to cancer in 2019. Therefore I am happy to support GDQ. Here is the first to get my donation marathon started.... Greetings from Germany.
Bomberman Hero is an all time favorite n64 game and holds many memories for me and my brother.
Bomberman Hero is the most realistic game in the series.
Played this game a lot back in the day when you had to rent games from blockbuster. This game has great memorable music :)
I stayed up late for one of my favorite N64 games, I remember playing it on Sunday mornings. Also, Yatta!
Been watching for gdq for ages but have never donated so seemed like it was past due! thanks so much to all the runners and everyone involved for all you do!
First time coming to a GDQ, coming all the way Australia. Just woke up in order to watch this live. Love this game. Go Liquid Squid!
Bomberman Hero was the first video game my siblings and I owned. Lots of fun memories playing to this banging soundtrack! We're having a blast staying up late with everyone :) Cheers!
Been enjoying the audience "yatta" so much for this awesome Bomberman run that I thought I should inform everyone that "honk" in Japanese would be "gaa".
First time donating, shout outs to all the runners and the amazing ways they break our favorite games! Stay fresh out there, runners!
Long time watcher of GDQ's in general, wanted to finally get a donation in now that I can afford to set some money aside for AGDQ and SGDQ each year. Shout out to my brother James who is watching at home as well. I'll toss in another $25 if this gets read!
Hey squid you ever notice how those different colored slime enemies look like puyos?
Love y'all! >3Heck... love you >5
My boy squid on the big time, what a guy! Where the beers at?
This is one of those N64 games I never got around to but I'm really enjoying the run and the great commentary by the @KirkQ.
YATTA ^_^
So progressive
Hello from Tokyo!
Hello to all my speedfriends! The music in this game rips, and I get to listen to it for a good cause! Stay comfy.
First time donating, long time watcher! My brothers and I have been watching and reminiscing Bomberman!
YATTA
Bien le bonjour de la Suisse, un premier petit don pour s’échauffer.Vous faites du super travail LeFrenchRestream, bravo !#Subnautica
Always love hearing Patty on the mic late at night. This rocking soundtrack doesn't hurt, either.
Woke up just in time to listen to Patty and his amazing voice, first year watching first time donating, and happy to for such a great cause, keep up all the good work! Yatta!
Watching Games Done Quick is always a blast! I love seeing the booming success this has become with such explosive results. I sure hope these jokes don’t bomb. Keep up the great work everyone!
Good luck on the run Squid! I love this game, my sisters and I would always rent it on weekends. This music is seriously taking me back.Always love supporting GDQ and looking forward to another 10 years.
Bomberman is the life of the party: He always blows up the piñYATTA!
YATTA!
Bomberman Hero is the best snowboarding game on the N64. BOMBER CHANGE!
Happy to leave a donation during Bomberman Hero, such a charming game with an absolutely amazing soundtrack!
Donating for Patty's smooth voice. Also for cancer research, but mainly for Patty.
Woke up early to catch the N64 block, good luck to the runners!
LUL

Yatta
Good morning from Finland, keep up the good work!

Donating for Jun Chikuma's good good music~
Patty, it's great to hear your sensual tones reading the donations. Looking forward to this n64 block and more. Put this donation towards your choice, mister fours.
Thought that Bomberman cart Blew a Fuse for a moment there. I love watching this event with my treasured pal every year. Hi Roxanne! I've had a rough time lately but this cozy Bomberman Hero run is healing me a bit, so I thought I'd contribute to a great cause. We stan Jun Chikuma, V, and [redacted].
Pumped to see Bomberman right before I head to bed. Props to Squid for sticking to the grind, and shoutouts to everyone on the second couch and those sweet, sweet Ape Escape hats.
Cheers Squid. Good luck on the runs.
I turn back on AGDQ and I see Bomberman Hero being run? Fantastic, one of the best N64 games I ever played growing up as a kid! Keep up the amazing work on the run so far Liquid Squid & all the best with the rest of the week to all the AGDQ staff. #IDidIt
Will keep donating $5 if Patty keeps singing! Let the serenading dulcet tones begin
ProgramMax donates 50 smacker-oonies
When I heard the GDQ schedule was out, I searched the list for two things: video games I like and when Patty would be commentating. I'm glad I did, because I'm not sure if I would have stayed up tonight, and this run is really cool. Id say hi ho you, but someone already made you say hi to yourself, so so I'm going to say hi to myself instead. Hi Luke.
Hey Pat, will we be able to see you on the couch like last year, on the Link to the Past + Super Metroid Combo Randomizer run? I remember laughing so hard through the whole run. goooood times <3 greatings and love from germany.
And don't forget the joker
Donating for two of my favorite streamers. Squid and Patrick "PCULL44444" Patty. Never played this game as a kid, but I played Bomberman 64. So I guess that's cool.
As promised, here is the follow up $25. Big thank you to everyone who puts together these wonderful events every year. Put this second $25 towards runner's choice. Also, you got my name right on the second try, congrats XD
Awesome job to Liquid Squid! We loved playing Bomberman Hero back in the day. Such a fun game with an amazing soundtrack! Always look forward to AGDQ every year, can we get a “I did it!”?
Gotta donate for these banger bomberman tracks!
Really enjoying this run! Missed out on this game growing up and wanted to donate during this awesome run! Also Yatta > Honk
Hello from the audience squid can you please give us your best banjo impression
Donating $25 just to hear you say "smackaroonies", again.
The soundtrack for Bomberman Hero slaps. Shoutouts to all my Free Company friends on Final Fantasy XIV watching.
Loving the late night Patty, let's hit $150K by the end of Bomberman Hero!
Boom
Never played Bomberman before, but seeing new games is part of the fun of watching GDQ for me! Thanks for the run, Squid, and thanks as well to the lovably sassy Patty for hopefully reading this donation!
ONIOOOOLove you Squid
I was going to go to bed, but now I need to stay up for one of my favorite Nintendo 64 games. Yatta!
This donation is in memory of my former coworker Darnell Chipwich (this was actually his name) who lost his battle with cancer 5 years ago. He was a dear friend and he will be missed.

Shoutouts to Bomberman for having the best soundtracks on the N64.
Shout out to the siren people behind the couch
Hey as someone who sold their OG copy of Bomberman to pay off rent when I got laid off, I am SO happy to see someone playing it. I've missed the game, and selling that game made me so sad. but so happy to see it played again, and had to drop a sub and follow to support.
First time watching live, first time donating. Best of luck to all runners, and to blowing cancer away.
Hello Patty. It is time to break banks again.
Just here to make Patty say smackaroonies again.
Huge Bomberman fan here! Gotta show some love for featuring it on AGDQ
Finally off work and now I can watch the runs uninterrupted. Is anyone awake? Lets get some early morning HYPE!!!!!!...
My parents had an n64 for about a week before returning it and crushing my dreams of playing those classics at an early age There was one game that's been eating my up for far longer than it should have and all I remember is that they were shooting at a purple sphere together. Thank you AGDQ for finally solving the 20+ year mystery of Tetrisphere for me and I can't wait to see the run later today.
Bomberman is so cute! And this run and commentary is excellent 3am entertainment. Thanks for the great work!
I did it! But then they changed what *it* was. Now I have no idea what *it* is.
Look forward to GDQ every year! So happy to see Bomberman Hero being ran. Enjoying staying up and watching Liquid Squid dominate the run!
Here's a $5 donation from anonymous. And we are just $5000 away from hitting $150000. This is the greatest commenter asking you all to donate and help us hit that goal. I'm not reading their comment anymore, just wanted to remind everyone how great of a person I am.
G! R! DOUBLE E! N! LEAVES! YATTA!!
:Pattysquint:
All I can manage at the moment, but it’s for a good cause. The runners and announcers are all awesome Kupo! Keep doing what you’re doing Kupo!
I always make a point to donate every year for my best friend who lost his fight with cancer at 25. Never forget to tell loved ones how much they mean to you. Keep up the good work AGDQ.Oh and uh... Yatta?
Good Luck Necrocoptor! May RNG bless you with the gift of speed!
Let's start this 5$ train to get to 150k. YATTA!
I know he doesn't look like one, but Bomberman is a boomer.
I'll donate another $20 if Squid says "Trans Rights"
do it for patty
This run is very Poggers, cant wait to see more epic bomberman runs
I just have to donate on the 10th anniversary of AGDQ! And I know exactly what I'm donating to. I've always loved the Sonic 06 speedruns for showing how a trainwreck can be broken further. Hopefully Silver's playthrough will be OF USE!!! to dealing with cancer! Thanks so much for weeks of entertainment!
Great runs, amazing event. Thank you to everyone who makes it happen
CHOOCHOO KACHOO
Greetings from austria. What an amazing event each year. Saw the awesome isaac run before but couldn't donate while watching. Good luck to all runners and Edmund McMillen let us have a Repantance run SGDQ 2020 (fingers crossed).
Please tell me how the back couch acquired those Pipo Helmets, I must know
Had to donate for the explosive soundtrack and amazing gameplay. I've enjoyed GDQs for 5 years and hoping to enjoy them for many more.
Had to donate while my favorite snarky streamer, Patty, was hosting! Have a great week everyone! Save the frames!
Play games, beat cancer.
Glad I could donate again to one of my favorite events of the year! Best of luck to all the runners!

Giving up my morning coffee ahead of time just in case I forget! I’m doing it and you should too. Much love from New York!
Staying up late to support my bro. Praying to the RNG gods for a good final boss RNG.
Oh hey Yooka-Laylee 64 looks great!
Donating in hopes that Patty will read donations in his King Kai voice for a while.
For a friend.
Chameleon Twist 2 is the most important 3D platformer I haven't played.
Let's get to $150k! Also, thanks to everyone behind the scenes and good luck to the runners.
Glad to see Chameleon Twist being run! This was one of the first video games I ever owned, for some reason. I've always been disappointed the series didn't continue on from here...
YOOOO is that Necrocopter??? Hey peter
Donated last SGDQ for the Flappy hat in the audience and I'll do it again!Good luck to the runner.
$150,000 HYPE!
I am not animal expert but this character does not look like chameleon at all....
Had to donate during one of my favorite forgotten N64 platformers, especially since I get to see them with their cute, spherical heads instead of the more accurate, but less cute reptilian heads they have in the US version of the game. Also gotta shout out my boy Patty - Glad I got to catch your time on the mic this year!
This sound track is very good
More Patty voice, and more @nausicaa33 flappy ear hat. Best parts of GDQ. Yes Patty, no cancer.
You know with all the game rereleases that are popping up I wouldn't mind seeing this series showing up again. What's Sunsoft doing these days anywho?
I already donated for it, but I just can't get enough of Silver's whiny voice. Let's see a trainwreck get broken even further! All in for Sonic 06!
Rented both Chameleon Twist games as a kid, and despite how bizarre and janky they are, they still hold a warm place in my childhood. Thanks for playing it at GDQ!
I Rember playing this game as a kid but never beat it. So BEAT IT SUPER FAST also thank you for stopping caner.
the most wonderful time of the year, despite the number of skips involved, it's still a whole week
Hey everyone, donating from the future. It's the final day of GDQ and we're less than 25 bucks from breaking the record, figured I'd use time travel to make it so my donation is the one that puts us over. If Patty reads this it is canon.
Having some 2 am nostalgia watching this Chameleon Twist 2 run. Thanks for playing this gem from my childhood, and best of luck to the runner. Incentive goes to runner's choice.
Go Go Runners! Go Go AGDQ! Go Go PCF!
I never played this game, but it's been really fun to watch.
150k Hype
I do remember Gator Golf! The line from the ad, "You missed! Watch a pro!", remains a part of my family's lexicon to this day.
What could be greater than playing a game of golf with a gator?
HONK
Salut à tous, première fois que je donne pour un événement GDQ, j'écris juste pour donner toute mon énergie au commentateur pour le marathon, merci d'être là pour les bons comme les mauvais jeux, merci aux ambianceurs, au viewers pour leurs dons (d'ailleur, Bourrez les dons !) Hâte de voir DMC 5, bref merci des bisous à tous #GDQup
Hello AGDQ, here's another birthday donation, there will be more throughout the day! Thank you for everything, and sending out all the love to the runners and the audience, especially the front row dancers! HYPE!!!
Gooood morning from Denmark! Have my 20 and have a great day - looking forward to a week of running!

Hello AGDQ!Long time watcher and donater here.Had to donate while Patty is still on the mic.Let's smash that SGDQ19 goal and reach at least 3.5 million dollars!Greetings from Germany
Been looking forward to this gdq for months. Speed is always fun.
It's so late, but you know I gotta stay up for tapioca on a scooter. Good luck with the run, man!
Long-time watcher, first-time donating! My mother was diagnosed with cancer several years ago and thankfully won the battle. Here's hoping nobody else has to go through this. Cheers to everyone!
What could be greater than playing a game of golf with a gator?
Geese are the worst. But whatever, let's see some goose
go tapioca - we love jalapenos!
It's 4 in the morning here, and I've been shotgunning Final Fantasy VI all night. My mom got diagnosed with melanoma last year, but thankfully they caught it so early they were able to excise it before it was an issue. Folks, if you have the opportunity, talk to your doctor! Shouts out to the tech crew for keeping this whole thing together, and big ups to the morning crew in the audience for showing up so early. Get some sleep, folks!
Hi Tapioca! Good luck on the run! Put this towards the runner's choice. Also, can the couch introduce themselves?
Have you honked your Lonk today? GG y’all!
Greetings from Germany,The same procedure like every year, james.This Incentive goes to Announcers Choice.
How do you spell out with a Z?
Thanks to runners! Greetings from Rostov! The chair is flying!
Love AGDQ, saw the cause this year and knew I had to try and catch it live. You're doing amazing work!
I would love to hear Patty telling I donated five "schmeckles"...You all are so amazing!
GET 'EM TAPIOCA
Hey Tapioca! Hyped to see this game make it to GDQ. This game's soundtrack and handclaps are a treasure.
Greetings from the fellas in the Razor Freestyle Scootin' community! Good luck and thanks for all the rad scootin' you've been doing.
Yo here's that money I left here last time (runner's choice)
This escalated quickly.
My head is spinning at how much I'm enjoying this speedrun. I guess you could say it's WHEELY good!...Anyone?
When is the lime remaster coming out? Great run tapioca!
hey patty! $5 from anonymous here wishing you, all the runners, and the attendees a good gdq
tapioca won't say it, so I will: i love you mom
My parents had an n64 for about a week before returning it and crushing my dreams of playing those classics at an early age There was one game that's been eating my up for far longer than it should have and all I remember is that they were shooting at a purple sphere together. Thank you AGDQ for finally solving the 20+ year mystery of Tetrisphere for me and I can't wait to see the run later today.

Even though I have a messed up sleep schedule, I'm loving all the runs of the weird games I played when I was a kid with the impeccable Patty announcing. Good luck everyone on your runs! BTW Patty how are those potato puns
I had a wheel-y good time watching that run - will any other game match the awesomeness of Razor Scooters?Also, shout out to floppy hat lady! Flop those ears!
Hey there AGDQ,greetings from Germany! Best of luck to all the runners and massive shoutouts to everybody awake and kicking at the venue right now. Here's to another awesome week of AGDQ.
Doing a late donation for Binding of Isaac! Does Isaacs head count as an orb?
Tetrisphere hype!
Hey AGDQ, on behalf of the Slime Community we thank for putting on both a great show and fight against Cancer! Shoutout to my wonderful friend Thy :D Good luck to all the runners!
It's my birthday! Being able to watch AGDQ every year is the greatest. Good luck to all the runners! Greetings from Australia.
What up from the front row! I've been watching for years but this my first time attending, and I'm lucky enough to be seeing one of my very favorite games with my very favorite person, my embarrassed girlfriend who's sitting right next to me at this insane hour. Congratulations on ten years and also what I can only assume is a great Tetrisphere run!
My husband Jack introduced me to GDQ when we started dating. We lost someone close to us to cancer nearly a year ago. This is a surprise donation for him. I love you Jack! Enjoy your week off!
Good night from Hawaii!
I got told to donate, so here you go! Us Europeans really appreciate the night crew. Thank you.
GDQ is the best. Thanks to everyone involved!

I should be sleeping, but I had to stay up for my all time favorite Tetris game! You're all awesome for what you do and here's to another fantastic GDQ!
Patty said to donate so I'm donating. Thank you for a decade of fun, I hope there's a decade more.
tetrisphere is one of my favorite games of all time! shout outs to neil voss who composed the soundtrack
3D rubix tetris is too much while this sleep deprived
TetrisORB has a plot line? Rescue the robot! What madness is this?! May your blocks be round, FFR! Let's clear cancer like clearing Tetris lines.
First time donatingGood luck to everyone
It's a great big marathonLet's make cancer super punyPatty, here's my donationIt's 10 whole smackeroonis
I heard your donation guy was getting bored. My wife demanded that to be fixed! GG, and good day.
Donating in honor of my father who survived prostate cancer and was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer just after Christmas.Here's towards a future where cancer is no longer a major disruption to the lives of individuals and families.
Heard my favorite common-tater was getting bored, so I had to drop one more donation for Patty. Have fun everyone!
I'm disappointed by the lack of ORB in this game.
This is for one of my good friends from college, who just found out she has ovarian cancer. Luckily, it was caught early, earlier than it usually is, but she is heading into chemo treatments this week. Good luck Onlera <3
Hello from Germany!I've been watching GDQ for a long time now but still always look forward to the events. Super excited for a week of awesome speedruns that will completely break my sleep schedule.Good luck to all the runners and a huge shoutout to everyone involved.
We have nothing to sphere but sphere itself. Also, dang this game has hot jams! Crank it!
I have *no* idea what's going on here, but this is oddly compelling.Greetings from back couch!
This game gave me nightmares as a kid from the easter egg you got holding down the reset button. Seeing it trounced like this is... cathartic. Thanks for that.
Great to see a niche favorite of mine in this event. The incentive said the last Rescue is the hardest level... but I don't remember anything comparing to the Crystal Tower levels in Hide and Seek. Those levels were the definition of losing out of nowhere.
Rescue those googly eyes!
for my girlfriend andy who woke me up at 3 in the morning to sit in the audience for this delightful game
Yo Tay what uuuuup! Sorry I couldn’t make it this year, but stoked to see you on the couch for another of my N64 puzzle faves! So when’s your PPL 3D-mode run?
Shout outs from the front row for the most underrated N64 game. First person Tetris is lit.
Good morning to all you beautiful people.And hi Patty.Here's to a great week! Good luck to all the runners and... greetings from Germany.
Anyone else remember the most sophisticated gaming experience ever created by humans? It's spherical! SPHERICAL!
Hey, how are ya?
I don't understand this game, but it looks like you're doing great, so here's some money
It’s 11 AM here in Sweden, enjoying a late breakfast and watching AGDQ is a great way to start the week. Keep up the good work!
The sphere is a lie! The grid is on a donut with a fish eye lens. Anyway, put my donation to sonic'06.
Tetris shennanigans are always a thing of beauty. Speaking of beauty, how about those OoT Stained Glass Spiritual Stones? Times almost up, better get those donations in now folks...
Always good to hear Patty on the mic. Donating in support of this utterly baffling N64 block.
Love ya'll! Let's prevent cancer with awesome games speeded through, my favorite event of the year!100 $ train? :eyes_emoji:
This Tetris Sphere run is comforting to watch, reminding me of my childhood playing Puzzle Pirates. Shout out to flappy hat lady in the crowd!
Donating during the game that brought my mom and me together in gaming
Hey Patty thanks for holding us down during the late nights.Cant wait for you to commentate during Awful Games later this week always the spotlight of my Agdq week.Heres ten dollary-doos now and I'll be back to drop some more for the greatness that is Awful Games.Good luck to all the runners this week.
Have you all heard about the new Tetris movie?It's getting delayed because every time they finish a line, it disappears.Had to add my own bad pun hopefully it gets read out to make the crowd groad with happiness. Love what you all do here is to another 10 years
Let me out of here already!
Watching while I work the overnight shift. I'm always surprised to see games I didn't know existed get played so masterfully. Also, I'd love to hear the announcer say their favorite tongue twister for another donation.
Long time watcher, first time donator.This is one of my favourite events of the year, and now that I'm finally armed with a decent job, I figure some of it should go to a good cause.Keep up the great work!
Enjoying the runs so far :)Lets get those Bonus Games met.
Good morning from Germany.With this week I am still on my holidays from work to catch the entire AGDQ atleast I try. Sleep less run more!
There is really nothing to fear about this game, except sphere itself.
GDQ always brings a smile to my face, so I gotta donate. Good job to all the runners and night crew!
Bon début de semaine à tout les runners, tout les ambianceurs, tout les commentateurs, tout les viewers sur tout les chat de chaque pays. Paix et amour dans la communauté du jeu vidéo contre le boss final : CANCER. Des coeurs d'amour à tous. #goupixGood start to the week to all the runners, all the ambianciers, all the commentators, all the viewers on all the chats in each country. Peace and love in the video game community against the final boss: CANCER. Hearts of love to all.
It's no use!
Revelry in the dark. Good luck to all the runners!
Superstar Saga hype! One of my GBA favorites. Played a lot of it, mainly because my cart is faulty so I had to start over every time I turned it on. Looking forward to the Bros dancing along to the battle music!
Oh wow ten years, thank you to everyone involved with GDQ for the journey and the memories.

My father had cancer caught early. I wish similar luck. To all the runners, best of luck and entertainment for charities sake.
Always happy to donate to a really good cause, and I cannot wait to see a speedrun of one of my favourite RPGs ever, Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga.
I was supposed to wake up early for the Mario and Luigi run, but never fell asleep. Could really use some caffeine right about now. Hope the rest of the night troupe is doing well!
thank you to those still awake, from those who are also still awake. bada bing bada boom wheres the hype in this room?
Thanks GDQ for being here for all us night shift workers.
Greetings from Japan! Watching the AGDQ live for the first time, and I'm excited to give to the cause! Thanks for keeping me entertained while I'm making dinner. Keep it up everyone!
Merci a tout les commentateurs pour votre travail, et merci pour la découverte de tetrisphere, un régal (non) #MarioLight
Here's $50 for that tongue-twister from Patty, Never heard that one before!
I'm not John, but that was an impressive tongue twister.Cheers!
Well, I said I would donate if you did a tongue twister, and here it is! Sadly my coworker made me miss the last bit of it, but what I heard was truly wonderful. You da best! Donation goes to announcers choice!
Wow, the music is so great Is there a GDQ playlist somewhere? I'd so listen to it. Thanks for everything you guys do, stay awesome!
Almost lunchtime in germany. :o) Looking forward to my break with AGDQ. :-)Greetings and have fun!
Got up early to donate while one of my favorite games plays. Thanks everyone for this marathon and ten years of content, can’t wait to see how long it goes.
Hey guys, good luck on the run. Oh, and Sjorec- don't forget to get away from the doors.
It's the most wonderful time of the year. Good luck to all the runners!

I can’t believe they’d allow such explosive language in a Nintendo game.
Hey all! Had to donate for the Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga run and also the amazing GhostKumo on the couch! Cheers!
[FR] Please keep the good work guyZ
Have been watching agdq since I woke up yesterday, which was about 1 pm central, 2pm where gdq is held. I've been watching the youtube part for a few years, and last year, almost to the day, I finally caught a livestream. Glad I can finally donate to support an amazing cause like the prevention of cancer. Donation goes to making Bayonetta 2 played on 3rd Climax
[FR] @Dec4rius : Toujours un plaisir de donner pour cette fondation, une personne proche à vaincu son cancer ! Abats la maladie ! #TempeteDivine (Je vous aime tous ! Mais plus @Aelthan)[EN] @Dec4rius : Always a pleasure to give to this foundation, a person close to defeating her cancer! Take down the disease! And Kill the animal Kappa
FAWFUL HAS CHORTLES
I love this game! Peace and love
It is a lot easier to wake up for work when you have AGDQ to watch. And it is a lot easier to get through the workday when you can stream at work. Keep up the amazing work everyone!
Superstar Saga's one of my favorite games of all time; good luck on the run, Murmilio & Sjorec!
Long time watcher and couple time donator here. Got really excited when AGDQ started and have already ruined my sleep schedule watching the first runs. Superstar saga is one of my favorite childhood games and replayed it lots of times as a kid. Good luck to all the runners this week and thanks to all the staff for organising this awesome event!
Greetings from Ireland. I'm sleep deprived from watching gyms awesome run last night but couldn't miss superstar saga co-op. My girlfriend and I are watching at work from our jobs and loving the run. We love watching gdq together. Thanks for having this awesome game we Europeans can watch and congrats on 10 years.
Just want to wish "good luck!" to all runners. Keep it up guys! Let's beat that cancah' !
Superstar Saga is one of my all-time favorite games! I used to do co-op runs on the Gamecube Gameboy Player because all controllers register as Player 1, with one person limited to the A button only and the other B only, including on Bros. Attacks! It made the game a great team experience. Keep up the great work guys and best of luck on the run!
Best of luck to all the runners. You're all fantastic, don't give up!
Good luck to both Mur and Sjorec! Shoutouts from the back couch, and also, don't fail the minecart minigame.
AGDQ's sweet stream will soon be the bread that makes the sandwich of Prevent Cancer Foundation's desires! And this donation shall be the delicious mustard on that bread! The mustard of cancer's doom!
Have to donate for one of my favorite games of my childhood. I remember the countless times I had to hide my Gameboy under my pillow and having to figure out how to hit both the "A" and "B" buttons at the same time with my little thumb. GLHF to the runners!
I want to thank that random guy who worked in a welsh game shop, who suggested I watch GDQ around 4 years ago, I've watched it every single year since! Looking forward to the next 10 years of GDQ!
Greetings from Colorado. Superstar Saga is my favorite Mario RPG, so I'm up early on a work day to watch this run. Can't wait to see how Murmilio expertly controls Mario and... the Green one. Good luck, and save the beans.
Je ne sais pas trop quoi écrire, alors je dirais simplement que je peux finalement participer à cet événement fabuleux. Bravo à tous et courage pour le marathon !#TempeteDivine
Hey guys, kinda sad here but my dog just passed away tonight. thanks though for the great marathons to help me trough these tough times. even though it wasn't what got my dog, lets kick cancers butt
Mario and Luigi use bro attacks, but what about bruh attacks? Bruh. You're doing a great job, bruh. Love from the back couch
Joined in time for one of my favourite games, GL for the run!
Had to donate during Mario & Luigi, loved the game growing up and still a great game. Thank you to my wife Caitlin for the surprise donation in the previous run. good work to everyone at GDQ and keep up the amazing work.
Long time watcher and I actually work for a company that tries to beat cancer i figuered why not spend some for this awesome cause too.
Super Mario hype! Beyond excited to watch one of my favorite speedrunners play one of my favorite childhood games! Good luck, Murmilio!
I set my alarm for 4:30 to catch this run of my absolute favorite game. Keep up the great work. Year of Luigi!
Je ne sais pas trop quoi dire, donc je me contenterai de dire que je suis ravi de participer à cet événement. Bravo et bon courage pour l'ensemble du marathon !#TempeteDivine
Woke up at 4:30 in the morning just to see this run!! Good luck to Murmillo and Sjorec with that dreaded final boss! I HAVE FURY
Been watching AGDQ since 2013 and always excited to see it live. Even more exciting is seeing Murmilio speedrunning Superstar Saga once more. Good luck everyone!
Man I haven't played this game (Mario and Luigi Superstar saga) since I was kid. Thanks AGDQ for bringing back the nostalgia where my strongest memory is being stuck for hours as I didn't realise you could turn Luigi into a surfboard.
Woozle Wazzle
Murmillio's movement with Luigi was legit godly. I'm hooked man. Good job finding these guys AGDQ

Good morning from New Jersey, USA! First time watching GDQ; my mother was diagnosed with cancer in early 2019; thank you for supporting such an amazing cause, keep up the good work.
Been watching since near the very beginning and never had the chance to donate until now, so I’m finally putting a bit into the pot myself in memory of my Grandmother’s passing from cancer about 5 years back now. Putting this towards Sonic ‘06, after her jokingly calling me “Tails” during my long binges of Sonic gaming after school. Besides, nobody can deny that rocking soundtrack no matter how bad the game is!
OH WOW! Its Skyblazer! this was the first game i ever had and when i told friends about it nobody ever believed me that it was a real game.
I watched GDQ for many times and its now to donate. love klonoa speed run in one of the previous GDQ and hope we can see new speed run for klonoa 2 ...and good luck to all speed runners
First time donating ! Let's beat Câncer togheter!Let's Go to Sonic 2006!Haha
My dad was diagnosed with cancer last year, after a couple of stressfull months he is now recovering. Thank you guys for putting in the effort for charity, keep up the good work.
Hey! I gotta donate for the man who literally wrote the book on speedrunning. Good luck Omni, and shout outs to Blechy on the couch! Always great to see you both!
Woooo! Excited for Skyblazer baby!
I need a Sonic 06 run like I need air! Plus it'll give me incentive to wake up early.Also hi to my slime pals, here's to a fun week of chilling out and watching speedruns!
Just Love! Thx guys ... long time follower ... Kill the animals
I've never heard of Skyblazer before now, but I love just how much it reminds me of Hook and it's always a treat to see something new. Good luck Omni and here's to ten years of GDQ.
De retour pour ce super event !!Merci à tous les commentateurs de donner de leur temps pour nous et pour la bonne cause.Go bourrer les dons !!! #DarkMage

Blechy and Omni together? What an embarrassment of riches!! $250 for both Omni and Belchy's choice. Keep up the good work GDQ. My mother was diagnosed several years ago with cervical cancer and early detection helped her get treated and is still around to this day. Truly a worthy cause.
Thank you, Omni for a wonderful run to wake from my childhood!
Skyblazer has been the best commentary of the run, to the point I plan to pick it up and try it!Incentive to The Outer Worlds, let's get Taako back on TV!
Donating for my favorite underappreciated SNES game. Screw cancer and destroy Raglan!

Good morning everyone! First day at work after more than 2 weeks of leisure with family, friends, gaming and many long nights. No suprise that I feel like a wreck after getting up so early today. But thanks to agdq I have an enjoyable day so far! Shoutouts to Fabian, Domino and Isabelle - and the dancer in the front row! What is your name? More donation coming up tomorrow!
So pumped to see this Mystical Ninja Race. I tried to learn the run several years ago and am happy to see how the routing has changed and especially how the runners dealt with the money-problem. YOU out there. Go play all of the Mystcial Ninja (Ganbare Goemon) Games. They are amazing.
Super excited to see The Legend of the Mystical Ninja race! Best of luck to both participants, and Go Teleo Go!!
Go GDQ!

Greetings from Brooklyn New York! Just returning to work from an amazing weekend of intense volunteering and spending time with friends at Magfest.

And to all of those watching please give yourself a round of applause. You deserve it! Let us beat cancer!

Good Morning GDQ! Looking forward to a fun-filled week of speedruns and no work productivity. Shout out to the guy in the front row that's been keeping the party going all morning, you rock dude. Let's see that Sonic '06 run.
I have no idea what is going on but it's strangely fascinating. Good luck to all runners. Peace.

I've been watching GDQ for several years now, and I always love seeing new games done faster than I could ever imagine them done! This one's for my Grandpa who died of lung cancer.

Hey KLM! You've been a huge part of my speedrunning life, and I'm really happy to see you on stage! (also hi alex!!)
Good Morning Everyone! There's nothing better on a sick day than watching speed runners destroy Cancer! Let's get that first Bonus game cause who doesn't want to see more of Sonic 06?
Had to donate for the ActRaiser game, because this one actually was the first game I saw as a speedrun and which ultimately got me more into them.Good luck to the runner!
Another donation. Keep up the good work. Greetings from Germany.
Glad to see some oldschool racing in the morning.
Mah man Metroid McFly on the big stage once more! Looking forward to all Acts being Raised. And Syn, the only one brave enough to face the human TAS. This donation goes to winner's choice, and loser will get a consolation box of Waffle Crisp. Now go be Professionals!!!
Hyped to see the ActRaiser race! This was one of my favorite games as a kid and McFly is one of my favorite streamers. Go fast!
Hey AGDQ, First time donation from my side, i realy love the way you collect money for such a great foundation. My mother and my father both luckily beat their cancer, and i hope with our help, lots of other people will do too! Best regards from Germany

Always cool to see people rally together for a good cause like this. Thanks to everyone streaming and donating!
Love donating for a good cause, and hey, if I could get a battletoads shirt for my wife, even better.Good luck to all the runners this week.
good luck
Can Sonic '06 be broken even more than it normally is? I am willing to find out.
first time donating. Actraiser is one of my favorite snes game
Love watching the show every year :) Good luck to all runners!
I've played Dark Souls, I've played the first Zelda, the first Metroid and all. But Actraiser is the game I hated the most, cause I can't get for heavens sake through the last boss. So naturally that's the game I had to donate during. GL to the runners! Lots of love (and hate) from Germany.
Donating in memory of my mom who died of cancer in November. She got me ActRaiser for Christmas when I was a lad, so I am honored to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation during this beautiful game. Good luck to the racers!
That Paper Mario TTYD Watercolor sounds great, and who could not love Actraiser! Good luck in the rest of the week everyone! I'll be watching.
So hyped for this Actraiser race and even more hyped to donate to this great cause. Keep up the good work, GDQ. And let's put this donation towards CV 4 hard mode incentive!
My GF paid for pizza last night, so here's my pizza money!
Donating for Bonus Game 1 for my friend Focus, who is doing said run. We’ve been friends for something like 6 years at this point and I’m very proud that he’s going to get Silver No MSG on the big screen. The run has changed an unbelievable amount since Parax/Aruki’s run 7 years ago, and there’s nobody better to show it off.
Yes. ActRaiser. Yes. Please.
I don't know what's happening to me.I'm getting all the blame for things I didn't do.Will anyone please tell me what I did wrong?I'm all alone and oh so confused.I don't know what everyone wants me to be.I only know just how to be me.Once I was the ape of the hour.Not they think I'm a coward.An absolute zero,I'm nobody's hero.
Super hyped for this ActRaiser race sYn is one of my favorite streamers. One of the best examples of a welcoming and amazing speedrunner. Sad there are no teddy grahams
Hey GDQ, I hope you’re all doing great so far!First time donator here. Since almost literally stumbling across some of your VODs 2 or 3 years ago (thanks to Youtube for this one!) I’ve watched quite a few of them with great interest and am now able to catch GDQ live for the first time!Losing my mother to cancer late last year hit me pretty hard, after having cared for her for most of 2019. Hopefully this will help so that others can have their friends or loved ones around for longer. Keep doing what you’re doing!All the best to everybody and greetings from Germany!
WOW!
A humble request for someone to attempt the DK rap during the Donkey Kong Country 3 run
First time donating, just wanna say y'all are doing a great job. Raise some acts! Can I get a "HEAR-YE, HEAR-YE" from the host?
It's now been four years since I won my own fight with cancer. I'm glad to donate to the good fight while watching one of my all-time favorite games: ActRaiser. Let's stay DETERMINED to beat cancer, friends.
This is for Sherbear.
Tuning in shortly before work. Can't help but love all the speedruns and support what AGDQ is doing!
Great to see Syn Stream raise some Act.Praise Waldo!
long time viewer first timer donater lets save those frames boyyyyys
Good morning, AGDQ! Lizstar, I hope you're having a fantastic morning! Thanks for holding the fort down during my workday. And now, time to further procrastinate! Everyone in chat, stay hydrated! YOU GOTTA GRIP'N'SIP!!!
A few months ago I got a job where I can half-watch AGDQ while I work. If I'm getting paid to watch speedruns, it only seems right that I pay that money forward to help fight cancer. Thank you all for what you do.
Great race! And I'm so pumped for the upcoming "& Block"! Good luck to all the runners.
Good Luck Colin! Much Love from the Kotor Community!
Glad I could donate to such a great cause! 4th year watching AVGDQ!
Run, Run, Run, as fast as you can! They can't catch you, you're the speedrunner, man! Setting this towards naming Wingull JOTARO!?! in Pokemon Sapphire. ORA!
Shoutout for the potato crew
Shout out to DANCE DAD
Good luck!
Keep up the good work AGDQ!!
Donating for my friend Sara, who is currently battling stage 4 cancer, I hope one day no-one will have to go through what she is. Great job folks !
best luck to all runner wanted to donate on Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga but got denied by paypal
Took the week off to watch the 10th anniversary of GDQ! Have been watching since CGDQ, and look forward to many more!
Left the stream on while I went to make breakfast. Sprinted back into the room when I heard about the Sonic 06 Bonus Incentive. If we all chip in, it’s sure to be of *some* use, right?
Did someone say Sonic '06?? How can I not donate to see the objectively best sonic game of all time? ...Nope, couldn't say that with a straight face...
Battletoads & Double Dragon is my favourite game from my childhood. There will be no better time to make a donation 😁Greetings from Poland.Kill the cancer 🏹🦀
Only watch speedrunning on AGDQ, but love the cause! Blechy is a great host!
I need to see this Sonc 2006 run. Honk!
GDQ GDQ woo woo woo!
Hi all, had to donate for my main man Colin, good luck with the run and amazing to see you at GDQ! Cheers!
Thanks for putting on such a wonderful event! Saw that DKC3 was coming up soon good luck V0oid and to all the runners.
Toss a coin to your Dance Dad & Mom!!
Watching battle toads from the hospital today. Donating to speedy recovery for my husband and everyone else whos not going home today.
Quel plaisir de vous retrouver pour une nouvelle semaine de réjouissances avec des gens qui courent vite. Des bisous à tous (sauf à Ridlaids) #LonaLink
Greetings from right here! Trying to prevent the 06 run from happening? It's no use!
Honk! Towards the Rash plush
There's a long history of cancer on both sides of my family, and I lost both my grandfather's to cancer. One of whom I never got to know. This is the first year I've been able to donate, thought I've been watching since 2014, and I'm glad it can go to such a good cause. Good luck to all the runners.Donation to runners choice.
Put this towards Sonic 06 please. I need more of that game in my life.
Donating for my dog Luke, who I had put down this morning. He was a good boy.
Long time watcher, first time donator here. Can't wait for V0oid's run of DKC3. Rooting for you like always!
Let's go DKC3! Get those raw- I mean green bananas!
Here's to preventing cancer and to the most underappreciated DKC game! Incentive goes to DKC 3 filename Honk. I'll do another $50 if the crowd yells "HONK!"
That was an amazing run! Not to mention that the intro music for the game is so good
Greetings from Beijing, China!I had The Great Circus Mystery as a kid but never managed to beat it. MAKE IT BEG FOR MERCY.We don't say hype out here we say 'Jia Yo' which means 'add oil'Jia Yo my dudes! So proud of all the speedrunners and donors this week!
To a speedy recovery and to successful chemo
I love the dancing Dad <3
The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey and Minnie was one of my favorite games to play as a kid; I used to make my parents play it with me for hours! I can’t wait to see it be destroyed in a speed run! I’m watching with my 2-year-old and a soon-to-be-born-baby in utero, both of whom I look forward to playing this game with in the future!
So fortunate to be at AGDQ for the second time with my best friend Lew! Happy ten year anniversary, GDQ, let's put an end to cancer!
Hi guys, im from Germany and very thankful for your amazing support and all those nice runs! Im a Snesmaniac and enjoy this RUNS WITH A BUNCH OF BEERS! CHEERS!
Greetings, GDQ, and Happy 10th Anniversary! Shout out to all my Realms LARP buddies who may be watching. Let's all donate what we can this week, and eradicate Cancer as we go fast fast fast! Oh, and HOOOOOONK!
Honk
I am so happy that GDQ is finally back! Cannot wait for all of the awesome runs coming up and also for everything during the week. Thank you for everyone making this amazing event happen!
Always love watching AGDQ, good luck to all the runners. I'll donate an additional $0.50 for everyone who follows me on twitter today. Save those animals.
Sonic 06 is the game we need to see! Gotta donate fast or else it's NO USE!
Dance Dad is love, Dance Dad is life! love you all, gl hf!
C'est vrai qu'il est trop mignon ce Cacodémon, je le veux ! #zhtDoom
Want to thank all the amazing speedrunners and donaters supporting a good cause. Let's see that Sonic-06 run!
Here's a little something from me, to say thanks for all you do. Expect more throughout the week
The earlier donation about being able to watch while working inspired me to also donate, as I'm fortunate enough to be able to do the same. Props to GDQ, the runners, all the contributors, and of course PVC. Love to all those battling cancer or knows someone who is.
Here's to a decade of GDQ. Seems appropriate to donate the 10 bucks I was going to spend on lunch.
Great work guys!!
Loads of respect for the skills and dedication of all the runners, announcers, and organizers. Thanks for everything you all do, and may you have incredible runs!
Donkey think this run is great?! Kong you believe these time saves?!
Sonic 06 is the best worst game. This is my first time catching a GDQ live, and the first time I've been able to donate!
Honk!
Thank you for all that you do and to all the crew, runners and staff!
Thanks for all you guys do! <3
Salut les Kongs ! Toujours un plaisir de revenir ici, même si revenir à l'AGDQ signifie qu'on s'est toujours pas débarassé du cancer. Continuez à bourrer les dons, on finira par lui casser la bouche. Des bisous à l'orga, au tchat, aux modos (pas à Moa, par contre) !
Sonic Block's around the corner, and we still need to close out the '06 incentive! My sources tell me if FocusSight destroys this game at AGDQ, no one will ever have to play Sonic '06 again! Do it for the future! (Honk!)
much love :)
V0oidW
<3
i got out of bed to donate immediately when i heard there was a sonic 06 incentive
smile check :)
Love watching games I grew up with getting some love and attention from GDQ. Keep going strong boys and girls
Long time seeing first time donating, let's keep the amazing work.
Sonic 06 you say? Take my money!
Will miss the DKC run, so am donating now, thanks for a great event!
GDQ is making the first day of my last semester of college so much better, but less productive. Had to donate to get the worst game I've ever played, Sonic 06, onto the stream. Thanks for everything you all do
First Time Donting, GL to all Runners and have fun!
It’s so surreal seeing this game after 25 years. My sister and I used to play this game all the time and get into fights over who got to land the final hit on the final boss. Ahhh memories.
Gotta go fast!
My coworkers keep trying to talk to me! Don't they know I'm watching AGDQ??? Let's get that Sonic '06 on deck so I can really have a great Monday!
I’m donating 5 dollars for each of my favorite people at GDQ. Shoutout to Ian, Jess, and Miles. HAWNK it up!
Isn't every boss a "Minnie" boss?
Great!
Thank you for supporting such a great cause!
It's some use.Put this towards the Sonic 2006 bonus game.
This is the first year watching AGDQ with my husband, we watched many years before together. Here is to get the Sonic bonus game. Would Sonic also say HONK?
Loved the GDQ events since I first learned about them in 2014 and still been a fan of seeing the games be broken. Lets tell cancer "It's No Use"by putting this donation towards Sonic 06, because much like Silver, we too have a dream to change the future.
HONK
GDQ has the best vibes in all of gaming, thanks for all the hard work! Here's $50 for Sonic 06 because life is hard and we should all bond over everlasting loading screens and uncomfortable romantic subplots. Lots of love from Norway!
let there be bep
Vive les GDQ, et merci au FrenchRestream pour leur travail. #GDQup
Good Luck for all the runners Greeting from Finland
Hey V0oid, have you heard of Donkey Kong Country 2 HD Remake Bramble Scramble? It's one of my favorite DKC HD Nostalgie remasters and you should give it a listen! Good luck on your runYour Favorite Otter#rollindeep

Good luck to my man V0oid on the DKC 103% run. There is no one better to finally showcase this run at GDQ.

Long time watcher, first time donator. Now that I’m in college I have the whole week off with nothing to do but watch some great games being played fastly!
Good luck V0oid! DKC3 one of the best games ever made.
If the TheYetee doesn't own a T-shirt cannon named "The YEET-y", they should get on that.
We need more HONK.
Put it toward Sonic '06... for all your amusement needs. And one more thing... HONK
Hey v0oid!! Is this world record??

gotta get that sonic! gotta go FAST!
Having played Sonic 06 casually on stream last year, I had to donate when I found out there was an incentive for the game. Remember, folks: it's no use.
Amazing event for a great cause. Thank you for being awesome!
Sonic 06? Honk Yeah!
Allez pour la DKTV il faut donner ! #MarioLight
Long time viewer, first time attendee/volunteer. Everyone I've met so far has been so friendly and amazing and that bone guitar looks dope. Lost my Aunt to cancer a few years back and I don't want to see others lose their loved ones anymore.
Donating to see Sonic 06 get destroyed! Don't tell me it's no use!
Hey! Been watching in absolute amazement for the past 4 years. After every run I always hear the runners giving shout outs to friends, family and gdq staff. I'd like to give a shout out of my own. Shout out to all the people fighting cancer right now. You're all warriors and we know you can beat cancer, so hang in there and kick cancers ass! (Feel free to say butt here lol) because the world loves you, and most importantly the world NEEDS you. <3 Love you all
My grandma passed from lung cancer around 30 years ago without being able to meet a single one of her grandchildren. a year ago her sister was diagnosed with the same type of cancer but thanks to early detection her treatment has been going smoothly, the tumor has been significantly reduced and she is basically out of danger! So I'm very thankful to organizations like PCF for these progresses and to GDQ for supporting the cause! On another note my bestie travelled all the way from Dominican Republic to spend his birthday watching the event and he's sitting right there in the audience! Can I get a "Happy Birthday Juan" from the audience to make his experience even better?!
Thanks to all the runners and staff who make this event possible. Good luck to all the runners and have a great event!
Rollin in! Glad to see my boy V0oid running DKC3 103%. Need to donate during his run and wish him the best of luck. Let´s roll deep and kick cancers butt! GDQ HYPE <3
Cancer Bad, Speedrunning good
YEET
So excited for the DKC3 run. Often overlooked, never under loved. This is the one I have the most fond memories of playing as a kid with my brother. Excited to see V0oid rip this game apart.
AGDQ is, as always, ... tihi ... awesome. Good Luck to Void!
greetings from austria, first time donating, been watching for multiple years and i'm happy to finally be able to contribute to this great causeshoutouts to all my wonderful friends and all the wonderful people working to make this event happen
Long time donator first time viewer. I don't really understand what's going on but you kids seem to be having fun. Who are the animals, and why do they need saving? Anyway... I think I donated towards the sonic incentive. Why broken games are good I don't know, but hopefully you all can show me why.-Grammy Cath
Love to all of GDQ, so much hype for a DKC3 run! And for the person reading this, you're awesome!
Had to get in during Donkey Kong Country 3, the first soundtrack I ever owned, setting me on a lifelong video game music obsession. (Shoutouts to weird Jack in the Box Happy Meals.)
En hommage au chien le plus "glop glop" de France, renommons le chien de Rinoa "Pif" ! Car c'est aussi un gadget et "pif", on le balance sur les ennemis ! Bisous bisous ! Ouaf !
Beep Boop.
French donator here big shootout to LeFrenchRestream !!!Since 2017 i started to watch The Games Done Quick and never had the possibility to donate for a good cause, thank you for your marathons every year keep going !!!!!
What's up v0oid? DKC3 was my very first video game and I've been waiting since 2012 to see this category finally get its time in the sun. Donations go to Sonic 06, an extra $10 for one cycle Kaos. And as always, #RollDeep
This run had better be bananas.
~ h o n k ~
Speedrun strats saved me from Silver's wrath and the number ball section hell when I was playing Sonic 06 for the first time this year. This donation towards getting it as a bonus game is the least I can do to give back
Super excited for this DKC 3 speedrun! Good luck!
To one of my favorite games and one of my favorite events! Happy AGDQ everyone! HJONK.
Been looking forward to this, V0oid! Beat the WR
Best of luck to my main man, V0oid! Go catch those gnarly waves, bro, and keep on ROLLING DEEP to prevent cancer!
Donkey Kong HYPE!
DKC 2 was my childhood, but I loved DKC 3 very much! Let's see DKC 2 next year!!!!
The amount of money you've raised thus far is bananas! Good luck on the run, V0oid!
His coconut... wait, wrong game. Great work, keep it up!
Good luck to my man V0oid from your friends from the whatever discord and remember: Only love can defeat the Sui_min_Dragon
Good luck on the run V0oid! And how about a round of applause for the runners and GDQ staff who arrange this amazing event?
Love the marathon every year but gotta donate for the best DKC game, cant wait to see the 103% run.
Triste déception pour DK TV, Mais il reste Pokémon et FF VIII donc après Tatoualène, voici Leon ! (Vive KH)
Patrick Pichette and Maude Dignard loves you
Hype for Dixie and Kiddy rolling out to fight cancer in the BEST Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo! (yeah I said it)
Happy GDQ everyone! Thanks so much to the runners, organizers, and staff for making this event go off so well each year. It's responsible for some of my best friendships, so let's all join together to raise as much as we can!
Dkc is always one of my favorite runs to watch. Can’t wait to watch void crush the 103% category
I absolutely love DKC3 and played it for hours when I was a kid. Here's to a good cause...HONK
Shoutouts to the DKC game that's objectively the best and to one of my favorite runners in all of speedrunning, V0oid. Shoutouts coming from Berlin, Germany!
Been watching GDQ for years, happy to be able to support such an amazing cause. Keep up the good work, and let's see that Sonic '06 run!
That Kremling Coin looks absolutely stellar. I'm unlikely to get it, but hey, charity right? Glad I woke up just in time for the DKC3 run, haven't missed any of the DKC runs since I started watching the GDQ runs.
Figured I might as well donate after writing my first college paper on speedrunning... Love the trans inclusivity in this community and I cannot wait to see the trauma center run!
let's make cancer a sad, forgotten relic just like kiddy kong
TTYD Watercolor World Map? Yes please!
This won't make sense in english, but it will to V00ID."Ah-vo-ay V00ID, tail mayor, ace tea"
Hey V0oid, good luck with the run and Boomer skip and clips be blessed!
I wish my friend James was awake so that he could see this awesome DKC3 run.

v0oid! About dang TIME this run makes it into GDQ! I didn’t actually bother to look up where the bear skips are, so I just decided to give you $10 per Bear. (ish)Shoutouts to your AMAZING kouch krew. Looking forward to a v0oidNiceRun.
My son is obsessed with Meowser so I need that one!
It's a lovely day on the island, and you are a horrible K. Rool. Honkey Kong Country!
How can it be called Donkey Kong Country 3 if there's no Donkey Kong? I demand justice for our favorite monkey. In the meantime put this donation towards the Sonic 06 incentive. Gotta go fast!
I've been watching GDQ for a long time now and I'm happy to be able to make my first contribution to this amazing event. Watching it grow bigger and bigger every year really makes me hopeful for a better future for us all. Together we can do anything! So yeah, I'd like to thank everyone involved in this: runners, couch, hosts, tech crew, volunteers, crowd, twitch chat... You are all breathtaking!
More games at AGDQ is always a good thing. Let's Go Everyone!
I'm going to go for 103 percent along side V0oid.... Oh crud, I'm still on title screen! Okay, you take it from here dude! GL on GG.
Been watching GDQ vods for years but never managed to catch it live. Looking forward to a week of goose memes
DKC3 is one of my favorite games. Thanks for the boost of nostalgia this morning and good luck V0OID!!
Yo V0oid! ROLLIN IN! Yesterday my son spoke his first word, and it was "Banana"! so it must be a sign that he rolls deep. GL on the run v0oid
first time able to donate. Been watching for years, keep up the good work.
Saw the awesome prizes and I couldn't help but donate. Haven't seen much Sonic 06 but hoping to see some today. Go get that 103, Void!

Hole emoji
DONK!

My best friend and I would stay up all night to play the DKC series. He was legally blind and would love how inclusive GDQ and their events always are. We never beat DKC3 so I can't wait to watch it get destroyed!
Last month I learned that I have a rare type of pre-Leukemia called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Chemotherapy will start soon for me... Here is a donation for all the homies out there fighting Cancer. Don't give up. Thank you AGDQ and all the Runners for providing such a fun event and keeping Retro Gaming alive.
Taken a week of vacation so I can watch as much as possible of the amazing speed runs. Thank you all for making this event possible.
It's always a good time when v0oid is rollin deep.
DKC3 and some amazing prizes!? Have to donate during this game full of Krazy Kremling Krocs and Kritters! Also we are so close to the first Bonus Game! With so many Bonus Barrels in this game, lets get that Bonus!
Gotta go to work but I'm rooting for all of you! Sonic '06!
To everyone who runs a game at GDQ your amazing and thank you for all your hard work! To all the wonderful people that make GDQ possible you are miracle workers and also amazing! Love and peace!

I remember playing this with my brother in my dad's old restaurant on the SNES. So many memories! First donation of this year to AGDQ. Best of luck to all the runners and a big thank you to the staff, audience and everybody involved. HONK
It's been a long time coming, but I am ecstatic to see 103% at the 10th anniversary of GDQ. This category was my very first speedrun in 2013 and has made me involved with the Rollin' Deep community and many other amazing communities. Shoutouts to Techiyo, the pioneer of 103%. I will donate an extra $25 if V0oid nails GDQ Jump. ROLLIN' DEEP
No Honkment
Hi, at demonsmalls here from the back couch. I'm wondering why the game is on French? May Moyai and Winky bless the run.
Yo V0oid, zero here, glad to see you show off this amazing run to the world on a GDQ. Always awesome to see you grind the games on stream, shoutouts to the amazing couch behind you. My grandpa sadly died to lung cancer a couple of years ago, so I have a rather personal reason to donate. Lets beat cancer and don't forget: Heck Rambi.
gj not choking on spider V0oid, rest of the game is free DataFace shoutouts to Supreme for being a cool guy <3
Keep on rolling 😎
Sup V0oid, Jester here! Haven't caught your stream in a long time, but snuck some GDQ during my off hour so I could watch you at school! Keep up the great work, money to V0oid's choice

Rollin in. Good luck v0oid with this awesome run. And shout outs to the great couch. Roll unfathomably deep.
I had my fair share of problems in my family due to cancer, so maybe I can help prevent it for others.
had to donate during V0oids run! His DK2 102% speed runs are what got me into speedrunning.Best this game like I used to beat at MTL PTQs back in the day.
"You have to run, you cannot walk, this is a race against the clock!" Thank you runners and GDQ for supporting a great with games! RUN BOYS! HYYYYPE
Question for Supreme on the Couch: Are you a mod in the GDQ Chat yet?
Hey V0oid,ROLLIN' IN.I want to share my favorite V0oid quote with everyone:"Unless you die, you can never roll to deep. If you roll unfathomably deep and make it out alive, you live to roll deep another day."Good luck on the run, buddy!Love, Breaddy
BEAR IN! Best of luck to my boi V0oid on his 103% run! Shoutout to Goemon legend CLAUDE and the rest of the couch for providing their excellent commentary.
Long time watcher, first time donator! I grew up watching my older sister play DKC 3, so seeing a runner like V0oid destroy it is simply amazing. Good luck on the run, and to all the other runners this GDQ!
I stayed up late to watch Bomberman Hero and now I'm dead on my feet at work, so I hope you guys are happy. Put this toward Sonic 06!
Shoutouts to V0oid for this amazing run of one of my favorite games ever! Rolling deep!

Awesome game, awesome couch, awesome run, all on Awesome Games Done Quick!AUGH!
We’re going to hit that Sonic 06 goal and there's nothing that Sonic 06 can do about it. You could almost say, "It's no use!"
Just had to donate during this DKC3-run. It was one of my favourite games as a child but it got stolen! Thank you for an awesome week and a fantastic run this far!
Come on everyone, we can get this Sonic '06 run!!
HONK-ic 2006
This is for my mother-in-law, who passed away from cancer five years ago, and my father-in-law, who has had terminal cancer for over a decade and despite everything is still fighting. Good luck to the runners and punch cancer in the face!
My dad just finished his last round of Chemotherapy. Here's some cash towards preventing future first rounds.
I've been feeling congested recently, think I might have honkitis

Greetings from Aersia! Let's bust the barrels of cancer!
Work once again prevents me from catching the Sonic block live, but at least I get to see some good DKC runs.
'Honk' is nice...but it's no 'Orb'
First we roll deep, then we roll around at the speed of sound. Let's keep the good times rolling with Sonic 06. AGDQ 2020, roll out!
Why do the fireballs in Krack Shot Kroc look like Cheetos Puffs? They look incredibly delicious, why don't you feed Squitter? :(

Let's do it again!
Enjoying the run first thing in the morning. Good luck in the Lost world and hopefully no deaths.
Thank you for running one of the first games I ever completed 103%! Thank you for ten years of awesome games and for fielding all of these comments and donations! KEEP. ROLLING. DEEP.

I say unto you: HONK!
The first time I've been able to donate to a GDQ, I always love watching. Thanks to all the gamers for running.
First of many. I always look forward to GDQ and basking in the glory of some tight runs! In memory of Bevy - every year brings us closer to finishing this fight. Rock on.
Listening to the stream on my phone at work and it's just not the same. Oh well need to work to donate.Good luck in HONKey Kong.
Loving this dkc3 run!
No MSG Sonic Run? I Ike MSG tho.
My aunt just lost her boyfriend to throat cancer this past November, my financial situation doesn't allow me to give much but here is 5 dollars towards nobody having to lose a loved one to cancer
For my beautiful aunt who passed from cancer- so happy to donate to this cause and see all of these gamers come together for an event like this!
Good luck ! #Tempetedesang
Need more Sonic 06 in my life.
We need the Sonic '06 speed run! Also if my brother is watching, hi Pete!
Good look on the run vo0id looking nice so far...also i guess sonic roles deep too so...put my money on the sonic 2006 bonus game. Thanks for all the work behind the scenes :)
This donation will not get me a tax refunded and that is how it should be!
You know why I did this...
As always, a great opening. Let's smash/crush/destroy last years record. Can you say "$4million HYYPE!!"???
Let's get that Sonic 06 run going
Sonic '06 let's goooooooo
Sonic the Hedgehog, you can't catch what you can't see!
Used to play this game with my brother when we were kids. Watching this makes me so happy! Keep up the good work.
I'm down with the flu so GDQ is just what I needed. Shout out to my friend Zack and the awesome dancers in front row. Hyyyype!
Thanks to everyone who makes GDQ possible, y’all are awesome! Shoutouts to v0oid, good luck with the rest of the run! Donation goes to runner’s choice.
I love Donkey Kong Country 3! This game was my jam back in the day. I am an oncology nurse and I see my patients and their families go through really tough times. Just doing my part to help end cancer and take care of those who have it until we do!
One of my favorite games from my childhood—and adulthood! Shout-out to games that break the rules of percentages.
Good Luck!
It's the most wonderful HONK! If the year!!!! I do miss Ooooorrrrrrrbbbb though.... Can we get an Orb from the everyone???
I hope my donation to Sonic 06 Silver's run won't be of "no use"
So fun fact: This game actually comes full circle in a way when it comes to K. Rool. In DKC 1 King K. Rool is on a PIRATE ship. ...in DKC 2, CAPTAIN K. Rool is held up on a flying ship that looks like it was designed by a mad scientist....but in DKC3, the mad scientist Baron K. Roolestien is held up in a castle....fit for a KING.Rather interesting, if you think about it!
Lots of memories of playing DKC3 as a kid with my cousin! Good luck and have fun to all runners! Please put this towards the Sonic 06 incentive!
Watching the stream while lesson planning for the upcoming week! I love watching this event with my husband, and I wanted to donate for him since he's stuck at a training and can't sneak a peek to catch a fave game of his. Love you Pharamos!
Hey All, Yetee here! This DKC3 run is too wild! Wanted to show some love for our favorite animal buddy, Honk, The Goose! HONK!
I've been watching AGDQ since it began. I've never had the money to donate until now. I want to thank all the runners and all the generous people who decided to donate. I lost my mom to ovarian cancer. I've spent all of my adult life serving this country in the Army and now in my state's State Police. Let's do whatever we can to get this solved and prevent cancer from taking another life. Also, Dog better not die in any of the Fallout games!
Let's hit 200k!!
#kongdidnothingwrong GOTCHA HAHA
why must you make me suffer
Now that I'm gainfully employed, I can donate to AGDQ! Let's get that Bayo 2 incentive!
A very meaningful game to me personally. Enjoying the stream.
HYYYYYYPPPPPEEEEEE!
BIG Kremling ENERGY
Hello GDQ from the Silly Hat Crew. Just helping out and trying to say hi to my other friend at work who is also watching two cubicles over. ..... Honk.
@demonsmallz
10 dollars for 10 years of GDQ. Bank rolling deeply important cancer research!
Enjoying this DKC3 run! Here's 20 towards Sonic 06 and #Dixie4SmashBros
Finally made it to a GDQ in person. Putting this towards the 2006 Sonic bonus game for my buddy who is here with me and wants to see it happen. Almost there!
Drawing while watching agdq on the last day of winter break = greatness
Lost my grandmother to cancer last year. I've been following GDQ for years but never had a chance to donate.
Alright, I brushed my teeth, ate my vegetables and donated for Sonic 06!Have fun with sonic colours cyd! Looking forward to an amazing sonic block!
ITS NO USE
I'm not sure "I want to see Sonic 06" is exactly how I'd phrase it, but it's for a good cause. Good luck to all the runners!
Thank you to everyone who makes this event possible and for helping raise money for a great cause. Save the frames, kill the cancer.
Me and the missus usually watch GDQ in separate countries but actually managed to watch together this year. Happy birthday to you my smoochling and grats to GDQ for 10 years!
AGDQ is live? NOW I know the year has actually started!Good luck and few frames to all the runners!
greetings from spain, donating in sonic block because it´s the saga that defined my life (born same year) "Feliz décimo aniversario" and the honk be with you
donating for the best Sonic game, Sonic '06
Lets see that glorious dumpster fire that is Sonic 06.
Long time watcher first time donater! I love GDQ so much and am finally in a good spot to donate. Money goes to Sonic 06!
Step 1 from 4
I need Sonic '06 to happen.
It is not for us to decide whether Sonic 06 will be run. The decision was made a long time ago. We can only accept our fate.
Long-time watcher, first time donator. This event has given me life for so many years and, now that I finally can, I want to donate to support everything you guys are doing! Keep it going strong and let's get the best game of all time into this event! Can we get some Sonic 06 hype?!
I played Sonic 06, so now you all have to watch it.
My most anticipated event every year. Cannot wait to see what type of highlights we get this time. Save the frames!
Let's make Sonic '06 happen!
Step 2 of 4
Leaving 06 dollars for Sonic 06!
Give me that sweet, sweet Sonic '06 to cap off this block. Sonic is the definition of speedrunning.
Dropping this to make the Sonic '06 run happen. Let's go!
Wecome to hell, Honk!
Attention. Would the owner of a white hovercar shaped like an egg please report to the front desk -- your vehicle has been broken into. Again, would the owner of a white hovercar shaped like an egg...hey, wait a minute!
Sonic 06 HYPE!!!
GOTTA HONK FAST
Step 3 of 4
Step 4 of 4
It's 2020 my dude
I wanted to get a donation in while Lizstar was hosting. You do a lot for your little corner of the internet and we all love you! Good luck on your runs later this week! Donation goes toward your choice!
I can't count ... so there's another one :)
I totally forgot AGDQ was happening this week! Glad I checked in on you guys, so I can finally witness this event live for the first time (and give some dollars)! This is probably one of my many donations coming in this week, as my gran unfortunately died of cancer a few years back and I want to give back to the community. Let's kick some cancer butt! Lots of love from the Netherlands <3
I always love charity esport / gaming streams. They go such a long way to make esports get taken seriously AND they help a different good cause on top. Please continue doing this great work every year!
Gotta donate for Sonic block!Thanks for putting on an amazing event for a great cause
Woohoo! Awesome talk from an awesome lady. Appreciate raising awareness, as I lost my grandma to ovarian cancer early last year.
Bonsoir tout le monde ! Ceci est un petit message. Voila. Des bisous =) #DarkMageHi everyone ! This is just a little message. That it. Kiss =)
Just showing my support for talking about womens healthcare for cancer prevention! These talks are very influential for the audience and while they may be unusual now, making them a conversation that people now feel more comfortable having from being exposed to it is very important! Thank you.
Kirbymastah here. Sad I couldn't make it to AGDQ in person for the sonic block, especially to catch my one contribution to colors speedrunning by being bad at the game. I'll donate another $20 if cyd nails the asteroid coaster boss's frame perfect rocket! This donation goes to Cyd's choice. Good luck to cyd and all our fellow sonic nerds!
Happy to support this event and cause.
Combattons ensemble contre le cancer.Force et courage à tous.Et surtout bourrez les dons pour Pif le chien !#LonaLink
Hedgehog or sun dog, both are good. Good luck Cyd!
I look forward to the Sonic and Fallout speedruns every year! So happy to see my current obsession The Outer Worlds is being run as well!!! Thanks for all the hard work!
Good luck to all the Sonic Block Runners today!
Hey there AGDQ!First time ever donating!I've been a huge Sonic fan for as long as I can remember and when I came across Cyd's name on the runner list I just had to donate, I mean, we're fellow Dutchies after all! My donation also goes to the Sonic 06 run! Greetings from the Netherlands and don't forget, no copyright law in the universe is going to stop Sonic!
Can’t believe this has been going for 10 years now, all the amazing runners running 100s of amazing games is inspiring, making me have a little bit more faith in humanity. Donating during my favourite franchise of all time, thank you for 10 long years, here’s to 10 more :3
Une super semaine en prévision. On lâche rien pour la Prévention contre le cancer. Tout don est bon à prendre :) On continue aussi pour Pif, celui-là on l'aura ! #CoeurNoir
Sanic ought six!!
Thanks so much for all GDQ's work in fighting cancer and spreading the good word of speedrunning. Here's to seeing the "Bad End" of Outer Worlds!
Gotta go fast!
You got this Cyd!! gdqFAST Shoutout to my mom, who's getting a mastectomy later this month. Thanks, GDQ!
50 a day for a great agdq

Un don pour la recherche pour un fléau qui a fait que j'ai perdu mes 2 grands-parents maternels. J'espère que la recherche nous permettra de le vaincre! Merci aux commentateurs et à toute l'équipe du French Restream pour c'est commentaire et ce travail de qualité! Et vive Pif! #GDQup
No copyright law in the universe can stop me from going fast! Love and Chaos Emeralds from Discord HQ, let's save some lives!
Waking up at 6:30, commuting, working, commuting, cooking, eating, washing dishes. And I'm done just in time for the Sonic block! This is going to be great. Sonic is a highlight of every GDQ. Good luck to all the runners.
GOOD.. GREAT... AWESOME... OUTSTANDING... AMAZING!!! Keep up the good work, gotta go FAST!
Hey Cyd and everyone else, Sparanda here! Looking forward to the Egg Shuttle run!
IT’S MY BIRTHDAY! Guess how old I am! I can’t imagine a better way to spend my birthday than finally attending AGDQ! Let’s kick cancer’s butt! PS: I love Sonic 06! It’s so bad it’s good!
#CoeurBleu encore merci pour tous se que vous faites vous êtes géniaux
Hey Cyd! Awesome to see you at GDQ again! Good luck with the colours run! Also good luck to all the other runners and shoutouts to my girlfriend Cindy who's sitting in the crowd! I love you!

I wish could see this run, but unfortunately I am colour blind... :p
HYPE FOR $200,000! Can we see $300,000 by the end of the day? I think we can. Thank you to all the staff and volunteers at AGDQ 2020!
Shout out to SatAM!
First time watching GDQ and first time donating. Had to donate during the Sonic block, the Megadrive Sonic games are among my favorite games of all time. Looking forward to the Sonic 3 & Knuckles run. Good luck to the runners and thanks to everybody for making this possible.
Sad to see no Ristar run this time around, but hey, Lizstar is on the mic, and Sonic Colours is basically a Ristar knock-off anyway (you try telling me Cyan Laser isn't a total ripoff of the Meteor Strike) so this is close enough for my obligatory "it's wrist-star not rye-star" donation. Good luck to all the runners.
The sonic block is always my favorite! Good luck everyone!
Here's to my fellow dutchie! Je moet snel gaan!
Got to donate during the Sonic block! I've heard about how broken Colors has become, so I was very excited to see this! Good luck on the run!
Thanks to a certain untitled game, we finally know what Sonic is running from.Honk!Greetings from Germany.
Love watching AGDQ and am always happy to help
Watching here at work and letting my customers experience the magic of speed running for charity. Dont forget to go fast for Sonic and Rickey Bobby
Good luck to Cyd, and our favorite blue boy, Blue Cube wisp! Show the world how great and blue he is!
Gotta go, bro!
I always look forward to the Sonic Block at GDQ. Good luck to Cyd and all the Sonic Runners today! CatBoo
They call me Segastar so of course I have to watch the block in person. Good luck to all runners!
Hi AGDQ ! Thanks for the show and this awesome Sonic Colours run, Cyd/o/
Gotta go fast is a bit of an understatement for sonic speedruns. Gotta break fast?Good luck runners during the sonic block!
Glad for my first chance to attend AGDQ, everyone has been so wonderful! Also, 200,000 HYYYYPE!!!!!
Gotta go fast!!
Had to make my donation during a run of one of my favorite games of all time from my gaming gaming franchise. A big thank you to all the runners, commentators, crowd, donors, and behind-the-scene workers who make this event possible. I'm happy to be able to contribute to such a wonderful cause, and hope this event continues to help others for years to come.Putting this towards the Bayonetta 2 incentive; hope everyone enjoys the rest of the event, and good luck to all of the runners!
This is for Sherbear

Gotta go H O N K
Watching the Sonic block from the crowd with my partner and my brother at our first-ever AGDQ! This community is awesome! Thanks to the runners for blowing my mind with these Sonic games I love so well - best of luck and have fun! HONK!!!
Hello GDQ. Long time watcher, first time donor. Thank you to all people involved in these events. My grandfather lost his battle with cancer this past september after 7 years, so this donation is dedicated to his memory. Hopefully we will soon be able to speedrun cancer treatment to the point where people will not need to fight cancer in their 80s like grandpa did.
Great to see a fellow Dutchman at GDQ (there's no mistaking that accent), and playing my favorite Sonic game too! Best of luck to CriticalCyd, and greetings from Groningen.
I'm the Knight of the Wind
Had to donate during Sonic Colors run since it was the first sonic game I ever played.
Thank you to all the runners for supporting such an amazing cause!
Really looking forward to Fallout Anthology, The Outer Worlds, and all the DOOM games! Good luck to all of the runners and a huge thanks to everyone involved, this year is shaping up to be amazing as always. Can I get a HYPE! from the audience?
My own mother is a cancer survivor, and my mother-in-law is currently suffering from the disease herself. Thank you so much to the runners, organizers, and Prevent Cancer Foundation for making this event happen. It's always a highlight of my year, and it means a lot to have the community come together for a great cause.
GOTTA GO... HONKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!
couldn't stop me from donating during sonic block good lcuk for cyd with doing those amazing 3d in 2d glitches and also good luck for all other runners. gotta go faaaaaaaaaaaaast!!!!!!!
GO FAST
Another year, another Sonic block. Gotta donate fast!
Bonne chance aux runners et bon courage aux commentateurs ! #EniCeleste
Never seen a Sonic Colors run before, but this is looking pretty impressive! This was the first Sonic game I ever played, so it's cool to see this from a new perspective. The only bad part about zooming through these levels so fast is that we miss out on getting to listen to this awesome soundtrack.Best of luck to all the runners! Put this towards runner's choice.
This Sonic Colours run is incredible. I am in utter awe at Sonic in his element! Can't wait to see the rest of the Sonic block.
The mighty ocean! Cradle of life! Trivialized for your amusement at Eggman’s Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park.
We know they look delicious, but please refrain from licking the rides. That would be disgusting. Do you know where those rides have been? People have been sitting on those rides. With their BUTTS! Okay, go ahead. Lick them. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
Petit fail sur l'incentive, cette fois je me loupe pas. x) L'insomnie déjà commencer pour moi. Et c'est que le début !
You mean I can add an incentive towards a FF8 song played live on stream... Yes Please! Chat is cute <3
I won't be able to watch the DOOM run tonight, but wanted to make sure I donated! For Bloodlust on Kromcrush!
The GDQ marathons are one of my favorite events in the year, thank you for all you guys do to raise money for charity!
This is for my friend Danielle, who beat non-hodgkin's lymphoma and just hit her 5 year mark for being cancer free. Donating during Sonic block in honor of all the sonic we played together!
First time donator! just wanted to donate during my favorite speedrun of sonic colors
Hello from the front row! This is my first time attending a GDQ in person and I can tell you folks at home, the hype is AMPLIFIED here. Your screen does not do this any justice. Glad to have made the trip from Canada to see friends, runners... and the Dancing Dad up front!Money goes the Punch-Out blindfold run. From the sound of it, it shall be awesomeHONK!
It is, in fact, of some use!
So happy it is time for AGDQ again! Had to donate in the Sonic block because this was the first video game series I got into as a kid. Gotta go fast!
gamers game games game games gamers
I'm not quick enough to come up with any puns. I don't have the hedgehog's sharp wit.
I'm donating in honor of my nephew, Aiden, who has been fighting cancer for 3 years. He loves Puyo Puyo and Sonic the Hedgehog (and even just got a "Sanic" t-shirt), and he delights all the hospital staff with his cute stuffed animals, I Spy clues, and donations of video games for other sick kids. I know that he doesn't want anyone else to go through a fight like his, so I'm donating to help stop cancer before it starts. Gotta beat cancer fast! Much love to you all, GDQ. It would make my nephew so happy if the crowd would say, "Go Aiden!"
Frame Perfect Tricks? I got the other 20$ to make it 40$ if CYD makes it!
Keeping with my New Year Resolution of trying to put a little bit of money towards a good cause.
malgrug will donate in the name of his guild Bloodlust. we speedrun ragnaros every week and we will speedrun a cur for cancer as well.
It's no use! Take this money!
Extremely excited to watch TomatoAngus breeze through the Fallout Anthology at AGDQ2020. Honk
Someone hug cyd instead of me. Who am I? I am thebluemania.
#GDQupIl manquait pas grand chose ! Gardez la pèche et la tête de l'incentive !
The Sonic Colors soundtrack always cheers me up when I'm feeling down. Keep going fast and wishing everyone a great 2020! <3
This is my first time donating to a GDQ event! All these “honks” going on throughout the marathon are really reminding me of Homestuck. Did you know there’s a Homestuck 2 now? Anyways, I’m loving all these runs and want to say good luck to all the runners!
First time attending great to see these runs in person.
So bizarre hearing Liz commentate SNES runs. That's the wrong side of the console war! Thankfully, it's Sonic block now, and all is right with the world.
Excellent Colours run, glad to see this underrated gem get time in the spotlight! Putting this towards naming the Wingull " Bees?" because BEEEEES.
Hello! First time donating, been watching since 2018. I love this event, and now that I have a few savings, I had to donate during the Sonic block, I love Sonic games (Specially the classic ones) since I was a kid <3 Good luck to all the runners! Greetings from Spain :D
Sonic. Block. HYPE!!
Let's K.O. cancer with this Punch-Out run!
Loving the Sonic block, keep up the good work! Don’t forget, you gotta...go...something.
Hey Sonikku, this one's for you. We're all cheering for you in the audience, and I'm so excited you're getting to show your stuff at GDQ. Much luck and love. YOSH!
Recent watcher and recent donator! Been watching since a saw a few runs with friends during AGDQ2019, and now I'm watching the whole thing since the last SGDQ!Nominating Bard for Squall's name in the FFVIII run in honour of my favourite game of all time, Wandersong. In the meantime, I hope you all enjoy the Sonic block!
Such a wonderful event!
Hello from New Zealand - I woke up early for the Sonic block! I was diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2019, so this year's GDQ is closer to my heart than ever. Lots of love to everyone in the industry whose lives have been changed by these diseases. Hey Sega, new Chao Garden when?
Donating for my favorite pair of nerds. Cyd, don't die... again.
"I WANNA GO FAST!!" -RICKY BOBBY
First time donator here. Sonic Colours was one of the first games I got on the Wii and I remember having a blast with it, so it's great to see it here at GDQ!I'll double my donation if the couch does the Final Colour Blaster chant for the final hit of the Egg Nega Wisp Armour. "UNLIMITED COLOURS! LASER! DRILL! SPIKES! ROCKET! CUBE! HOVER! FRENZY! FINAL COLOUR BLASTER!"Make my day, guys. :)
First things first:If this gets read out loud during the Celeste run, i will donate another 25$.Important things last:Hi AGDQ, long time watcher, first time donator! I wanted to say thank you to all the amazing people who made these events possible! Please stay as amazing as you are! Also i wanted to give a shoutout to all the awesome girls and boys from LPIP! May the peppermint be with you! Good luck to all the runners and donation goes to runners choice :)
Keep up the good runs and side with Phineas! Want to see Tartarus speed run!
Love this game! My best friend was fortunate enough to beat cancer at the age of eight years old, but this donation goes out to all the people who weren't so lucky. Let's kick cancer's butt!!
greetings from spain, the dr. robotnik in the crowd get up and say "HONK"
This is my first time watching GDQ live even though I've watched VODs for years. Cheers to this great run and my favorite video game character as a kid. Let's beat cancer.
Gros soutien et courage à tout ceux qui se battent contre cette maladie ! #GDQup
I met my oldest friend through being Sonic fans way back in 2002. Her mother passed away from cancer in 2019. I'm pretty she's watching the Sonic block at work, so hey: love you, Jeni.
I've been watching Games Done Quick for years, but never had the money to donate. Now that I do, I wanted to donate during the Sonic block, because Sonic has a special place in my heart for being the first game I ever played. So many good memories. Thank you guys for doing what you do, let's stick it to cancer. Money goes to Punch Out 2p1c blindfolded bonus game, the more GDQ the better!
Hey there, I just had to drop a donation in for the run of my favourite Mega Drive-era Sonic game! Proud of all the work you're doing to prevent cancer, given my dad was diagnosed a few years back and was successfully treated for it. Keep up the great work, and I might see if I can spare a little more either during the Pokémon Sapphire run, or if you go for a Good Future!
We need punch out! Instead of joining the Nintendo fun club, I'll put my money to helping fight cancer!
Shout out to the dancing peeps in the audience, keep it groovin!
HONK
I love me some Sanic the Hotdog!
HONK
There's nothing like GDQ to help Mondays go by a little bit faster!
My grandfather passed from lung cancer a few years ago, so along with my appreciation of speedrunning and retro games, I am very happy to donate today. Keep doing what you're doing!
Have to donate during my favorite Block. Sonic was a inspiration during my childhood and has continued to be 'Way Past Cool.'
Let’s go Sornic
Had to donate in honor of those awesome Sonic 3D Blast tunes. Thanks for keeping me entertained at work!
gosh i cant believe i finally caught a GDQ! of course i have to donate at least a bit since i FINALLY caught it, so JP soundtrack for Sonic CD it is! thank you for all you do!
Go Fast
Have to donate during the sonic block for EGGMAN running around AGDQ - PLease make him do the countdown for a Sonic 06 start game. or any sonic game
Gotta go fast!
It's no use! Take THIS! It's no use! Take THIS! It's no use! Take THIS!
My buddy just beat cancer at 23. Really appreciate this thing guys!
I am so happy to see another year of speed runs and generous donations. Have fun, runners!
Zapp and Sun for outer worlds
Gotta go fast!
How could I not donate during sonic block?! Favourite game for the last three decades!! Good luck to all the runners, you guys are awesome!
sonic 06 was my introduction to GDQ. glad to see it again.
My mom is a two time cancer survivor and introduced me to games with Sonic. Would be a shame not to donate! My money goes to the scary US sonic CD boss music.
Gotta go fast! Thanks so much to all the runners, support personnel, and everyone involved for putting on my favorite gaming event of the year. Let's beat cancer together!
8ème année que je regarde et premier don pour cette 10ème année !Bravo tout le monde !
First time donation but we lost a good colleague to cancer two days ago...! I just had to donate. Thank you all so much for doing something against this terrible sickness!
Just a quick anti-snipe measure for Sonic CD ;)
Bonne AGDQ à tous! Merci aux commentateurs/ambianceurs.Go Pif! #MarioLight
Unite, Game and lets defeat cancer. :D
That throw pillow is too excellent to not donate. Good luck to all the runners!
why no love for US soundtrack?
Legally Distinct Blue Donation
Donation + Donation = good help,,,, quick math ting skrrra
One month ago we got the horrible news that my mom has lung cancer. Her condition went down incredibly fast and she passed away less than 3 weeks later on December 21st. She was only 58 years old. Nobody deserves this. I am grateful for everything AGDQ does for Prevent Cancer. Sonic the Hedgehog was my entire childhood and my mom would always get me everything Sonic related I wanted. She was a great mother and it's thanks to her that I am the way I am now. Good luck to everyone at AGDQ and especially those who are playing the blue blur's games :)
I really want that fast rodent pillow. I need it in my life.
Gotta go fast
no comment here
Hey gang, it's the CEO of Sonic CD here. Good luck on the run and let's destroy cancer. Did you know that in an early prototype build of Sonic CD Palmtree Panic was named Salad Plain
Good games for a good cause. This comes with love from your friends at AJRPG.
IT'SNOUSE! GREATGREATGREAT! The JP OST in CD is superior so my donation goes to that! Go fast, my friends.
Hey guys wish I could have been there to see you all race live but I'm excited to meet up with you guys when I get there tomorrow! I'd donate to the JP OST incentive, but it looks like more then enough people have donated to the better choice anyways so I'll just put my 10.00 to naming Wingull in Pokemon Saphirre 10.00. From one CD runner to another, good luck to all of you~
First donation of the event. Can't wait to see the 100% Doom 2016 run! Thanks to everyone involved.
DE/GER Good Sonic Speed-Run! Thanks for that.For the german Stream:Ihr brennt ein Feuerwehr ab. Weiter so!! :D
Greeting from the crowd! It's my first GDQ event in person. Sonic makes for great speedruns because it doesn't get much better than going fast while trying to go fast.
I need that fast blue rodent throw pillow. i NEED it
Hey finalflame, your old friend Ben here. Just want to advise you while you play Sonic CD to avoid going into a *Tails* spin.
Always great to watch some games be completely broken for our speedrunning needs. Good luck to all the runners and WOO charity!
As a SEGA Employee I have to donate, like every GDQ, during the sonic block.
Salut à toute l'équipe et aux visionneurs. Bon courage, et mettons plein de noms pertinents et originaux pour les défis. #GDQup

Cancer bad. Games good. Going fast better.
Hello from the UK! First time donating and watching GDQ properly. I'm a nurse and see people suffering with cancer daily, so this GDQ is close to my heart.
I NEED that generic blue rodent pillow. My life depends on it. Don't ask why.
The Sonic block is always my favorite! I hope all our runners are able to "Knuckles" down and go fast to get those rings to cancel cancer. Thanks to all the staff who help out! It wouldn't be the same without you!
AQDQ, Is here again providing a week packed with quality Entertainment.Thanks to the Staff and Runners.
Campus Cards and Games here - we're a local hobby shop in Orlando! We always look forward to watching these events, and are excited to live stream the event all week in-store.Thanks so much for everything you do, and IT'S NO USE!(If you're able to read this during the Sonic '06 event, we'd be thrilled <3)
So hyped for the Fallout Anthology!
HONK
My second GDQ, and my first AGDQ. This is my first donation of the event, but hopefully won't be my last. Super onboard for that Sonic 06 HYPE
Sonic: He can really move! Sonic: He's got an attitude! Sonic: He's the fastest thing alive! Or he would be, if not for all of these amazing speedrunners! Here's to leaving cancer in the dust!
I've never donated with a prize in mind before, but that pillow is just way too good to miss. Gotta go fa--I mean, gotta go at a totally normal hedgehog speed!
Been watching the VODs for a while, but this is one of the first times I’ve caught the streams live and can donate so had to do so in the Sonic block for the best broken game I (sadly) grew up with - It’s no use!
First time donating and of course its for my favorite blue boy. Excited for the rest of the block. Lets go fast!
Good luck to Flying_Fox in the sonic CD run!
It's almost harvesting season!
Shoutouts to the music mix between games and whoever compiled it, great tunes year after year!
These donations are going at sonic speeds!
Cybernetic ranger is a game
OMG i want that Sonic pillow !!!
This is for my brother, who beat heart cancer in 2011, my username is an homage to his, which was Bulbasaurus Rex.
I am a long time watcher of GDQ but this is a particularly poignant year as I was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in February 2019 and am still being treated for it.I just wanted to say how inspired I am by the speed running community and for the human endeavour you all display. Thanks also to the doctors and scientists who are making it possible to defeat cancer.
Sonic Block, then Fallout and Outer Worlds? Well, good thing I had no plans.
Donating to help a good cause and in the hope of winning the Obviously Legally Distinct Blue Hedgehog Throw Pillow.
Big thanks to everyone who helps put on such and awesome event for a good cause, good luck to all the runners!
A part of my family had to suffer from cancer and some lost the fight. This donation shall help to get rid of this terrible disease.
I'm so happy that I'm able to donate to GDQ this year! You guys are doing great things. Good luck to all the runners! And thank you microphone man for reading donations!

Laid up sick on the couch for the last 4 days... at least it happened after Christmas break and during a GDQ live event. My first time watching live and donating, what you guys do is simply amazing – it's like the Olympics of gaming but instead of awarding medals, you're saving lives. Shout out to the stellar crew behind the scenes, the audience, and all the awesome speedrunners. HYPE!!!
How much hedge could a hedgehog hedge if a hedgehog could hedge fast?
Join us. Embrace your inner Dance. Dance Dad is Legion.
Nobody's sniping the Sonic CD music bid on my watch! Japanese soundtrack, please!
Sonic 06 was one of the first runs I ever saw back during SGDQ 2016, so I had to donate for that. Also I NEED THAT YOSHI COIN

Hey AGDQ! Just thanking everyone for participating in such a wonderful event for a great cause. You're doing a fantastic job. Especially you, Lizstar! Donation goes to JP Soundtrack for Sonic CD because I can't let you apply it to the US Soundtrack.
Shout out to the "unofficial, official AGDQ dancers" in the front row! Y'all make me smile between every run. I'm so glad you made it to Orlando! Can I get a "unofficial, official AGDQ dancers" HYPE train going? $5 per dancer! Choo Choo!!!

Donating while Lizstar is on the mic, Amber is on the couch, and flying fox is on stream. Greetings from the Frame Fatales discord!Yeah... That's all I got. My money's on fox, so donation goes to her choice.
Greetings esteemed guests. I am enjoying this Sonic block a lot, and look forward to seeing Sonic 06. Since Eggman is going to be defeated a lot, let him decide where this money goes. Keep on grooving all.
Gotta keep the meme going and add ARBYS as an option to every name bid that's currently up
Thanks for introducing me to these so-called 'video games'. I'll be checking them out for sure!
Had to donate during the Sonic Block to honor one of my favorite video game characters, and my mom who got me my Sega Genesis to get my into Sonic. Here’s to the game that made me want a Sega CD!
Hey GDQ, long time memer first time spammer! Had to donate during my least favorite game, Sonic CD 201! It feels great to watch FinalFlame, FlyingFox and Sonikkustar totally destroy this awful run! I’ll donate an extra 5$ if everyone on the couch says CD93 is better! Greetings from England!
Lonnie is the best.
My first game was Sonic 2 on the Megadrive.. erhm Genesis, so of course I had to donate for this block!
For my sister. We miss you
Cancer's affected everyone I know. Thank you all for doing what you do. Gotta go honk!
Lost my grandmother to breast cancer a few years ago. Looking forward to the day that no one has to experience that ever again. GDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation are great organizations for working towards that, as well!
VRISKA
Hey all! Sonic CD is one of my favorite 2D Sonic's; 2nd time seeing a run of this and so far it's looking incredible. Shoutouts to the couch commentary and the Sonic Soeedrunning community!
Love the Sonic block. Friend of mine had cancer last year so the money couldn't go to a better cause! Lets get Kyogre nicknamed Magikarp!
Griffin McElroy, if you can hear me, donate to name winggull after your beautiful child, sea breeze.
Keep up the good work AGSQ !!!
I've played all of the Sonic games except Unleashed, Colors, and '06; CD is still my favorite! I'm glad it's not on the .... TAILS end of the block, or I may have missed it.
My wife surprised me with the trip down here to AGDQ and we are sitting in the crowd. Let’s beat cancer!!
Who is this Eggman you speak of? Is he one of Dr. Robotnik's henchmen?
Vriska did nothing wrong.
Toujours un bonheur de suivre cet événement et de contribuer à cette cause ! Merci à tous !!! #CoeurBleu
A shoutouts to everybody working behind the scenes to keep everything up and running! Thank you all so much!
Been watching AGDQ since summer 2015, first time donating. Always amazing to see these events and the communities behind them come together to support such a great cause. Game on, my dudes. And don't forget: HONK!
Good luck, runners! Gotta go fast! 🦊
hOnK :o)
Finally I'm able to donate :) Glad people like you exist so this event can happen every year!
Read Homestuck!
"Eyes On Me" always makes me cry.Make me cry, GDQ.
i love sonic, i grew up watching my big brother play these games until i was big enough to play them myself. now i always get nostalgic when listening to the soundtrack or playing one of these games. thank you for this great event, it always is so much fun to watch!
Its always a lot of fun watching you guys and hearing you talk about the games. Thanks for hosting!
5 dollar today again for the 5 dollar train...choo choo!
What does the fox say? HONK.
Hey all, my grandpa got diagnosed with cancer last year and it's breaking my entire family apart since he doesn't have much time left. I was jobless for months and just got hired at a new place, so I don't have much to donate. This is my first time donating after watching for 4 years and I had to do it during the sonic block because I LOVE sonic. Thanks for everything GDQ does and for everyone who donates. Donate fast, run fast!
Zap to the extreme!
Prizes?
Save the animals, you monsters! Also, HONK
Loving the Sonic runs. Thought I would put my money towards Pokémon being dominated by DIO. Let Dio help prevent cancer!
Hey everyone, sorry I couldn't be there to hang out and help commentate. Real life sucks sometimes. Shoutouts to void, cyd and the CD gang for some excellent runs today (and amber for holding down CD commentary). Hopefully S3K treats zax and joey better than it treats me when I run it. I'll be running along at home, so we'll see how many times I get destroyed by the game...
must go at an above average speed. Sonic 06 HYPE
Pour la postérité
You guys are da best. Keep up the awesome work! And remember, I before E, except after HONK!
Great race on Sonic CD! Looking forward to the Mega Man relay race later this week!

Loving the Sonic Block! Remember you gotta go fast, move quickly, make haste, accelerate at high velocity, generously progress at an appropriate speed relative to the situation, and ...um... just.... just run.
it is my birthday so i am feeling generous
Vous éte beau !
Hey GDQ! Chrezm here! Amazing Sonic block so far, can't wait to see my boys joey and zaxon kill Sonic 3 & Knuckles. These two have pushed this game beyond anything anyone could have imagined in the past year, and their constant dedication to proving the impossible possible shows here. I can say for everyone in the Sonic 3 & Knuckles community that this will be an amazing race. May everything go... AsIntended!
SANIC
Bonne année et bonne GDQ à tous ʕ •ᴥ• ʔ
Samus's power armor is the best power armor.
So excited for the Sonic 3 & Knuckles run as I played this game a lot as a kid. My grandpa passed away from cancer this last February and I’m hoping we can see cancer put to rest and see great people like my grandpa was be cured from this terrible disease
GO GDC!
Awesome event and awesome runs. Keep the good work and OOOOOOORB
Greetings from England. Unable to watch AGDQ at the moment due to being stuck at work but am looking forward to watching back the Sonic block when I get home. Sonic HYPE
The thing that always baffles me about AGDQ is how you can all wear shorts in January! It's freezing where I am!Have a good one, everybody!
S3&K was my jam back in the day, I'm thrilled to see what's in store for it!
Gotta donate fast!Puns aside, I really had to donate durning the FASTEST block of AGDQ. You people make it look so easy, awesome work!
5 bucks for GDQ Dance dad and crew. You guys rock!

Why do we not hear ORB anymore? Because someone honked it.
Let's be excellent to each other!
Go DOOOOOMGo BUCKETHEAD
In loving memory of my grandmother, taken by cancer 20ish years ago. The original Sonic the Hedgehog was her favorite game and she'd be proud of what th series was helping to accomplish.
Cancer can suck it!
I lost my mom to brain cancer a week ago, so what you're doing, raising money for such a good cause, and having (and providing) fun while doing it, means a lot. Keep on the good work!
Enter Comment Here
Don’t think! Don’t blink! Just go go go go gogogogogogo! Putting my donation for the next bonus game.
Just a small donation to say Happy Birthday to my husband. No better way to celebrate than with AGDQ!
Danny Kroese i know youre watching this time to donate friend, greetings from holland
Honk if you’ve got hype!
This Sonic block has been pretty great thus far, although... Sonic '06, all things considered... well, no matter. Best of luck on the runs. Let's see Super Castlevania IV Hard Mode get met.
I'm loving all the dancing in the audience this year. What a great way to celebrate 10 years of good games and good deeds for charity. Honk!
It's hammer time!

Bonjour Aelthan comment vas-tu ? #GDQup
First time watching live, but have followed gdq for a few years. So, retroactive donation unlocked. Love everything about this event! Cheers from Hamburg Germany.
Cancer researcher and Sonic superfan here! I'm home from work all week due to surgery, so thanks for keeping cancer in check while I'm out of the office! Go fast, don't for, & Knuckles!
My Dad got me a genesis for my 4th birthday, and playing it (especially the classic Sonic games) became part of my childhood. My stepmom just got diagnosed with breast cancer, so here’s to her, GDQ, and the PCF.
I just want to do a shout out to my boy Bruce who inspired me to be a part of the Sonic Speed Run community and made this donation possible. Can I get a honk?
hey zaxon and joey!doesn't it feel SUPER to be racing at AGDQ? just think, both of your TAILS of running s3k led to this point.can't wait to watch this CHAOS of a race. much love to you both and all the runners at the event. you all are so amazing.
Pourquoi la proposition sur Fallout n'a pas été acceptée et c'est encore Honk en tête ? XD #DarkMage
#LonaLink Je ne peu jamais donner je suis votre stream depuis des années un grand merci à votre équipe chaque jour qui passe c'est des heures de sommeil en moins.
Hey all! Long time watcher, first time donator. Wasn't sure if I could donate, but then I found out I got accepted to job today! So I thought, why not? This money goes to the sun ending of the outer worlds, cause we all know that it's the Zapp Branigan ending.
I think the front row is playing secretly Just Dance...
Hey Rockruff Hat and Dance Dad, I see you there in the audience and wish I were there partying with you guys like last year. Thanks for keeping the party going!

Bourrez les dons	#EniCeleste
Heard about Eggman and that convinced me to come watch for a while. Big ups to you, dude.
Having lost both my grandads to cancer before I was ever able to meet them, I love all the work that the marathon does every year! Wish I could afford to donate more, this small amount goes to announcer's choice
Did i hear 10$ dancers hype train
I woke up early to catch some of the runs before school and when I come back from school Lizstar is still commentating. Hope you sleep well when you can.
"Bonjour" from France, first time I can give to GDQ, and I'm happy to do it. Happy 10th birthday to all the GDQ community.
Shoutout to nicuveo, and foophoof who might be somewhere in the A/V crew.
I want that pillow.
Had to donate for the Best Blue Boy during Sonic block. Thank you to all the runners, crew, volunteers, and everyone involved in putting on this event. Gotta go fast!
Toss a ring to the hedgehog, oh valley of green hills...
Go runners go!
Greetings from Germany. Seeing what theese runners are capable of always amazes me. My grandfather passed away from cancer, let's help eradicate this disease and watch some great speedruns in the process.
I just can't get enough of fallout anthology runs. I also better make sure we get the true ending in Outer Worlds. Praise the sun.
Hey everyone! Ever since my mother got cured from cancer, I decided to do my best to help as many people as possible get cured too. GDQ is just the perfect occasion for that! Thanks a lot to everyone who is working very hard to make GDQ happen and happy 10th anniversary!Also, shout out to the person on the first row with the Scorbunny hat. I NEED that hat!HOOOOOOOOONK!

Hoping to make it out next year! And remember Don't forget to be Awesome!
GDQ is my favorite time of the year! Here's to another 10 amazing years of speedruns and charity!

Here are some rings to egg on the AGDQ, The Awesome Grooving Dance-Qrew.Also shoutout to Brickroad who's chilling somewhere in the audience.
Still mad that Tails is left off of the title card for this one. Why not Sonic 3 & Knuckles & Tails ?
Kill the animals and save Knuckles!
Keep up the great work!
This is in memory of my father, who we lost to cancer over ten years ago now. He bought me my first console (a Sega Genesis) and got me started gaming. My fondest gaming memory is when he let me stay up late, on a school night even, because I cleared Metropolis zone in Sonic 2 for the first time. So I had to donate during the Sonic block.
I've watched you guys for years. Love what you do for the different charities.
Finally donating to such a great cause, gotta rep my gal Vriska for FFVIII
Hey all! Had to donate for one of my favourite games, Sonic 3 and Knuckles! Good luck to Zaxon and Joey, and shoutouts to the amazing couch of Drakodan, Spike and Supersonic! Cheers!
Win for Violet Moon and vir kid Kat! We love them!
gl joey and zax
Good evening GDQ. My European time difference makes it tough to follow everything live. But great Sonic block. Keep going fast!
Finally its this time of the year again. Good luck to all runners.
Gotta donate during best game of best franchise! Glad my favorite stage ever, Angel Island, somehow remains untainted by glitches. Honk!
Trans rights
Wait, why is Knuckles blue in this game? Good luck Joey and Zaxon!
ANYWAY, STAN VRISKA
Always donate during the Sonic Block. Love the way the runners go fast. Keep it up!
There's an urgency I feel when watching Sonic I can't quite articulate. We need to move ahead with extreme alacrity.We must advance with suitable forward momentum! Feet must raise and lower with great rapidity.We must swiftly travel with promptness and haste!The expeditiousness in which we reach our maximum velocity will further our efforts to reach an immediate in conclusion!Sigh, I wish there was an easier way to say it.
Whoever made the sonic pillow is a god!Gotta go HOOOOONK!
Thanks for all you do! Here's $10 for Sonic to glitch through those frames.
Hello AGDQ. I've been watching GDQ since 2017 and it's all thanks to the man in the hot seat right now. Here's a $75 donation in Joey's name to help the cause even further. Good luck to everyone and give this race a run for it's money.

Supporting a great cause here, lost my dad to cancer last year. Thank you to all the runners and organizers. Much love from Denmark
Hi, Clov here! I've been enjoying the Sonic block so far. Keep going fast and don't forget Knuckles is watching :eyes:P.S.: AsIntended
Sonic and Knuckles was my favorite game growing up and still holds a special place in my heart. Maybe one of these days, we'll actually see a run that uses Knuckles instead of Sonic or Tails... <.<
This speedrun is so impressive and so wild! Both runners are doing amazing jobs! Love, from the crowd
Honking geese are getting all the attention this year, but don't forget that ducks also love Games Done Quack.
Hello! I've never donated before, but I'm a big Sonic fan and so I have to contribute during the Sonic 3 and Knuckles run, which was probably the greatest game of my childhood! Read the Sonic IDE comics!
Big fan of Sonic 3 & Knuckles. You guys are blowing my mind with these glitches! THIS IS AWESOME!
Let's get those millions together, hey?
All this high speed warping..... could this be.... CHAOS CONTROL!?!
Love AGDQ watch it every year. CAN WE GET SOME HYPE FOR ZAXON96 HYPE IF we do will donate another 5 dollars :D GO ZAXON GO
:)
first time donating long time watcher, gl runners :D
Goodluck to FocusSight on his Sonic '06 run! Glad I could tune in from Australia!
Greetings from the 4th row. Today is my best friend's birthday! Guess how old she is? I'm so glad to be attending GDQ for the first time, and glad she could be here with me. Even though, much to my chagrin, she is super excitedly dragging me along to the Sonic '06 run (she loves that game). Let's go fast, and kick Cancer's butt!
Compelled to progress expeditiously
Had to donate during one of my favourite Sonic Games to play. What? Sonic was actually the good guy? OHNO!
Tryin out a new name. What do ya think?
Can I offer you a nice Eggman in this trying time?
IT'S NO USE! TAKE THIS (donation)! Having a blast tuning in this year, and I'm happy to see this beautiful mess of a game on the AGDQ stage. Best of luck to the runner!
Donating ahead of the Fallout speedrun. Good luck, Tomatoangus! Also, rainforest Cafe, if you're watching/listening, I only went to your restaurant because of tomatoangus' rave reviews and constant free advertising, rainforest Cafe marketing department, SPONSOR HIM! Thanks!
Come on Zaxon you got this donk boy!
Bonsoir à tous, que les dons et les belles runs continuent. #PokeLou
Frog Gang
Sonic is so fast wow
And I thought Sonic '06 was broken. Put this towards Joey's choice.
Thank you to all the speedrunners, you're all amazing! S3&K still holds fond memories of my childhood and I remember laughably attempting to "speedrun" this series. Looking forward to Sonic 06 and let's help fight stop cancer!
Didn't expect Sonic to be commentated by a Brit and Tom Hanks. Have a chili dog on me for cancer prevention.
Hey just watching with my soon to be wife!Jessica will you Marry Me??
Here's $10 towards a great cause. I lost my mom to cancer almost 4 years ago and it's time for cancer to get rekt! I hope all the players are having fun and that their runs go well!
Fun fact: "Sonic hedgehog" is the name of an actual human protein, encoded by the "S.H.H." gene, study of which is an active topic in cancer research. Here's hoping our hero can help progress on a cure *go fast*! Thanks to the runners and announcer for such awesome gameplay and commentary.
I love hot dogs.
DGF HHW (<)(<)
I finished Outer World last weekend in preparation to watch it be completely broken today at GDQ! Shoutout to my boyfriend Jack, who introduced me to GDQ years ago. This event and everyone involved is absolutely amazing, and I'm proud to watch and donate every year.
first time donating and first time watching live after hours of watching old gdq's on youtube! much love to all the runners
fst
Let's Go!!!
with love to Glitches-are-cool ❤️
There is only one word to sum up this fantastic event. And it is HONK!
Hey Focus, it's your trunky friend here reminding you to turn off subtitles and voice clips so the game loads quicker! KappaShout-outs to ZZZjpn, here's hoping we can get Unleashed any% at a GDQ at some point
Five years ago, I was preparing to start radiation and chemotherapy. Today, I am cancer free! Thank you to everyone at GDQ for your hard work. I'm so excited for this Sonic 06 run!
Thank you! <3
It's no use!
GOTTA GO QUICK
GDQs are the highlight of my year, and this one is already off to a great start.
In the spirit of the new Sonic movie, how much to get Gangster’s Paradise on repeat throughout the entire Sonic 06 run?
(Yell this please, Liz <3)TRASH FOR THE TRASH GODJUNK FOR THE JUNK THRONE
Greetings from Germany. Thanks for those Sonic runs they are amazing!And i want some WOOOOOOH from the crowd
My mother was just diagnosed with cancer 7 weeks ago, thankfully her treatments have been going well and things are looking good, just doing my share to help so others don't have to deal with cancer
I'm not Awesome Games Done Quick; I'm my original marathon, Blawesome Games Done Quick.
Great games, great cause! Thank you to all that have made this possible year after year!
Me like hedgehog lots. He go fast and he funny.
Dancing Dad, move back to the middle seat, we need you in the spotlight! Don't get pushed off your stage! If I could ever have another dad, it would be you, ya dang handsome dancing man!
Been following GDQ for almost 3 years now and i loved it every time! Big up from Italy!
In honor of Rush being a Good Boy for PJ put this towards PUNCHOUT CO-OP since that was clearly blind luck (the best kind).
I lost my father to cancer last year. The first console my father gave me was the sega genesis with the Sonic games that me and brother played and loved. He would always just sit beside us and enjoy watching us play. He got us both into the joy of gaming and consequently helped me get my future job. The pain of losing my dad still hurts greatly, and I hope the cure for cancer gets found soon so nobody has to go through the same pain I did. Much love to you all.
Day 2! I already don't want the event to end. That was a awesome sonic we witnessed. Can't wait for OuterWorlds later!
i did this for you vriska
Donating in honor of Zax! The subpixels might've done you dirty in front of your squad, but we still have your back. Thanks so much for running for all of us here at home! Donation goes to Zaxon's choice.
To help put an end so the day comes nobody suffers from this again.
I'm sorryDonation goes to runner's choice.
Thanks for everything GDQ does, Sonic is one of my son's favorites and we can't wait to join you all in Orlando later in the week. Gotta go fast!
Best event.
Un grand merci pour votre stream, sincèrement.
That blue rodent pillow is the best thing ever!

Hey Focus, Liam, Wike, and Cyd! Good luck on the run! I will donate $50 more if you can roast Turbo and/or Shadow's story for me.

Hi
Hey Focus Buddy! Your friend Mister Monki here! I told ya you'd be running this today and I know you're gonna do great!Also, I head that Trial Skip had something like 50 frame perfect inputs from your interview, so here's $50! If you pull it off I'll donate another $50!Good Luck!
Sonic 06 was the first Sonic game my friends deigned to introduce me to. Can I get an F from the audience please
Just donating $1 for every time I heard "IT'S NO USE!" when I played Sonic '06 to completion back in 2018. High fives to the runners, commentators, announcers, and everyone in attendance, and thank you SO MUCH for all you do!
IT'S NO GOOSE!!
Sonic the Hedgehog was a massive part of my childhood and so I absolutely had to donate during the Sonic Block, especially during a Sonic 06 speedrun! It amazes me how much more this game can be broken than it already is!

“Ha ha! One!” Donating for the Sonic 06 run, but my donation goes to the Griever incentive for Final Fantasy 8.Let’s name him a name that truly strikes fear into the hearts of millions.Goose. HONK!
Run all the things
Hey everyone, thanks so much for another fantastic AGDQ! Safe to say my productivity at work is basically null this week. But I love to support such a great cause, and looking forward to even more thrilling speedruns throughout the week! HONK!
Skeebledorp is friend, hello.
Sitting here with my wife and our two toddlers watching the runs. Took vacation for the week so we can enjoy as many runs as possible. Hopefully the little ones grow up loving this awesome event and join us in on our tradition of watching every GDQ we can. HONK HYPE
Looking forward to the Sonic 06 run and to watch my favorite runner, good old TomatoAngus, run my favorite anthology. Honk!
Good luck to Tomatoangus on the Fallout Anthology! With the power of your stand, BIG IRON, nothing can defeat you!
I will never forget Tripleagent's [sonic voice]"OKAY! OKAY! This game is OKAY!" from his run a few years ago. Still cracks me up. Good luck to Focussight dealing with Silver; you're a really useful hedgehog! :)
Incredible to be able to see this Fallout series marathon. Thumbs up for the speedrunner and his couch.
I am honored to donate during the run of Sonic 06, a game none of us will ever forget. I can't get Sonic's voice out of my head when he screams, "Elise!!". Also....hey
A good friend of mine died t recently from brain cancer, so this event hits harder than ever. This is for him and a thanks for everyone involved in this great cause. Also, honk.
I'm incredibly lucky in that my father has survived multiple cancer scares, the most recent of which came last year. However, I know there are many people and families out there who aren't so lucky. I'm giving what I can to ensure the dream of a cancer-free world becomes a reality. Good luck to all the runners, you are all far more skilled at video games than I ever could be.
For my Uncle Bubba
My dad died from pancreas cancer about five years ago, at the age of 64. It’s such a hideous disease that affect so many of us. I love it that you guys are doing What you do, putting out a-class entertainment and at the same time helping the cause to fight cancer
Long time viewer, first time donatingI just had to donate for my favourite Sonic game that came out in 2006Good luck to Focus
Sonic '06?!Oh No!
#DarkMageBonne année à tout les runner, à tout les commentateurs et à tout les spectateurs, Nounous (nounours sans le r) vous fait un gros câlin et vous souhaite une très bonne semaine.
Finally seeing GDQ live, and am very happy to see this game again! Great to see another campaign other than Sonic's. Hope everyone has a great time!
What's up GDQ this is my first time donating. Shout out to all the rad people who make all of this possible. And a quick shout out to Dan Ryckert who is a personal hero of mine.
I'm so happy that AGDQ is back! Thanks to everyone that makes this possible and good luck to all the runners. Keep going fast and I'll keep donating during the event. This one goes to the 2p1c blindfolded Punch-Out run.
count how many sand is in this desert, omega
vriska
Focus! Fokasu-kun!!! It's been 4 years. FOUR. YEARS!!! Where did the time go? Gone are the days of Skype calls and Cookie Kiss. Now you're up there on the big stage, running the greatest dumpster fire game of all time. Is this how moms feel when their kids move out?! D: We may not speak much these days, but know your pal Alice is cheering you on from behind the screen. Best of luck on the run dude, give it your all! *Sips Tea* AH! The weather is nice today
Still no donations.
Don't have much to give but I wanna help out. Used to love this game as a kid for some reason.
Been watching youtube clips for years and finally caught the stream live, Had to donste during sonic 06 cause its the most buggy mess, donation to runners choice.
How fast do you think Sonic goes? I'd say about 90
Can't watch at work, but it's always fun to listen in the background and sneak a peek while no one's looking. Gotta say, I wasn't expecting to see Ceaseless Discharge in a Sonic game. You're all doing great work for a great cause, keep it up!
Loving this Sonic games block, and especially excited to see Sonic '06 with Silver, the cutest clueless hedgie! Hope everyone is having a great time, and what are everyone's feeling about the upcoming Sonic movie? Personally, I'm hoping it sets up Robotnik's origin story, as well as explains why he needs to capture Sonic and not destroy him. I also hope it is the first in a series and we get Shadow and Silver movies.
Hello GDQ and hello Focus! I hope the run goes great today, best of lucks in the remainder of the run, have fun and you got this! Lots of hugs from your Spaniard boi! Donation goes towards runner's choice!
Good evening from Russia.Although, Sonic 06 is garbage (it is not), this is the best game that I want to see on any GDQ!Good luck with the run!
Only the coolest of names for the coolest of eight-themed ladies!!!!!!!! (There's 8 - count 'em!)
My wife and I have been watching with our toddler since yesterday. We're huge fans of the GDQ and even bigger fans of preventing cancer! We're looking forward to seeing the rest of the runs this week!Oh, and one more thing...HONK!
Vriska may have done some things wrong, but there is absolutely nothing wrong about giving to a worthy cause such as the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Wishing all the runners the very best of luck!!!!!!!!
Cancer researcher and Sonic superfan here! Had to donate a second time during the Sonic block because these games mean the world to me.. yes, even the hot garbage that is Sonic '06. Back in kindergarten a boy in my class used to draw me pictures of Sonic - fast forward to a couple decades later and he put a RING on it and we have two little hedgehoglettes of our own! Thanks for your help in fighting cancer and Dr. Robotnik himself! <3 Kitty

loving the fast blue hedgehog runs!
The Sonic block is always entertaining, thanks to all the runners and support staff for making this event possible.
Long time watcher, first time donator! Love watching GDQ and the runners crushing games we all grew up with. Here's to kicking cancers butt and here's to more great runs! rooDuck rooSpy
First time donating! Sonic 06 has an... interesting history with me. Too much for me to put in a comment for GDQ, but let's just say that I have a small place in my heart for it, and it'll be great to see a side to Sonic 06 I don't see broken as often. Donating now because I won't be able to be here to see Pokemon Sapphire tomorrow because of work. :(
Vriska did nothing wrong
Hey FocusSight, Lucky here! I'm extremely excited to see everyone's favorite flygon finally grace the AGDQ stage! I can't think of a better ally to brave the janky Silver physics with than the Prevent Cancer Foundation: cheers and good luck on your run! ;)
AAARIN. I am Superman. I believe I can fly.
Attending AGDQ in my hometown of Orlando this year. I flew back from Vancouver, Canada to attend with my best friend Dylan. Thanks Focussight for showing off the broken mess that is Sonic 06 and I'm looking forward to seeing my favorite Fallout games broken down to bits
Give Blaze a hug for me please. <3
Keep on rockin' everyone, you're doing a great job! And to my wonderful boyfriend Zach: Hey, nerd.
You're doing a great job! Love from Scotland!
Shoutout to my brother Serril in the crowd--he and I attended our first AGDQ last year and I wish I could have gone with him this year as well.
Thank you, good luck on the rest of the run Focus! Hope trial skip goes well
I always heard this game was Garbage and it may be, but the way FocusSight also speedruns his voice is making me change my mind.
Gotta go the speed limit!
York Uni says lets raise more than ever!
I'd like to personally thank DarkSpinesSonic for saving me from playing this game normally, which it wouldn't let me
Hi GDQ! Great to see Sonic 06 being ran again at GamesDoneQuick, great to see Focus running it on the big screen! Donation towards runner's choice - Greetings from Australia
It's no use.
Can someone tell me if the dash tricks are frame perfect or not?
Hello from the audience! First in-person GDQ and I'm loving it. Good vibes all round. Good luck to everybody running!
Kirbymastah with his last donation during the sonic block. I hope this donation will be of Some Use - let it go to Focus's choice. Also are we going to see THE BOX showcased today? Good luck Focus Sight and shoutouts to the entire sonic couch and crowd for keeping up the hype!
Big shoutout to the dance crew in the first row! The moves are just dope!Thank you, AGDQ for all the work you wonderful people have done in the past 10 years. Cheer to you! Or as we in Germany would say: "HONK!" ;D
Hello, darlings, it's Taako, you know, from TV? Sizzle It Up With Taako? I know you have my cookbook, because you love me, and I love you! But, uh, problem is, I'm not seeing a lot of love right now. I'm seeing this Zap Brannigan fool taking the spotlight, and uhhh if that's what you want, that regrettable hair representing the entire known universe, that's okay, I guess...but here's what I'm gonna do: I'm donating three gold for every time I was completely awesome today, and because I know *MY* fans are generous, good-looking, cancer-hating talents, and because I rolled an 18, I'm betting they'll match that awesomeness quota. Just leave a comment on how I inspired you to greatness, put aaaall those piggy banks on my name, and we'll kick cancer in the pants, what do you say? Friendly competition?
Donating one dollar for each time Focus says a trick is frame perfect. This donation is itself frame perfect!
I love Vriska and hate cancer! (i still love karkat tho dont worry)
This donation was frame perfect
Shout out to my favorite girl to watch GDQ with! Love you Anna!
Greetings from Germany
honk!
Hey Focus Buddy! I think my last donation fell into the depths, but I said I would donate again if you got Trial Skip! Though I said I would donate $50, but unlike you, I am not a Math Major.
Sonic 2006 is a celebration. Have a comfy and classy time!
I'll be back with more donations, but I have to try and win the work of art that is Gotta Go Quick for my oldest, Sonic-iest friend. (He doesn't know he wants it. He's wrong.) Thanks for a fantastic Sonic Block!
This run of sonic 06 is frame perfect, every frame.
So glad I made it home before the end of the Sonic block to make this donation. Gotta go fast!
Hey AGDQ, Cancer took my dad 6 years ago, I told my mom about what you guys have done and continue to do to help fight it. She wanted to say this to all of you:The oncologist said, “I wish we could eradicate Colitis”, which is what my husband had for 20 years before his cancer…not what I expected him to say. Many diseases have an increased chance of cancer associated with them. I applaud you for your innovative fundraising to prevent cancer before it starts! Keep gaming! Thank you.
Greetings from Denmark.
Only saw the last half, but that was great!
Fallout 1 and 2 are some of my favorite classic RPGS. Glad to see them and their spiritual successors run for a good cause.
hey all. donating this in honor of my dad who passed away in march due to pancreatic cancer. let's keep fighting for a future without cancer! shout-outs to everyone in the rolling start discord.
It's looking pretty safe, but my boyfriend desperately wants the Outer Worlds character name to be ZapBrannigan, so I'm doing my part to help him stay excited about watching his first AGDQ with me <3
thank you for doing every year the great events and lets fight cancer together.Danke, dass ihr immer wieder diesen tollen restream auf die Beine stellt. RUMMEL!!

Love AGDQ. I went last year but couldn't make it to this one. Had to continue my yearly donation. Also had to make sure to donate to one of my favorite game franchises! Good luck to the runner. P.S HYPE!
Cannot wait to be absolutely BAFFLED by how tomatoangus manages to complete all of Fallout in just over two hours. SO HYPE.
Good luck with the runs tomato! Fallout 3, NV and 4 are some my favourite games, and it's really fun seeing them broken in so many ways. I'm pretty new to watching speedrunning, but between summoningsalt and gamesdonequick it's been an enjoyable 12 months or so.First time donating, so thanks for raising money for a good cause!
My first donation, Watching AGDQ knowing my fiancé is out there watching too! I love you
Ayy Bobboh!
Running all the real fallout games heh ? Good luck to tomatoangus !
What's a waste-landers favourite rock group? Fall-out boy
can't wait to see the fallout and outer world runs. been watching gdq for a while now and i've been amazed every time glad to support a great cause.
Hello, its a great show as always. I watch AGDQ for three years now. Sadly I am working now so I am able to see less content but I have to follow the fallout run. Good luck and keep up this good project! :)
Huge Fallout fan and can't wait to see what can be done to these games!
My first time getting to watch live! You can do it Tomato!
Fallout is literally one of the first RPGs I tried my hardest to beat the fastest even before I knew there was such a thing as speedrunning. So excited to see it being ran at AGDQ! Donations.. donations never ends.
Amde here from the Chatmod-Team. Thanks for the great event once more and thanks to every other person that is helping onside and offside.
A Fallout Anthology run at AGDQ? That's the bomb! But hey, doesn't radiation CAUSE cancer? Here's some money to try to prevent it instead! Thanks for the amazing runs and supporting an awesome cause year after year!
I'm stoked to be able to watch Tommy destroy Anthology and cancer simultaneously! Cancer sucks and I'm glad to see so many people that agree
Howdy doodily honkerinos
Hey Tomato,Been enjoying your Fallout content on Youtube for quite some time. I really appreciate that you take the time to explain the skips you use during your runs, and its so impressive how you run all the main Fallout games back to back to back. You're one of the most entertaining runners and I'm so excited you got to be a part of AGDQ this year. Here's a little something from a fan, keep doing what you doing!Put this towards Tomato's choice.
First time donation here! As I sit at work and click away at Photoshop I'm absolutely enjoying these magnificent runs! All the best to every runner and <honk!>. CHEERS!
Give the Dancing Guy in the audience a medal!
Have to donate during one of my favorite franchises of all time. Fallout has gotten me through some rough times, and I'm thoroughly looking forward to seeing them all go by at the speed of light! Good luck to tomatoangus, and thanks to everyone making this fantastic event possible~!
Gotta go fast
Been watching AGDQ for awhile now, and this is the first year I've been financially stable enough to donate. Thank you to all the runners and staff who dedicate their time to this amazing cause.
Hi Everyone, excited to be here. My Daughter was just born a few hours ago, and i thought it was a perfect time to get my first ever Donation to a GDQ.In Honor to her Birthday I will Donate towards naming Rinoa in FFVIII, Lucia. Good Luck to all the Runners and God Bless my Friends!
Keep dancing on Kirby's music! AGDQ also cure sadness ! Love
Nothing a machete can't fix!
So honored to spend this week watching games smashed to pieces and supporting a good cause with my wife. Abby, I love you, and it is a joy to share each day with you.
Let's see if I can do this right... H... uh... Hunk? Well, Goose... I tried!
HONK for Outer Worlds President!
Is there anything better than coming home from a long day of work, cracking open an ice cold Nuka Cola, catching the Fallout speedrun, and donating to fight cancer? I don't think so. Thanks!
Best time of the year ! keep up the great work, love you all
Good luck runners! Here's to making Castlevania harder!
Take my bottlecaps, Edo! Unfortunatelly it's too late for me to watch the run. I blame Poochi. Good night!
My grandmothers brain cancer has relapce and she doesnt want to go through more rounds of kemo, she would much rather spend time with her family. Its crushing to watch what this dose to my family and I dont wish it upon anyone. Heres all I can donate this gdq sadly to help. Every penny helps work twoards a cancer free world.
Can't wait for the Fallout run, so here's my first donation of the week!
It's not much but it's honest money. Really love the Idea of combining videogames and a good cause. Keep it up!
Sonic Block was awesome AGDQ HYPE!
What's good GDQ? First time able to donate! I've been watching Fallout speedruns for ages, excited to see the entire series get deconstructed in a matter of minutes!Can I get a Honk from the Honksquad?

Greetings from Austria!Good luck to all the Runners :)
For my dad who just started Chemo today for his Prostate Cancer
I almost cried when I heard you guys are playing my favorite games of all time. I love you guys and think what you do is awesome
First time watching live and donating woot
Hey TomatoAngus! So happy to see you on the big stage. That's a real "G" move.
It's always a pleasure to hear from Edobean during GDQ! Donation to announcer's choice, and it'll be doubled if we hear Edobean do their favorite tongue twister!
This is a great time of the year and I always love seeing so many games destroyed in enjoyable new ways. And HONK!
This is the first GDQ I've ever donated at! Really loved all the runs in the Sonic block, thank you so much to all the runners for showing off their stuff on all those games! Putting this towards getting "Vriska" as Rinoa's name in Final Fantasy 8, which I'm really looking forward to!
Long time watcher, first time donating. Lost my dad last year to cancer and I hope this money helps no one else go through the same hardship I have.
The hedgehog pillow for donations brings me peace. I can outrun my nightmares while I sleep.
I wonder how many honks are in the fallout series.... At least this one, honk!
Tomato, show the memory den who's boss!
The sun has done so much for us all. It provides light and warmth and makes life possible. So shouldn't we show our appreciation with a nice hug? Put this toward saving the sun in the Outer Worlds - because suns are better than people! Good luck to tomato and sharo on their runs!
Long time watcher first time donator, my grandpa died of lung cancer a long while ago and I'm glad that the gaming community is so happy to band together to yeet cancer into the sun.
Hi Tomato, watching from Melbourne, Australia on my first speedrun live. Best of luck on your run.
Thanks for the good work you do!
Fallout is one of my favorite series. So excited to see all of these games in succession tonight!
Charity. Charity never changes... unless it involves video games!
My dad was diagnosed with cancer and had his lung and rub removed in 1997. He was told he wasn't able to live 6 months but he made it to 2013 when he finally passed away. It makes me happy to see such a great and amazing community coming together and fighting against something that took someone so dear to my life from me. Keep up the amazing work!!
Good luck Tommy, glad to see the name change fixed things.
Good luck, Tomato booty! I bet they never introduced mutant geese because it'd be to OP, honk!Lost my mom to cancer when I was 4 years old. Great cause and great event! Thank you GDQ!
Hyped for this Fallout Anthology run! Question for runner and couch: What's your favorite game in the series?
keep up all the great work.
Fallout is the genre that defined open world shenanigans for me! Love seeing them completed in record time, while it usually took me hundreds of hours (who is Shaun again?). Keep being awesome!Also: Fallout 3 & New Vegas remaster when Bethesda?
I doubt we'll see her in the run, but here's $5 for my girl Veronica, the best companion in all of Fallout. If anyone disagrees, well I guess they'll have to donate to prove me wrong ;)
Fallout HYPE!
Phineas is the best person to stop cancer so this goes towards saving him. Will donate an extra 5 if someone says any NCR trooper quote.
Thanks to all the runners and all the staff and volunteers for another amazing event.
Cancer sucks. Let's get rid of it once and for all. Y'dig?Love to the runners!
Playing games about radiation to fight cancer; seems apt. Love me some fallout.
Love us some tomatoes! Yours truly, Myla, Lola and Clark
Holy cow, I actually caught a GDQ?? The Overseer said this was starting NEXT week. Well, thank goodness we ran outta water and got to see it in time! You go Tomato! Donation to runner's choice!
Gary!
good job tomato!
So excited I get to catch the Fallout Anthology live!
I guess it was nothing.
Honk, Honk Puny Human!
if only someone had told benny that his life was going to be this way
Here's $11 in honor of my favorite Vault in the series. Keep crushing this run, Tomatoangus!
GDQ: So which Fallout game are you running?TomatoAngus: Yes.
Such a joy watching Tomato tear down my favorite Fallout games! Love the totally non-sarcastic storytelling by him as well :P
$25 in store credit for this incredible run
My kids and I look forward to watching GDQ every year. This year is a bit different because I'm watching in my wife's hospital room as she battles stage 4 bladder cancer. Thanks to all the runners for providing me with some stress relief!Here's to Preventing Cancer in the future, and finding cures for those fighting cancer.
Loving this Fowl-Out anthology run. Great to see you spread your wings in New Ve-Goose, my favorite of the series. Let's keep those donations going and nuke cancer! Honk!
Can't wait to see the Air Bud of speedrunning go through Memory Den!
Papa Paul Bless
When making Latte art in my coffee it didn't work, guess I forgot something.Well,I guess it was frothing.
This franchise means a lot to me - so naturally I'll be donating to celebrate its being utterly destroyed. Good luck!
Best fallout runs ever, thank you tomato
We all know Edobean can "Poyo!", but can Edobean "Honk!"? I'll donate another $25 to her choice of incentive if she does!
I've loved GDQ since I first started watching it years ago but have never been in a place to donate. That all changed this year when I finally got a great job and things couldn't be going better, so now it's my turn to join in the fun. Fallout has been one of my favorite series since I first played the first one over a decade ago so now seems like the perfect time to donate. Putting this toward the bonus game incentive, because more GDQ is best GDQ. Good luck to all the runners and let's make it so no one has to worry about cancer in the post nuclear wasteland.
Love to see such a great run and amazing commentary from my favorit speedrunner. Thank you GDQ and everyone involved for this amazing event! Big shout out to my pal Jesper for getting me into watching speedruns. Can we get a crowd HYPE!?
Hoping I get my frame perfect inputs during this amazing Fallout 4 run to get this donation through!
Long time watcher first time donating. Fallout was my first love when I got into PC games. Been an absolute pleasure watching what took me so long to beat absolutely destroyed. I guess in the end it was nothing.
I just have to donate for this awesome runner!
Loving Tomato explaining how to break Fallout. Keep up the great work everyone!
Silent 'G'? It must have been nothing.
Hey Tomato! I first found your channel through your... Interesting Mama Murphy speedrun and I've been a fan ever since. Good luck on your run! Incentive goes to runner's choice.
Good luck to my favorite nephew with love from North Carolina
I guess it was nothing.
I was going to donate $25 but the solo cup explanation deserved double.
The only Fallout that helps prevent cancer! What an achievement.Thank you for the amazing solo cup explanation!
Had to donate for the use of stunning visual aid.
Tomatos and muffin? interesting combination! good luck on the run tomato; and Mr. Covert Muffin, if you really are covert, does that mean you 100 in sneak?
Watching tomato angus almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter
PREVENT ALL OF THE CANCERS!!!
That explanation was complicated. So you're telling me Chocolatine is made of pipe cleaners?
Donating for the most complicated and impressive out of bounds glitch I’ve seen in a while!
here's to tomato for that helluva explanation and then pulling it off!
I really like tomato's visual aid.
All Fallout games matter, except for 76.
Thanks for that excellent explanation of COC planes
Excellent run so far, and it's always great to see New Vegas. In the spirit of the old west, I'll donate another 25 if Covertmuffin gives us some finger guns.
Homestuck
TomatoAngus sounds like Doc Brown in Back to the Future explaining time travel with models.
I love every single one of you. Can we get a round of applause for this amazing commentary?
This commentary is the best; go, Tomatoangus!
Shout out to the Space Jam. Great run and RIP Chet.
Lost my dad to cancer back in high school so I gotta donate to the cause. Also tomatoangus’ glitch props are amazing! Wait what was that? I guess it was nothing... :)
I started watching Tomato's runs after watching his youtube commentary for a slightly different category of the fallout anthology, so thought I'd donate now.
New Vegas was so buggy it crashed the GDQ website. Have my 25 caps for this amazing run.
::::)
Excellent visual aid helped me learn!
Really enjoying these Fallout runs, especially the commentary!
Epic Fallout run! Two hours and VAT’s all, folks!
I've never played any Fallout game in my life but Tomatoangus has me thoroughly entertained. Thanks for the lovely run!
Angus is the guy who does the entire group project and gets us all an A by proxy. Arts and crafts skills over 9000!
Hey, can Tomatoangus help my friend Claire. She tried quicksaving and quickloading in real life and she's caught in a wall. Thanks for any help!
Donating to yeet into the sun! I found out last week that I'll unfortunately be losing my job soon, so AGDQ has been my beacon of light. I love you all (and especially my boyfriend, Zach)!
Wow TomatoAngus, that is the best explanation of any speedrun tech in the history of GDQ. Props! Rap God talking. 10/10 speedrun
Shout out to my bro and bestie Ian, who’s always been my favorite person to play Fallout with until we cry-laugh. And shout out to Tomatoangus, my very favorite speed runner. GDQ HYPE!!
The fallout anthology runner is also the fallout anthology couch, love it! Dear couch: love you too!
I loved the explanation for the elevator skip in Fallout 4. Now I'm interested in learning it myself. Great speedrun! Keep up the awesome work!
Love fallout, this run is absolutely amazing!
Gary?
Watching Tomato's Fallout run. Super fun explanations of the speed tech ... with props! So, here's props to you.
Amazing runs across all these great games with fantastic commentary and insightful couch. The only thing that would have made this better is if tomato wore the Pip Boy from the Fallout 3 Collectors Edition. HONK!
HONK!!!!
Excited to be watching GDQ live instead of rewatching on YouTube, and glad to be able to donate to the cause. Just finished Outer Worlds last night, so I can't help but influence the ending. My donation isn't the best choice, it's Spacers Choice!
Quickload
4 Insane Fallout runs for the price of one! Loving GDQ so far. Donation goes to FF8 Blindfolded Menuing. You'll see why ;)
I've spent considerably more time on the Fallout games than 2 hours. This run is a delight!
Absolutely loving the event so far. Shout outs to TomatoAngus for making his Fallout runs the most entertaining runs I've ever seen! Keep it up everyone!
You'll see why.
Nothing in GDQ history has brought me more joy than Tomato bringing out a physical model to explain a trick. here's $40 for that 40 seconds saved!
thank you for your contribution to this great cause , keep on the good work
Big ups to Silent G for the best run slash set of runs I've ever seen
Wee Woo
You think this is terribly broken? Have you TRIED the VR version?
This is for Brad, whom cancer prevented from watching a run of one of his favorite games, Fallout 2. Actually this whole run is unbelievable, a 3-D diagram of clipping?! Who does that? TomatoAngus does. So here's my donation... Can I get store credit?
Loving all of these crazy Fallout glitches.
Greeting from Safespace!
Can't get any more fascinating than Tomato's Fallout 4 run and explanations. Looking forward to more from GDQ.
Finally got my girlfriend watching AGDQ. She isn't much of a gamer but loves watching the people dance at the events. I'll donate ANOTHER 75$ if we can get a dance party going. Donation runners choice.
Hyped Honk
I guess it was nothing, Honk!
Good job on the run so far Tomato. My sincere apologies for taking part in the overstratting this game. I regret nothing.
Loving this Fallout speedrun!!
This is a second twenty five bucks today because Mr.Angus is basically killing this set of fallout runs. the intrigue, the drama, the dioramas!
Hey Tom, big fan. Love you and your commentary, big thanks to you and GDQ for making this night one to look forward to!
Doubling down for CovertMuffin doubling down on pants on the couch.This Fallout 4 run is great!
I’ve been watching GDQs since 2013 and am always blown away, but this anthology run has been incredible. Great job Angus and the couch. Donation goes to runners choice.
GDQ is amazing
Did you Science the Door?
This is the greatest run I have ever seen! Keep up the good work! HYPE
Looking forward to The Outer Worlds. Here's $50 to naming the player after the most dashing and heroic space captain in the galaxy. Good luck to all the runners!
Guess it was nothing...Love these events, keep it up guys.Weh
I've been watching GDQ events since 2015 and have managed to make it to two of them. Bummed I couldn't make it this year, but I've been loving watching it so far! Let's beat these games and lets beat cancer!
Awesome event. Always awesome to see gamers unite to help those in need.
This Fallout run is the best GDQ run ever
This is way better than Golden Globes.
I don't think I have ever seen such a lively glitch exhibition before. Tomato, you are awesome.Greetings from a German with totally messed up sleep schedule
Talk Russian To Me
Love to all the staff, runners, and volunteers, especially my fellow mods <3
Had to donate for the Taylor Swift pipboy and the pants stacks! Bet you cant break the game a little more!
Fallout is my brothers favorite game. He loves to do mods for Fallout 3. I was never as big into it but I decided to watch this and it has been so enjoyable. You are so easy to listen to and your explanations are so great. Amazing run so far Tomato!
This Fallout run is amazing. Props to mister anGus and the couch.
i guess it was nothing
TomatoAngus is amazing, what a legendary run! Fallout 4 has never been so fun! Shout out to the 502 Krew! ORB
donation page back!
So, did you just stumble upon those pants?all this imagery is making the run look easy
Everybody knows that you should make Rinoa’s name Vriska. It only makes sense.
Been watching for a long time first time giving. You all have given me hours of enjoyment. Keep up the great work. Good luck runners. Honk
I have lost several family members to cancer, and I have always used video game as part of my grieving process. It is awesome to see people coming together to do something I love for such a great cause.
This Fallout run is *incredible*
Been watching for five years since I discovered you all while recovering from getting my wisdom teeth out, I haven’t missed an event ONCE . You all do such wonderful work and im so glad I can finally contribute financially. Lets get a round of applause for all the volunteers and runners! They're putting in so much hard work for this great cause! THANK YOU SO MUCH! HONK!!!!!!!!!! :O)
Long time watcher & first donating. Thank you all for everything that you do to make this event possible.
Shout outs to Covert Muffin for wearing all of those pants!
The visual aids for the elevator alone deserve a donation, much less forcing Covert to be dummy thicc.
Great commentary, great speedrun and great pants!
More pants!
Hi there first viewer and donator I really enjoy watching speed runs and I am happy i found GDQ Good luck on the run
Covertmuffin is just like everyone else he puts on his seven pairs of pants one leg at a time
Hey AGDQ! I am donating $5 for each extra pair of pants the couch puts on! Thank you for bringing funds to a much needed cause!
How many pants must a man put on, before he has too many pants?
undefined
Really enjoying the Fallout Anthology runs and this runner is very entertaining. Keep up the great work.
I think I missed 3 pants while I donated for the last pair... time to pay up!
covert's muffin is gonna be really toasty after 30 more minutes in 7 pairs of sweat pants....
Wow, this Fallout Anthology run is one of the most informative runs I've ever seen! Hats off to TomatoAngus and Pants On to CovertMuffin!
Currently watching AGDQ from Vermont and celebrating for our friend's bachelor party. Congratulations to Anderson and may all the runners be blessed with positive RNG vibes!
I demand all runs include props from now on.
TOMATO, REPEAT AFTER ME: HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK 🦆
Good luck to the runners!
Extra pants means more rad resistance, right? Only one way to find out. Great run!
Shout out to Tomato and his couch for what is easily one of the best runs I’ve seen in a long time. I’m going to put on a few more pairs of pants, now.
Jimmy is my brother and an awesome guy, so his excellent music should be chosen for the SIGIL playthrough. Your ears will thank you! Oldschool MIDI for life!
Never heard of TomatoAngus before but watching this Fallout run has me rolling. His props and pants one me over, so this donation is dedicated to you bud.
Tomatoangus, I love your detailed explanations and the way you keep looking into the camera. It makes your run really engaging! Thanks! Also, honk.
Cancer took my best friend this year, so here's a dollar for every year of her life. In memory of Stephanie Marie Besterci 💘
Tomatoangus might be doing one of the funniest speed runs I've ever watched. He's like the Carrot Top of the speedrunning community (that's a compliment right?). Thank you for changing your name for us and thank you to all the people working behind the scenes that are helping make all of this possible.
#doomtwid Give me those sweet Jimmy MIDIs!
This run of all the Fallout games is amazing!
Gotta go fast
I was doing dishes at the start of the Fallout Anthology run... and you people made it to Fallout 3 before I finished! I can't speedrun chores that fast!
Got to donate during Tomato's fallout anthology run. Love the props.
Shoutout to Spike Vegeta on tomato's pipboy!
Regarding the Fallout 4 portion of Fallout Anthology... WHAT
I've loved the Fallout series since the original. Shout out to my partner, Chris! Thanks for introducing me to GDQ! I love you with all my heart!
One of the best runs I’ve seen. The runner is so charismatic and informative. Keep up the good work, and I’m excited to see what else is in store for the week!
Hey chat -- donations are working again! Let's show Tomato some love for these fantastic Fallout runs.
Donating because Tomato is one of the most entertainer runners I've had the pleasure of watching.
Tracker down? I guess that was nothing.
This fallout anthology run is amazing!
Donation to runner's choice
Love me some AGDQ! Thanks to all the staff and runners for another great year!
Loving this Fallout run! I had to do a small donation just because TomatoAngus is so awesome. I'm a sucker for visual aids... Save the frames, kill the radroaches!
My brother introduced me to GDQ about 6 years ago and it has been amazing seeing this event grow every year. I love you all and GO FAST!
This is amazing! Thank you for the great explanations Tomatoangus!

Thanks Tomato for a great Fallout run and commentary
Hey Tomato, could you explain that last part again?
Thanks for all the hard work, both the staff and runners <3
A good friend of mine lost her mother to cancer last summer. She's a big Fallout fan and I wanted to make a donation during one of her favorite game series, even though I know she'd disapprove of skipping so much plot.
The Fallout Anthology run is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. Taylor Swift is behind everything!
Tomato is an incredible commentator and talented speedrunner, I had so much fun watching your run. Thank you!!
AGDQ time again! This is my fourth year following this amazing event and it blows me away every time. Big thanks to all the people behind the scenes keeping the stream up for all of us online. GDQ Hype!

Thanks for the amazing run and all the wonderful work you do every year!
DOOT!

Love GDQ I always watch it!!! DOOM BLOCK IS AWESOME!
Gotta see my Girl get to 3rd Climax!
Hey AGDQ! So stoked I could catch this live. I lost both my grandpa and a dear friend to cancer in 2014 and 2015, respectively. It's not much, but here's something to help out the cause!
Awesome inspiration work
*Heavy metal starts*
Frick cancer in the bum! Tell your mom tell your dad we were super rad!
I'm dedicating this donation to my sister, who recently lost her dog to cancer. He was such an adorable people person who was a precious member of our family. Remember, cancer affects all life, not just humans. Love your furry friends with all your heart. Good luck to all the runners! P.S.... HONK!
Just finished Doom 1 and 2 for the first time a few days ago, and they are absolutely among the best games I've ever played in terms of moment to moment gameplay, so its really cool to see a Doom block to sate my newfound Doom hunger. Good luck to all the runners, and thanks to GDQ and everyone behind it for all you do.
3rd climax go go go!

This for the dancers in the front row. Way to keep the set up times as entertaining as the runs!
the droid is readyhey hey
:)
[in serious tone] In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, One stood. He chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred, he found no peace. And with boiling blood, he scoured the umbral plains, seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. And those that suffered his wrath only heard his cry..."HONK!"
Speedruns are temporary. Doom is eternal
Greeting from Germany at 5 am. I lost three close family members to cancer, and a third one is fighting it right now. Anything to help eradicate this awful disease is a worthwhile cause in my book.
Doomguy for Smash 2019
Donating in memory of John 'Totalbiscuit' Bain. Taken from all of us far too soon by this horrible disease. Not a week goes by that I don't miss hearing his take on something in the industry. RIP John. We miss you.
Wanted to give a shout of to WillyG who just moved from the Intensive Care Unit to long term treatment. He’s a fighter and we all know if anyone can solve it, he can. So looking forward to this Doom run. It’s one of the first games I owned and got me started in tech all those years ago.
This donation is for the Legendary Dancing dudes in the crowd, you go Captain Dad and Blue Dad!
Hey AGDQ, long time watcher, first time donator. Haven't heard a lot of our lord and savior ORB, but we're still early in the week. Save the frames, and no, YOU'RE BREATHTAKING
It's 4am, I just finished an essay due tomorrow, can't wait to see a great run of Doom 2016!
Tear and Rip, Save the cacodemons!!!

RIP and TEAR until it's done! Best of luck to Byteme, cant wait to see them destroy the game!
I donated one dollar for every time the Amid Evil team said a bad word, then threw in a few extra. Frick cancer in the bum.
Doomblock so far has been one of the best blocks I've watched in a while. Glad to see Amid Evil get some love, and can't wait to see some demons gibbed quick in Doom16. Rip and tear, until it is done.
God bless every one of you who helps these runs happen, and God bless every one of you who donates and sacrifices for others this event!
Doom Cancer!

Super excited for this Doom run, and it's for a good cause! Win,win!
I've been watching SGDQ and AGDQ for 4 years now. I'm grateful for what you guys are doing! I've lost my grandpa 2 years ago to a rare skin cancer and I'm grateful for everyone that donates even if it's a little! From me and my family. Thank you to everyone donating and everyone organising this event!
I have recently beat Doom (2016) myself, so I'm really looking forward to this Speedrun crushing everything.Rip and Tear!
Rip and Tear both hell and cancer marines! Greetings from 5 am Europe.
After a long hard day at work, it's so great to come home to AGDQ with Covert on the mic! Everything GDQ community does feels my heart with joy, Thank you, All of you, so much! ... HONK :)
Great event (as always!) and those Amid Evil devs were a hoot.
Love the event so far. Been looking forward to the doom block all day. DOOOOOOOOOM!
Speedrun good
Sitting under a heated blanket in Japan with my partner, dying to see some Doom! Keep dancing front row!

Frick Cancer in the Bum
BYTE! Best of luck to you on this run! Rip and Tear until it is done!!
I appreciate everything you guys do for charity. Glad I was able to donate during DOOM. Good luck to the runner!
In the first age, in the first battle...The doomslayer clipped through the wall and went straight to the end
looks like it its time to rip and tear cancer apart
DOOOOOOOOM
ByteMe, the Science G! Byte! Byte! Come on over...
I had to donate to GDQ for a great cause and to make JoeDamillio's Super Castlevania 4 run tomorrow that much more challenging. Good luck to the runners and excellent job to the GDQ crew!
It took me 2 hours to get past the first level on Nightmare! Good luck!
Had to donate during doom, one of my favorite games of the last decade. Seeing byteme crush nightmare mode will feel so good after the HOURS of pain I spent completing it. Good luck to all the runners!
DOOOOOOOOOOOD!!
Die cancer. You don't belong in this world.
Announcer please give us your best shot at imitating the Doom BFG Division soundtrack! Thank you and lets kick some cancer demons in the face!
Rip and tear.
Doom hype!!!
I think there's a typo for the game title, I'm pretty sure it's actually called "DOOT"
Hey guys!! First time donating and catching doom live!!!! Good luckDOOOM!!!
No Byteme, you ARE the demons
Have to donate during DOOM! Easily one of the best shooters released in modern history, and one of my favorite runs for any GDQ!
Hey AGDQ. When I was a kid, my grandmother bought me my first gaming console, a Sega Genesis, which led me onto a path to working on video games myself, the first of which professionally was DOOM 2016 itself. At the end of last year, I sadly lost her to cancer. Without her, I would not have be where I am or who I am, and for that I am forever grateful. Tonight, I donate in her memory to one day help people to never go through what she did, and to help others never have to experience the pain my family did in losing her. Thank you Nana for everything you have done for me. I love you and miss you.
Doom block is best block! My fiancé and I have watched every GDQ together since the summer we met, and it’s a really special event for us, so thanks to all the runners and staff making it possible. Rip and tear!!
I always like DOOM as a kid, but my parent's wouldn't let me play it. I got to play spyro instead (which was phat), but I would always sneak onto the PC to hammer out a few hours killing demons. Cheers to GDQ, Cheers to doom, and Cheers to spyro
Rip and tear until it is done..
Hello! First time donating with more on the way this week! Donating to everyone who is fighting or has fought cancer! Thinking of you uncle
Good morning from the UK! Work is going to suck today after being up since 2am, but it's worth it to watch Byte (and the couch!) run DOOM live for charity. Say hi to Olivia and Sammy for me, and let's rip and tear cancer until it is done.
♥
DOOM 2016 is one of my favorite games of all time, and I cant wait to see how Byteme rips and tears it up!
Do you know your GDQ run history? I'm going to pretend I don't because I'm glad we're Doomed to repeat it! :D
I'm really excited for the upcoming DOOM run. It's going to be a HELL of a time, and I'm sure ByteMe is going to SLAY the game; I'm CACO-ing just thinking about it. We're all ETERNALly grateful for everything this marathon represents. With these $5 and everyone else's donations, I'm sure cancer will MEET!!!IT'S!!!!!!!...... shoot, I can't think of a good pun here. Audience, can you help me out here?
This donation is 100% for seeing BT on the couch during Doom :)
I put on 7 pairs of pants in order to get home in time to watch Doom from the comfort of my 100% nightmare couch. Save the frames, rip and tear the demons.
Byte, have a great run! Love your streams and remember: Vega in the streets, Baron in the sheets
Kill every last one of them! ...Wait, wrong game. Still, pretty sound advice.
Had to donate during one of my favorite games of all time, DOOM 2016, being run by a real master of the game. 100% Nightmare is no joke, and in under 3 hours is just insane! Good luck on the run ByteMe, Rip and Tear!
My aunt and grandpa died of cancer, and my mom was diagnosed last year. Thank you so much for everything you do. Let's put an end to all the loss and keep families strong!
Hey there, long time watcher, third time donating, love what you guys do, and just had to donate during the game that I'm in. Good luck on the run and remember, rip and tear until it is done.
One of my earliest gaming memories is playing the shareware version of DooM on my grandfather's old MS DOS PC. Unfortunately he was taken by lung cancer in 2000. Here's to you, Sarge! Lock and load, Slayers! Rip and tear cancer until it is done!
DOOM at AGDQ? Ecstatic to see the Doom community represented by some of the best. Let's RIP the definition of cancer right out of the dictionary AND TEAR it to shreds.#DoomCanByteMe
Looking forward to this speedrun of the best FPS of this past decade, rip and tear!!
DOOOOOM!
DOOM is one of my boyfriend’s favourite game to speed run! We are so excited to watch it this year. Thanks for harnessing the power of speed running for a great cause!
Really excited to see the Doom 2016 100% run - good luck ByteMe, rip and tear!
I have been playing all the Doom games since 1994. I still have a DOS computer setup just to play the classics!
Just finished Doom last week. LOVED IT! **SING METAL NOISES** DSH DSH DEERRR DSH DSH DEER **CHAINSAWW SOUNDDD**
Doomguy is 💓
My this donation be doomed to punch out Mike Tyson
My spouse and I have been wrapping up our nights watching some of our favorite games get snapped over the knees of these amazing runners for an incredible cause. Big thank you to the runners, announcers and coordinators who put so much work into making this event happen.Let's kick cancer in its sorry butt and break some more awesome games. AGDQ HOYPE!!
Shoot the things until they die.
Here's 2016 big boys for DOOM 2016. Let's glory kill cancer!
DOOM's the GOTY for 2016, thanks for making this run!
Rip and tear
We've watched GDQ for years and are excited to finally donate! Thank you so much to all the runners, hosts, organizers, and GDQ staff for making the world a better place. Frick cancer in the bum!
Honk and Tear
Love me some Doom. This one goes out to MAH MAN, Tom. Rawadiss 9 for life.
From the Future A'Deary's
Doom 2016 was such a surprisingly fun game for me that got me back into shooters and I love seeing it run in GDQ. Here is $25 to fight Omega Weapon in Final Fantasy 8.I'll donate 25 more dollars to Coverts choice if he sings the Doom song from Invader Zim.<Here are the lyrics>doom de doom doom doom do de doooooooom dooom do doom deee doooooom do dom dooom doom
Byte HYPE!It's been a joy being your moderator Byte!
Byte told me he was anti-smoking but how can that be with a smoking hot set of Doom runners on camera? Shoutouts to my Doom boys, congrats Dime on a great Sigil run, and good luck Byte on the 2016 run!
Great runs from some great people! Those Doom vinyls look demonically tasty.
Please turn up the music, everyone in the chat is begging for it.
DOOM block? Time to donate!
Chainsaw Bromance Hype!
Hey crowd, you know argent cells are orbs, right? Just sayin'.
This Doom run is amazing! Keep on slaying those demons.
(Please read this during the Final Fantasy VIII speedrun because Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite Final Fantasy and the only one I liked playing and with the remastered version on PS4, I might go back and earn the platinum for it!)While I spent over $159 for my favorite MMO, I know that many can't play games like I do because of cancer, so I am giving this donation because you are so wonderful and give up your free time, your money and your sanity for charity. One day, I plan to find a way to stream for charity and get a chair that helps me sit comfortably while streaming for long marathons. You are the true heroes!I wanted to donate for prizes but I probably would win any and getting a prize for donating sounds a bit crass, so instead, I want to put an incentive. Since the only Pokemon incentives are too obvious, I decided to donate for Suhalia Silver in Blazing Chrome to start off the bid war. Good luck!
Watching the Doom block every GDQ be like,"I'm going to sing the Doom song now!doomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomTHE END!"
Because "squall's fursona" has too many characters...
Shoutout to my buddy Beef who cant watch right now.
So glad to see Byteme running Doom 2016, the most frenetic run i have ever seen, it is just so satisfyimg. good luck Byteme and yes, nightmare difficulty, but apparently that is from the demons perspective :P
Greetings GDQ and Doom community. It's wild to think Doom has oldest speedrunning community out there. So many new tricks and strats that have developed over the last decade, keeping this game fresh and always evolving forward. It's a completely different world than it was back during my own involvement back between 2002 and 2005. Thanks to everyone for keeping one of the most iconic games alive 26 years later. I'll let KingDime pick where this money goes.
This Doom run is simply entrancing to watch.
Had to donate during Doom! My husband used to speed run this game back when it first came out, it's fun to see how much the run has changed since then!
Rip and Tear, until it is done!
First time donating. I love Doom 2016. Samuel Hayden did nothing wrong!
Doom is Hardcore. Video games are Hardcore. Everyone donating and working behind the scenes is Hardcore!!
For Jason Lewis Barlow
I love these events when they come around, and I love that one of my all time favorite games, DOOM, made it in!!! RIP AND TEAR!!!!!
Sick Gordon! Rip and tear baby!
It's always a good time listening and watching you all, have to thank the boyfriend (Chris), who is watching this right now as well! Keep being amazing and doing what you all do.
I'm loving DOOM! RIP AND TEAR UNTIL ALL CANCER IS DEAD! Good luck to ByteMe, keep dominating this run.
Oh we have *got* to see this 2p1c blindfolded Mike Tyson's Punch Out. Good luck to the other runners too, thanks for the great show so far and for helping a great cause!
Tag team punch out!!
Hi everybody! Resident Neurologist here. I've been catching the events since medical school and want to shout out to everyone who puts in their time, energy, and heart into making these events so fun and memorable. Bye everybody!
I have a very important question: What is the cutest demon in Doom?
Bien le bonjour de Belgique. Vous êtes super #DVVol2
Greetings, AGDQ. This goes to our dad, who lost his battle to cancer on December 24th, I love Doom and hopefully one day we'll get Doomguy to kick cancer's ass.

DOOOOM! aka, one man's quest to out angry hell.
Grew up playing Doom with my dad, he would step in to beat harder levels for me . Who knew the wholesomeness that could attach it self to the act of purging the planet of hellspawn. Thanks GDQ for what you do!
: : : : )
Hey GDQ, I do love this time of year and what better way to stop cancer then fighting it all the way too heck, as the one and only doom guy! Thank you to everyone who is here to help this year. Don't stop being awesome
Bro that invulnerability dive was insane! Shout out to DOOM!!!!!!!!
Man I’ll never get used to the 9000 FPS of DOOM 2016. Great run so far!
Doom (2016) is my favorite fps and I love watching Byteme destroy it in his run. good luck and RIP AND TEAR
Just say hi Luke, Steven, Ryan and Rashid
One simply never have enough DOOM.HONK.
Had to donate after that clutch secret grab as the countdown ended in the Doom run! Great work so far, and I'm definitely going to be tired at work tomorrow staying up for this, but it's worth it for the DOOOOOOM! Put this donation toward's runner's choice.
This run is incredible! March 20th can’t come soon enough so we can Rip and Tear in.....Animal Crossing New Horizons!
HONK AND TEAR, UNTIL IT IS DONE! Donation to runner's choice
Love seeing DOOOOM at GDQ keep up the amazing speedruns.
I had to leave a donation during Doom 2016 if only to share this fun story: I was visiting Italy a few years ago and was wearing a Doom hoodie on the streets of Rome. Some guy walked by me and cheered "DOOOOM!!" as he walked by me in the exact way that the lovely audience members have been doing this evening. Thanks for the awesome run and let's Rip and Tear cancer!
Played this game when it first came out while I was deployed to Afghanistan, very happy to see it Ripped and Torn up at breakneck speed. Super Shotgun OP, but please never nerf!
Always good to see 100% of my favourite series being done. Keep it up!
Hey guys, been watching AGDQ since 2012 and been a blast to watch all the racers. Keep it going.
Is this Halo??
Hey GDQ!Long time watcher, first time donor.I really enjoyed your Star Wars run Muffin, and the poem at the end was so heartwarming. I always enjoy your runs and love this amazing laughs :D Thanks to all the runners for making this event possible!Save the frames!
[e1m1 intensifies]
DOOOOOOOOOOOOM
Big Doom fan here. Good luck on this cool run.
Honk, rip, and tear. Let's go byte
I loved the any percent runs of Doom, but it's nice to see the game from the inside of the levels for a change.
DOOM has always been my go to shooter game! Been playing since 94, as a six year old. Let's clear Hell out and bring DOOM to Hell!!
Love the run and love this event! Special thanks to my lady for letting me hog the tv! TAKE A BATH DEMONS
Hey Doom Guy, if you happen to find my corpse, be sure to say h-and he’s gone already. Oh well.
Hello to ByteMe and Couch, and a special AYYO to Bryonato. Let's RIP AND TEAR cancer out of the future, one donation at a time. Good speed and RNG for the rest of the week!
Hey doooooooooom :) this is my first donation. My mother got cancer last Christmas so let’s doooooom it. Greetings from Germany ;)
Keep kicking some butt!!!!
"Cancer is stupid. It's about to be stupid and dead."~ DoomGuy, probably
I've always wanted to be able to donate live to this event. This year I actually have been able to watch it live. I was going to wait to for the Mario Block to donate, but this run is absolutely amazing. So much so that I feel the need to donate during both, so here is $100 to DOOOOOOOM cancer!
Been watching GDQ for years and am finally able to attend live. It's great to watch people who know this modern classic inside and out rip and tear it to pieces.
I thought this game was too fast when I plodded my way through it, turns out it requires a super human to take it to the limit that it deserves. I can barely follow what's going on. As it should be. Speaking of super human, 2 players blindfolded on 1 controller in Punch Out? I can't.. even... I just need to go to bed now.
It's like watching ByteMe do ballet, bloody, bloody ballet. With guts. And gore. Ya know, I'd go to the ballet if it were more like DOOOOOOOM!
The run is fantastic and highly entertaining. Happy to donate to research determined to send cancer cells to their DOOM in hell. Have a good night everyone!
Can't help but donate for DOOM
Hey GDQ! I've been watching for a few years and finally decided to donate to some of my favorite games this year. Here's to a great rest of the week.
Hello! This is my first donation! Yall are incredible, this run is Awesome. This event is legendary. Long live GDQ. (Hey announcer, you're doing great!)
Love seeing the Doomslayer at GDQ. Keep it up and rip and tear until cancer is done!
I hear these demons are only angry because some goose wandered in to hell, knocked their hats off and ate their sandwiches!
Dooooooooooom!
Shout out to my wife playing Pokemon on the couch while demons are dying en masse on the big screen. Gotta slay 'em all.
My best friend and roommate beat cancer this year. Donation goes to bloodthunder's choice if he names his top 3 metal albums of 2019
Point and click your Guts!
From the loudest Quake clan in the land... Woo woo woo, YOU KNOW IT! See you at QuakeCon 2020 and keep killing those demons :)
Let's point and click cancer like Byteme point and clicked those demons
Loving the runner and couch commentary for this fantastic DOOM 2016 run. The best FPS in years. This goes to runner's choice!P.S: Hype for Bayonetta coming up!!
CANCER IS HUGE! THAT MEANS IT HAS HUGE GUTS!POINT AND CLICK!POINT AND CLICK YOUR GUTS!
"here I go, killin' again"
Oh how it breaks the evening's gloom,To see Byteme through levels zoom,To see him rip,To see him tear,And conquer the challenge of DOOM.
Hope this is the single donation that pushes us over the edge to beating cancer
My wife introduced me to AGDQ and watching it with her is now is my favorite week every year! She helped me find all the Doom collectibles so this run is extra fun to watch! HONK AND TEAR!
Killer commentary in this Doom run, keep it up guys.
This was one of my favorites games of this decade and I love to see it getting absolutely torn apart for such a great cause, DOOOOOOOOOM!
Not including Between the Buried and Me or Rivers of Nihil in your 2019 best metal albums. Amateur.
Clearly, Doom 2016 is not only a FPS and Point & Click Adventure...it's clearly a Dating Sim as well! So which weapon are you going to romance? >=)Donation goes to runner's choice.
POINT AND CLICK EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM!
Bonus $10 if the announcer pronounces my name correctly.Also, Doom 2016 has IMPressive graphics for a point-and-click!
How do you like your steaks, because I like mine tri TIP AND RARE
Be grateful he didn't install Mac OS instead
Another night of point and click adventures? I didnt know Myst made a 4th game.Donation to man in the wonderful orange shirt.
$50 for the excellent office-chair commentary. I'm glad you finally found excellent lumbar support.

(In Demon Voice)On the second day, of the marathon run, when the sun was down, one sat. He chose the path of %100 completion. In his relentless haste, he missed no collectibles, and with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plains seeking to destroy cancer. And those who tasted the bite of his sword named him..... ByteMe.Point and Click until it is done.

Death surrounds me, yet, in my head I hear something that sounds like angels! Lo! I have found the holy grail of firepower! Mine eyes can but weep as they bear witness to the majesty... the BFG 9000!As I stride knee deep through the dead, all is clear. I know what must be done. My cause is just... my will is strong... and my gun is very, very large!

I thought the point-n-click block was LAST night. But alright, I guess this is basically Myst with guns... right?
The next time someone wants to watch something romantic i will load up a vod of this run and show them the greatest love story of our time.
I have never enjoyed Doom, but this run and especially these people has changed my mind. Keep up the good work!

Absolutely loving this run so had to donate. Great runner, great couch and great commendation by Covert. Point and click , DOOOOOOOOOOM
The video ByteMe was referring to is most likely the one from the Boundary Break series by Shesez. "Out of Bounds Discoveries | DOOM (2016) - Boundary Break"
Greetings from germany. My grandmum survived cancer but my granddad lost the fight. Thank you Byte to rip and tear until cancer is done.
"This is Cobert" the announcer crackered. "You must fight the demons!"So ByteMe gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall."HE GOING TO KILL US" said the demons"I will shoot at him" said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. ByteMe plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill."No! I must kill the demons" he shoutedThe announcer said "No, ByteMe. You are the demons"And then ByteMe was a zombie.
Hey there! ID Software QA Here just wanting to thank you for playing DOOM 2016! I Can't wait to watch all the runs in DOOM: Eternal in the future! Oh and I can't forget. RIP AND TEAR! UNTIL IT IS DONE! DOOOOOOOOOM! See you all in March!

Love these Doom speed runs... just didn't know that this game has this much content. <3
I played DOOM last year while recovering from surgery. Laying there high on painkillers trying not to move while everything hurt, Doom really got me through. I played on baby mode, so watching you blaze through on nightmare is mindblowing. Rip and tear, and RIP to cancer!
Sending 9 dollars because I just ordered fast food on mobile, send help.

#DOOMCanByteMe“LETS RIP AND TEAR THROUGH CANCER AND SEND IT BACK TO HELL!!Much respect to Byteme and KingDime and all the runners. GDQ beautiful event and making a difference. Let us all keep changing lives.
All this talk about “rip and tear” is making me really hungry for Monkey Bread. Oh wait - that’s “tear and share.” Ah well. DOOOOOOM!!
This Doom run is so much fun I don't want it to end, but I guess that's not really the point of a speedrun. CLICK AND TEAR
How's your Bane? "Ah you think doom is your ally? You merely adopted the doom. I was born in it, molded by it."
EAST COAST DON'T SLEEP! RIP AND CHEW!

Great event for a great cause; keep up the good work, everyone!
Slam into a RIP AND TEAR! OOOOHHHH YEEEAAAA!
Who knew point and clicks could be so intense?
This run is point and click adventure to a donation. Keep it up! Quick question, what kind of rig are you running to maintain 200 FPS?
I have no idea what's going on, but the commentary on this speed run is by far the most entertaining one I've watched to date.
MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD
(Please read in DOOM guy voice)HONK!

Excuse my small amount but never been happier during these gas station night shifts, glad all the great people in this world are up this late special thanks to everyone apart of this stream for the amazing entertainment. Including you crowd can I get a nice and loud DOOM to bless our ears??

*Sing like the movie*"Yoooooou, Doom-ing that thing you Doooommm"Shout out to the guy in red on the coach for asking all the questions he somehow knew I had while watching. Great way of helping people (like me) learn who have no idea about this game.
RIP AND TEAR!!!! My Roommate and I love watching ADQ everytime it is on!! Thank you for the amazing gameplay and support for Cancer Prevention!
It's the best to start the day with so much fun. :-) Greetings from germany! You're great!

This run is gonna have me up all night watching, so I guess I better get a coffee and SIP AND STAREEEEE
(in joker voice) "People run Sonic all day and no one bats an eye, but you start to rip and tear and everyone loses their minds!"
Rip and Click this Point and Tear
I'd like to thank everyone who helps make Games Done Quick happen, but never shows up on camera. As one who knows, it involves a lot of hard work to make everything seem so easy.Byteme: keep fighting all the Clowns of Heck to fight cancer.
Doot your way through heck! Rip and tear cancer!
Another $25 for the Bane, with one more request:*regular voice* That's a big gun*Bane voice* For you.
Hello from Bird School! These runners clearly graduated from our ripping and tearing classes, and we're excited to contribute our first community donation of many this event, going towards the Super Monkey Ball Master run! Shoutout to all the tech, social media, and other behind the scenes crew, you guys rock.
Can we get Chrsitmas song from the crowd. Runners Choice for being fabulously entertaining
This run is making me grip my chair. When we can make it work, we’re making a trip out there.Sitting in the room would take an IV drip for care.Take a sip on a dare. To split food, rip and share.I’ll get in trouble if I keep going at this point (and click.)Poor, but told I need to stop with the puns on our couch.
Rip and tear the cancer, also, trans rights!
I knew I liked Doom, but this run and commentary have been taking things to another level! Keep up the great work, and RIP AND TEEEEARRR!!

#DOOMcanbyteme BYTE Fantastic run, always a pleasure to watch, RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE
I'm finally able to donate for my first AGDQ! Looking forward to all the runs, and Rip and Tear, until it is done!
Staying up late to finish this run. Amazing commentary and fricking cancer is what I live for. I know its GDQ's tenth anniversary, but for me, it's the tenth anniversary of my late boyfriend's cancer diagnosis. Without an amazing community in gaming, I dont know where I would be today.. so thank you guys for fighting the good fight. And can we get a "MARTHA!!" ?
Dashing through those demons like snow.Like a one man machine to slay.Over the corpses we go.Laughing all the way.Rip and Tear.
This Doom run has been the most wholesomely violent speedrun I've had the honor of watching. RIP AND TEAR cancer, fine sirs!
The energy in this run is infectious! Shout out to the crowd for being awesome, the couch for being informative, the runner for absolutely flying through this game and having a blast doing it, and Muffin for being Muffin. RIP AND TEAR!!!
ByteMe, have you been cheating on me with The Gauss Cannon? Siege Mode gets you around faster, but I am as Iconic as the Icon of Sin! We'll have words later in Samuel Hayden's office, when you get done with the RIP AND TEAR
Getting hungry while slaying demons? EAT A PEARRRRRRR
Hey Kap, Worsel from the Bayonetta Speedrun Discord here! Wish I could have been there but good luck with the run and I hope Rodin "stomps the yard" on every attack. Shout-outs to the first runners of this game back on the Wii U who got things started and to everyone watching: if you can't donate be sure to tell others about this event, help spread the word. And remember, Bayo 2 is the best Star Fox game.
What a wonderful Demon-stration of your speed-running skills!
Oh my god I should have been in bed hours ago, but this run is way too good. I'm going to be DOOMED at work tomorrow. Worth it.
Love the speed runs! Keep it up, yet still waiting for point and click adventure part three! Let’s get it done Byteme! Rip and tear!

Much love from the entire Pikmin community. We're right 'behind you' every step of the way. Play good "Kap"tain.
First time donor, long time watcher here! Bayonetta is one of my all time favorite franchises, so what better time to donate? My grandma was diagnosed with cancer around a year ago, and has unfortunately been in a slow decline. I hope no one ever has to go through what she has, so hopefully even this little bit of money will help out.Also, it was Jeanne- the Bayonetta character's- birthday yesterday! Happy birthday, Jeanne! :)

And here I thought there wasn't going to be any Star Fox at agdq
Kap, you're doing great! Couch, we love you! Audio crew, you da best!
Just got home, time to enjoy some games I've heard of but never played, completed too fast to understand what's going on. Hype for AGDQ!
Here's the extra 25 I promised... plus an extra 50 cents for the excellent answer
Great work on the run Kap :) Can we get a couch intro & commentary???
Congrats to Kat and Elia on their engagement today! Hope you enjoy the rest of your GDQ. Best of luck to all the runners this week, shout outs to y'all.
This doesn't look like Star Fox...Good luck on your run Kap! :)
I can finally say it! Long time viewer, first time donator, though this definitely won't be the only time this week for this wonderful cause. Bayonetta 2 is one of my favorite games, and even while playing fast, you're keepin' it stylish! Dunk those angels, Kap!

You are asleep right now, so Snorlax Bun, Officer Judy Bun, and Emily Bun are having a picnic with me in a lovely Moon Park! We are having chamomile tea, pink lemonade, carrot soup, and strawberry-lemon cake for dessert. You are the best big sister in the world, and Del Bun loves you very very VERY much!

Is that Jimmy Kimmel on the couch?Brodie ~ Australia
Just saying "Hi" to my beautiful wife, Tracie. Maybe the comment will be read on the stream. That'd be cool. I'd watch the re-stream and surprise her. She's asleep now. The end.
Save them frames.
It's for charity?! I'm in!
Nice dance moves from that guy in the crowd, also you two guys casting and commenting are 🔥🔥🔥
Is it just me, or does the commentator sound a lot like a certain hero of the MCU? I'll donate another $10 if he gives us his best "I... am Iron Man."
Carl Carl, Dude Dude, Man Man!!!Had to donate while my favorite GTA streamer is on the couch. I'm glad you finally get to show off SA at a GDQ

Fun Fact: James Cameron also partly wrote Terminator 1 and 2. If Michael Bay had any involvement in them we probably wouldn't be talking about them in 2020. Love the run and commentary. P.s. Grand Theft HONK
KZ cuties are watching, and some of them are probably more stressed than the runner. GL with the run Reset and GL with the commentary.

Is this the line for the Not Australian Not Named Lauren train?
Being sick with the flu for the last few days ain't so bad with GDQ in stream.
I was finally able to take vacation for the entire event and plan to for each one from now on. Maybe I'll have the courage to go to the event eventually but for now I'm happy to just watch.
Greetings from Edinburgh, Scotland, home of Rockstar North. Great to see San Andreas at AGDQ, arguably the best Grand Theft Auto. Nothing beats cruising the countryside while blasting out K-Rose. Honk!
Long time watcher, first time donator!I'm finally in a position to donate after many years watching. Kudos to everyone involved in getting this event together twice a year.I've also had a lot of hassle getting San Andreas running on a modern PC so I can empathise.Stay classy everyone!
There is ups and downs to everything technical difficulties are bad but getting breakfast without missing something of the run is great
I always love watching these old gta runs, the commentary is super fun and the gameplay is incredibly impressive. Greetings from the UK and sorry about the technical issues.
Keep up the good work GDQ. Let's do our best to beat Cancer!
greeting from england love the work you all do, keep it up!this is my first donation and won't be my last
Finally getting a chance to donate to GDQ, Glad GTASA is back up and running. Dono goes to announcers choice. Also, Honk!
Love this event. Much Love from Sweden
for excellent cometary from player and couch very entertaining
When you spend more time with farm animals than with your wife, you'll get a lonely heart. And a nasty infection.K-Rose has a special place in my heart. Not entirely sure if it's for the right reasons, but shush.
I heard all I had to do was follow the train, so here I am! Thanks for the run.
I'm just here to give money to tired people playing video games to beat cancer
San Andreas country music Karaoke? I'm all for it! "All my ex-es come from Texas!"
Here's $25 for a K Rose sing-along from the couch! You could say that's never happened before

Stop honking! I'm trying to sleep. Greetings from Poland. HONK!
St Andreas country music karaoke? I'm all for it, cos all my ex-es come from Texas.

Un grand bravo aux speedrunners, à toute l'équipe américaine et française de se relayer nuits et jours.Etant atteinte d'une maladie génétique orpheline (Syndrome Ehlers-Danlos) et en fauteuil roulant, je ne peux qu'adhérer à ce genre d'initiative. Il y a des choses importantes dont on ne parle que trop peu et où quasi zéro moyens ne sont mis en place.Un magnifique évènement pour une magnifique cause.Love u all.#MarioLight

Aww snap here we go again
Hey GDQ ! So happy we got to this time of the year again !I enjoy a long lunch break to watch an hour and a half of this great run and make my first donation.I won't be able to watch as much live as I want this year because of my job, but at least I can top my usual donation amount !Good luck Reset, and good GDQ to everybody!
Did you know? All skeletons have epilepsy. This doesn't make sense, since they don't have eyes... Or brains. Nonetheless your warnings are appreciated. The skeletons will spare you for now. Incentive is Enigma's choice.
Greetings from Germany. First time donor. My dad managed to beat throat cancer a few years ago. Let's kick cancers butt. Good luck to all the runners and let's bingo a million before the weekend! Donation goes to the cats choice.
Took me like 3 months playing on and off to get through flight school the 1st time :/ New to GDQ but really enjoying the run so far
Great show, guys! Best of luck :)
Hey Reset, cineQ here, remember to use the gun in heli to destroy targets Kappa good luck with the rest of the run man
Shout out to my mom who recently got diagnosed with cancer, thank you to everyone fighting to end it
Just a reminder that we still appreciate you for warning us about the epilepsy triggers. Watching this run brings back so many memories. I don't think I have ever played a game that felt as big as San Andreas. Greetings from Denmark.
You're both wrong, Urban Yeti is the best Grand Theft Auto game!Joking though, love the run!
this plane section is giving me flashbacks to superman 64. i'm not sure if i should be grateful for that fact. enjoying the run so far though! also enjoying the velvety tones of coach's magnificent hosting!
Pleased to see Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas being played this year. One of my favorites to play casually. Good luck to the runner!
Get after cancer, boiiiiiis

Just chilling on holidays by watching two best GTA speedrunners and donating some to prevent cancer. HONK from Russia!
San Andreas besto game OH YEAAH!
HONK!
Thanks for running GTA San Andreas; this game is awesome! Totally worth waking up early for. Keep kicking cancer where it hurts.
Great run great cause!
Honestly this run is perfect to listen to and sometimes sneakily peek onto while at work. My colleague already wonders why I keep headbobbing randomly :) The music is great and watching takes me back to a great time during my adolescence. Shoutout to both the runner and the guy on the couch. You are doing an AMAZING job.
keep up the good work
I love AGDQ. There have been hundreds of donations saying, "What a great cause!", but it really is. Cancer is responsible for just under 50% of human deaths, but survival rates have suddenly increased over the past 50 years. That's down to a better understanding of cancer pathology, a better understanding that ultimately relies on money. Thank you to all the runners, organizers, and donaters.
The lawless movie you meant is "The Purge". I think.Honk from Germany
Thanks for noticing us, senpai!
Informational message for the lawless movie. It's called The Purge. Incentive to runners choice.
OMG he is playing for over 3h, time for a 20 min break.
Good marathon & good luck, from France.
Let's kick cancer's a... butt GDQ. Can I get a HYYYYYPE? Also, let's get that Blindfolded Punchout incentive!!
Hey couch guy, the movie you said is The Purge. First time donator!!! Thanks to Reset I will finally see the rest of the game I didn't finish in my childhood, what an amazing run, like a manly man. All I wanted to do was follow the donation train.
300k hype! Never played San Andreas but this run is amazing!
Giving my morning coffee money before I head out to work, love what you all are doing and let’s have a great day :)
ORB! Oh sorry, I meant to say HONK!
Here's ten dollars to remind yall that I'm coming up and am currently about 50k from being met. Let's see that upgrade to hard mode!
Let's go San Andreas!! #reset
