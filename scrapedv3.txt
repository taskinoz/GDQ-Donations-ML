A Hat in Time is one of my favorite games and Now Kid is worth every cent
Long time lurker, first time donor. Happy to finally be able to contribute. I can’t wait to slack off at work all week as I watch the stream instead of doing my job. I wont say more, because there’s a distinct possibility that my boss is also watching. Jonathan, stay away from my desk this week.

The isk train has no brakes.
My great uncle died of cancer and my mother-in-law had a false positive a few years ago, so I always try to donate what I can each year. Keep up the amazing work and happy 10 years!
Smiley face from the crowd! :D
$10 for every year of GDQ. What you do with this event represents some of the best of what gaming can be. Keep it up!Put my donation to a childhood favorite, Tetrisphere. Fun fact: the game is actually rendered on a donut instead of a sphere! Mmmm donuts.
You folks rock! Hi friends at home I'm watching with! Trans Rights
Hey GDQ! This is my first time donating, and I have a very important question for Enhu: "Where is my guest difficulty?"
Been watching for quite a while, thanks for all the great memories AGDQ!
This is the first GDQ I've watched live and just had to donate! Good luck to all the runners
It's time again for another GDQ! Looking forward to a great week of runs.
If everyone watching donated $5 right now, we would blow past 500k right off the hat! (get it...because hats...) anyway $5 train hype!
Just wanted to thank everyone; GDQ Staff, the Runners and PCF. These marathons are a major highlight for my year. This cause is personal to me, having had several members of my family both pass and survive cancer, I'm sure in no small part thanks to organizations like this one. I cant thank you all enough so I hope this little bit helps! Can I get an early game "HYYYYPE!!" ?
Really enjoying the A hat in Time race so far, it's great to see more love for AHIT. Shoutouts to NotNite.
Hi everyone, been watching AGDQ for 3 or 4 years now and figured it was time to contribute. Love what you guys do, keep up the good work raising money to fight cancer!
Boop!
I played this game for the first time this holiday break and absolutely fell in love with it. Can we get a shoutout to the composer who did an amazing job with the music for this game.
Hi gdq! Been watching since the very first gdq, down in that iconic basement, on that iconic couch. Happy that we have built such an awesome tradition! Have my money!
Hey everybody! It's that time of year again! Ready to enjoy some incredible speedruns while donating to a good cause, and I hope everyone else is ready to do the same! Put my donation towards the Sonic '06 speedrun incentive, because... Muahahahahahaha!
Hat in Time was already criminally adorable before the first DLC, and they somehow managed to make it cuter with it. D-Pad down to Smooch!
Hey all, Yetee Here. We're so excited to be here at AGDQ 2020! Here is $10,000 to celebrate 10 years of speedrunning excellence. Congratulations, Games Done Quick! Let's Gooooooooo!

[To be read during Mega Man 7]Praise-ed be to Bord, that most magnificent of misaligned animals! From his humble origins as mere glitched enemy in Battletoads & Double Dragon, Bord has grown into a memorable fellow with his great "wisdom" ("Great minds will eat you," anyone?) and including a swelling family including the cake-eating Fatbord, the exasperated Brod, and the possible(?) new arrival Flatbord. Let us hear the clarion call of our lovable friend: SQUEH!Thank you, PJ, for being a PJ. I hope Rush behaves today.
First day of gdq, hype! Good luck to all the runners!
Happy New Year and happy AGDQ, here's to an amazing week of speedruns! Let's kick cancer's butt!
Great race! Lots of fun tech and great movement, really close in the end too. Looking forward to my favorite 2D Metroid, Zero Mission.Putting it towards the first Bonus Game, Sonic 06!(If the site adds numbers to my name ignore them, it's simply TheMasterDS)

GDQ's been one of my events to look forward to over the last few years... wait... why are you killing the dargons (Ridley)? And going to kill the metal dargon (Meta Ridley)?! I thought we were saving the animals! D:Donating for Sonic '06 bonus run because who doesn't want to see someone further break an already broken hot mess of a game?
commenting is hard. I can't think of anything I am comfortable with anyone reading. so I hope you all at gdq have a great week.
My wife and I are attending GDQ for the first time in person after watching online for years and we are SO EXCITED! We're so excited to see games run fast for a great charity, live.
Wow, 10 years?! That's really awesome. Congratulations to everyone who have made these events possible all these years.

hi, long time watcher first-time donor, I wanted to make this donation in me and my friend's name Guy Neil the third. he is a huge fan of metroid. We both lost our mom, his to cancer and mine to an autoimmune disease. He helped me get through the loss and I want him to know that there are people that are there for him, and I am grateful that he was there for me. I hope this helps prevent others from losing their moms. And further research in helping those who are dealing with this disease.
Love me some Zero Mission! Keep up the good work y'all :3
What's up GDQ 2020? First GDQ donation of the year, and first GDQ donation of the decade! This shoutout goes out to Covert Muffin, because without his laugh it just isn't GDQ. I love it when you do the Star Wars. Take a bath.
Just had to donate at the first GDQ I can attend in person! Shout outs to Trish, Reese, and Archer!
Can’t wait to watch SMB3 with my girlfriend later
First time managed to watch AGDQ from the very beginning. Glad community managed to beat last time record of donations before first game.
This is the first GDQ event i'm watching live and it's also my first time donating. I'm really glad to have found a nonprofit speedrun event like GDQ and will continue to watch all events going forwards. Here's to another decade of great runs, strange run tech, and HYPE! This donation goes towards Mario and Luigi co-op final boss.
Yay AGDQ!
I hear all this talk about PB... but wheres the J?!Dragondarc's choice!
Zero Mission is one of my favorite Metroid games! Great job to JRP, and best of luck to all of the runners this week! Donation goes to the DKC Filename "krool," a name I used when I first got 100% on this game when I was younger.
My dad likes to call them burnt bags (overcooked chicken)
Roger isn’t the bro we need, but the one we deserve.#RogerTheBro
Is Samus a Magical Girl?
Hi GDQ! This year’s event resonates with me more than usual, partly because of how far you’ve come since your humble beginnings, but also because my father-in-law was diagnosed with prostate cancer just a few days ago. We’re waiting for results from additional exams, but in the meantime, here’s 30$ for hope, awareness, and thanks for all of the speedrunning community’s efforts throughout the years.
Hello Runners!! Gotta donate for 1 of my favorite games of all time coming up today The Binding of Isaac!! Love seeing this game back on stage!! Good luck to all the runners this week!!!
AGDQ is one of the two highlights of my year! I love seeing all the amazing talent on show!
Just imagine the Kraid fight from his perspective: you're a giant lizard and have this puny human pop up. You're ready to crush them but instead they shoot 3 missiles at you and you just die in about a secondThanks to for the great speedrun!
This is my first time being able to donate to GDQ and I'm glad I'm able to do it during the Zero Mission run, since the GBA metroids were my introduction to the series. Best of luck to all the runners this year!
Thanks for calling this to our attention, Daniel! This is very important work.
I can't do much but here's a little bit to do my part. Lost too many of my family to cancer and it shouldn't happen to anybody. lets band together and put that cancer in it's place.
So excited for another GDQ. Thank you to all of the volunteers for your hard work! Jealous of my pals Adamrious, Slick, and Edardris who are in attendance. Maybe next year!
Choo choo!
Had to put in my first donation during a PJ run because my name is also PJ. May the power of all PJs flow through you and carry you to a world record. looking forward to an awesome week of games, friends, and charity!
Awesome Zero Mission run for a great cause, game on guys!

Bon agdq à tous, merci aux commentateurs et bourré les dons :)
Good luck to all the runners.
Hey all! R recently my other nan has been diagnosed with several cancers and we know we don't have a lot of time left with her. It's not much but I hope this can help towards the cause, so someday no-one will have to go through this.
Gimme that metroid mug!
Salut ! Premier don de ma part. c'est parti pour ce superbe event ! Bourrez les dons ! #DVVol2

It's compelling to think that this has been going on for 10 years now. That's a significant chunk of my life.
Thank you PJ, PLC, and Games Done Quick for all the entertainment throughout the years. And just remember- Do the thing. Let this donation go to PJ's choice.
It's somehow a little bit ironic, that AGDQ starts on the exact same day my grandma dies due to late complications of her brain cancer. One more reason to donate for the fight against cancer!Keep on running, guys!
Here we go again! Have fun guys!

Been watching GDQ for as long as I can remember and have never donated. Here's 50 English pounds. Keep up the good work!
I have no idea what Myst is but I see this bid war has nothing on it so might as well put some money on it. Might as well see what happens when you save this Saavedro character. Is it like "Saving" or "Killing The Animals"? Let's find out.
Long time viewer, first time donater. Looking forward to another week of incredible runs. I especially can't wait for the Bad Games Block.
cheers
It's GDQ time and Obligatory Twitch Prime sub Reminder. I'll be watching all week and can't wait for the EDF run with our heckin good guy Halfcoordinated.

Hi guys, glad to be here for the first GDQ of the decade! I've been watching since 2014 and try to donate a bit every year. Put this toward the Sonic 06 run.
One of my favorite runners for years. I see he traded in the grapple arm for a buster. Good Luck on your run PJ!
2nd donation for a great opening line up for AGDQ2020!
This is the best time of year, cheers to usatei and eyegush.
Did I hear Sonic 06?
Someone needs a new mug and to help raise money for cancer research. I admire y'all even more now than before since a cancerous tumor was found and removed from my father's lungs a few years ago.Also, HI HALFCOORDINATED!
Had to donate during my favorite game of all time, Megaman 7!Thanks GDQ for keeping awesome and the runner for representing the 32bit Megaman community!

GDQ 2020 HYYYYPE! Go Mega Man!
My dad lost his fight with pancreatic cancer in March, so I am pumped to be able to donate to a cause that could help people with this. Growing up, gaming was our thing. I had to donate during Mega Man 7 in his honor since this was one of the games I remember watching him play when I was little. Thanks for supporting a great cause!
Been watching GDQ since 2013. Can't get enough of this awesome community supporting this awesome cause.
Had to donate while my favorite runner PJ was playing, donation to his choice.
My kids and I love GDQ. Thanks to all the staff, runners, and volunteers who make it possible. Let's go fast and raise money for charity.
WINKY IS A FROG
Greetings form Poland to all You guys! Great work everyone.
Here's to a good cause!
1st time being able to catch a GDQ live, and so happy to be able to give to such a good cause. I lost my uncle to lung cancer last year, and my other uncle is currently battling prostate cancer. Donation goes to runner's choice.
I've been watching GDQ's for years but this is the first one a I can share with my two month old daughter Aubrey. Doing my part to make sure that she may see an end to cancer in her lifetime.
I'm having to work overtime this weekend and y'all are keeping me company. keep up the hype!
Happy 10 year anniversary GDQ!!!Good luck to PJ on the run. Let's go good boy skip!
I am more than a robot! Die Wily!
Lost my mom to cancer last year and i want revenge, let's donate to kill cancer and get revenge on the lives it's taken. Also enjoying the guy in the audience in the blue shirt who was rocking out to the awesome music. happy 2020 everyone!!
Hey ColourCloseToCyan here, I try to donate each year during PJ's run, wishing all the runners the best with their runs this year. Go Team Poor Life Choices.
Hard to believe it's been 10 years, here's to PJ continuing to break games in very unique ways and team poor life choices
Greetings from the frosty north of Norway! Stoked to catch the beginning of the marathon, and exited to see the spectacular runs ahead of us. This donation goes to PJ’s choice - hopefully it goes to something terrible during the awful block.
My boyfriend is A HUGE megaman fan. He's on the couch behind the runners right now. Hi babe! Thanks for introducing me to this AWESOME event
PJ, here's hoping spontaneous combustion and falling through the floor are minimal during the run. Thanks for all you do for the speedrunning community and the charities supported!
hey pj, been subbed to you for almost 3 years and actually caught your stream less than 5 times so clearly I know the best way to spend my money. Here's some money to see if doctors without borders knows of some good ways to spend it too
Finally able to donate during a PJ run just to say "thanks"! I started watching speedruns after being linked to one of PJs Bionic Commando Rearmed runs and now I'm absolutely hooked. I'm just finishing up night shift in Australia - thanks to PJ for the amazing runs, and to GDQ for preserving my sanity in these last, few hours before I get to go sleep.
Always happy to tune in and watch these awesome speedruns every year, especially when its for a great cause. My mother and sister have both beaten breast cancer, and I have started early testing to keep an eye on my health. Thank you for all that you do and good luck to the runners!! Cheers!
Greetings from Germany. Good Luck on the MM7 run and lets all make this week awesome.
PJ, Don't forget to do the thing - Also good luck to you and all the runners.
Watching GDQs over the years got me interested in understanding how video games work and now I work in the games industry making games! What y'all do is awesome. Have a great GDQ!
Only been watching for a few years. Love the event. My first chance to donate. Spent yesterday catching up on the 10year anniversary CGDQ Mega Man Runs. Love being able to watch Mega Man 7 live with my boys.
I have always enjoyed GDQ and this year it hits a bit closer to home, so this year I'm donating in loving memory of my Uncle Mike who passed away from intestinal cancer late last year. To a new decade, hopefully, one with less cancer.
Hi PJ! Im hoping Rush doesnt troll you with searching this run.
Hoping for Metroid tumbler, thank you for such a wonderful zero mission run just now. Metroid means a lot to me and I’m happy that while everything is going crazy around me this community will still be so happy. Good luck all upcoming runners! *dab*
Hey, good luck on one of my favorite runs PJ! Heres a few bucks to a good cause!
Though I'll be at work for part of the run the world must see Sonic '06 in it's messy glory
Yes! One of the best 2 weeks of the year is back. Time to get hype!
Been watching since 2015 and can finally donate for the first time. Such a great event, keep going forever!
A FIGHTING ROBOT MEGA MAN
Good Luck PJ
Glad to be able to catch one of my favourite event of the year on the first day! Here's to an amazing week and good luck to every runner!
You've got this, PJ "most GDQ runs" DiCesare! Here, take this "AntiPanic B" battlechip.
Mega Man 7 is kind of weird, but it still ended up being one of my favorite MM games. Good luck fighting "Dr. Willy!"
HI AGDQ. My Grandmother and my uncle died by cancer. So here a somme $ to support the fight against cancer and prevent families from that i have experienced.
I'm not able to watch many streams, but everything I've seen of PJ leads me to think he's very genuine and earnest in what he does. I hope to see more of him going forward. Good luck on the rest of the run, and to all the runners to come.Per my personal GDQ tradition, I'm putting this donation towards naming the Zelda filename GirlLink, as much of a long shot it is to win.
Sorry Im late to the joint, but good luck, PJ! I'll donate 50 more if Rush becomes a good boy at the beginning of the final boss fight. Also looking forward to the Mega Man 4, 5, and 6 relay race! Mega luck! (Teleports out)
*To the best of your abilities, say to the beat of the Fresh Prince Theme*This is a story all about howVideogames got flipped turned upside downI'd like to take a minute just site right thereI'll tell you how speedruns became kings of the new yearIn a basement CGDQ was born and raisedOn a couch speedrunners started the crazeChilling out maxing, relaxing, making speedruns look smoothShooting down records as fast as they couldWhen a couple of guys they were up to do goodStarted raising money for the common goodI watched one little run and and saw how much everyone caredAnd said "I'm watching every year, this is HYPE I declared"

Putting this towards the Sonic '06 bonus run, because that sounds like exactly the kind of beautiful broken mess of a game I love seeing at GDQ.
Megaman 7 was my first game in the franchise and I glad to see it broken, give Turboman the beating he deserves PJ and can I get a $1 train going for all the other people who are watching GDQ in a VR headset right now? .... Am alone in that aren't I?
Yaasssssss! Starting the new year off RIGHT, with AGDQ, PJ, and Mega Man 7!!!! Thanks for 10 years for fantastic speed runs! Hats off to all the runners, the crew, and everyone helps support this great event.
Hi PJ, great run so far. Hope to see you someday run the Spencer Screaming Simulator again.
Thank you all so much. My son and I are excited to watch another AGDQ. Happy New Year. Let there be peace! Let this be the decade we defeat cancer! Much love to you all.

Putting my donation towards hearing Gehn sing. Riven was the game I obsessed over during my fresman year in college. Me and my friend Gilbert would meet after classes and spend hours at his computer going over every detail. Somewhere in a box in a closet somewhere I probably still have the notebook filled with our maps and clues where we worked out the mysteries of the D'ni number system. Hats off to the runner, and remember to check behind every door!
shoutouts to 2nd Plantman

Hello everyone, John Dip here from the hit movies, Piyerts of the Kardashians. I'm here with Yarnold Yortsin Yayger from the hit movies, Urgmignaters. We are upset to see no one having started the hash tag donation chain for $20.20. We are here to start that chain. Love watching GDQ as we are making our new films, keep them Donations coming - #$20.20.
Fulfilling a promise to LogicPuzzle for kindly gifting subs to over 150 people in the chat he deserves alot of praise for contributing to such a cause!
Hey AGDQ like the event like the runs go on go fast :D @germench finde super wie ihr euch reinhängt mach weiter so :D
Sonic 06 is just the right amount of terrible to be an amazing run.
Vidya Games being broken? Great prizes? A great cause? AND a week off?! Sounds too good to be true! But it is! Get 2020 off to a great start!
For all the Bwahaha's. We love you Covert!
Hooty Hoo!

My gramma passed away 4 years ago now from Throat cancer; I am honoured to donate in her memory! The work GDQ does for the Prevent Cancer foundation is incredible and inspiring.
You're awesome, Uncle PJ!
Favorite runner playing my favorite series? I think I'm legally obligated to donate at this point!
Great job with Mega Man 7! I love that AGDQ is kicking off with the likes of Metroid and Mega Man this year. That inspired me to donate early! Good luck to the runners.
I have such a busy week ahead of me I fear I might not have time to watch all the GDQ epicness. You all do such great work though, keep on keeping on!
Hey KillaLombax! Glad to see my favourite duo back at GDQ for the 10th anniversary, and for the first time on a PS3 episode!Shoutouts to all the Racpack as always, and keep on exploring the galaxy as you always do, one Ravager whip at a time. Love from France!

Hey, deuxième fois que je regarde l'AGDQ, la dernière fois, j'avais gagné le panier garni, encore merci :) Vous faites (toujours) du bon boulot et je regarde pas beaucoup de speedrun, mais à force de découvrir cet univers, c'est très intéressant, surtout quand c'est pour la bonne cause. #TempeteDivine
Definitely not my first time watching,Definitely won't be the last,But it is my first time donating 🧡
Merci LFR pour ces resreams chaque année, merci aux commentateurs. Bourrez les dons ;)#GDQup
Donating so that in the future no one has to experience breast cancer the way that my mom did.
Woot!
appreciate the passion of speedrun and collect for a good thing!
Watching for the first time and blown away by the excellent runs for a such a good cause
Thank you to all the runners and organizers!
Happy 10th anniversary, GDQ! We've been catching the events live since 2015 and love them every time! Big thanks to runners, staff, volunteers and PCF! Good luck and have fun this week!
Thanks for all you do GDQ
GDQ HYPE!
#DarkMage
Ratchet and Clank nostalgy is the best kind of nostalgy.
I sank hundreds of hours into Ratchet and Clank on the PS2, and I can't wait to see it crushed at AQDQ.Life's short, why not make games short too?
First time watching AGDQ live, and super excited to see this Tools of Destruction run, seeing as it was one of the games that got me into the Ratchet and Clank series, and despite its history of freezing and refusing to load on my PS3, I still love to go back to the game. Even though it technically isn't the right phrase for this game, let's annihilate Tachyon, the Cragmites, and cancer.
When I saw that today AGDQ was starting, I screamed of joy. Can’t wait to donate more during one of my favorite weeks of the year!
Started watching GDQ (and speedruns in general) this past fall, and this is my first time catching one live! I love how supportive this community is of the LGBT+ community and of course, how much money we can raise multiple times a year for a great cause!
Thanks for the great work!
Gotta donate for Ratchet & Clank Speedruns.
Good luck to Runners!
Mario Time? I guess that'll be later.
My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 renal cell cancer. While he's still fighting the good fight, putting in this donation to hope that less people in the future have to go through what I'm going through. Putting this towards the Riven Easter Egg, since my dad and I use to play Riven together when I was a kid.
Love to see Ratchet & Clank get some GQD love!
Greetings from Chile, it's my first time donating to the GDQ. I watch the stream since 2012 and my dream is to go one day as a spectator. GDQ is my favorite event and you fill my heart with happiness every time I see you. XOXOXO
I love you PJ!
I love GDQ and have been watching vods for ages. Excited to catch one live! Best of luck to all the runners
Good luck on the run Killalombax!
First time donating and what more fitting way than for the 10th year anniversary. The event has been great so far and we're all doing it for a great cause! Good luck to all the runners!
Best wishes from Germany
With over 1,000 hours into The Binding of Isaac, I am really excited to see StoneAgeMarcus destroy this game with ease!
Chic, je vais pouvoir (pour changer) rester couché une semaine en regardant plein de jeu, c'est la patte ! Signé : un toutou nommé Kubo. #DarkMage
I love Ratchet and Clank. Casual. No fancy stuff for me.Good Luck
Happy to donate and watch GDQ with friends as it's been a tradition for 2 years now. Good luck to the runners and super hopeful to see the Sonic '06 run!
I don't know what to say but here's money
My mother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer, and it's because of organizations like PCF and others dedicated to new treatment options and breakthroughs that she's going in for treatment instead of less positive outcomes. Thank you, GDQ, and thank you PCF. You've helped so many, and I want to help in turn!
Hello everyone ! i'm really proud to participate at the 10th birthday of the GDQ. Good luck for all speedrunners and see you later i promise ;) PS : sorry if my english is bad, kisses from France <3
The Myst games were some of the first I ever played. I can’t wait to see them on the big screen for an hour.
My dad went to his doctor with a pain in his leg mid-2018. After an entire year of endless visits, and medical tests to eliminate all possibilities, he was finally diagnosed with a rare case of Hodgkins lymphoma. He has ended his final bout of treatment, with his last scan in 2 weeks to confirm his chemo has eradicated all remnants of this terrible disease. His nurses in my local cancer ward have been so supportive though every step of the healing process, and I have nothing but the highest respect for any medical staff helping all others who are going through this too. I couldn't think of a better time to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation than during a run from one of my favourite franchises of all time, one of the few franchises in which I have perfected practically every installment. Dr. Nefarious is best villain. LAAAAAAWREEEEEENNNNNNCCCCCEEEE!!!!!!
Greetings from Finland! Thank you for doing this year after year.
hi! this is my second time watching gdq and i'm so stoked! shoutout to my boyfriend kyle for getting me into this awesome charity cause!
I just wanted to say...KAAAZOOOO! (This one is for you Collin)
The best part of a new year!
I had to donate during my favorite game series of all time. Thank you runners and GDQ staff. Oh, did you know, all of the regular and prime subs money goes towards the total donation amount? Get the twitch prime sub wave going! :)
Oh goodie... I got to make a donation, and here I thought it'd never go through whilst floating through space on this asteroid. Hope sir doesn't mind using him to amplify the signal to do this. Put this towards the Star Wars bonus rash level
Happy 10th anniversary GDQ ! Here's to ten more years and to another wonderful week of awesome speedruns !
Very happy to see a Myst block this year. Saving Saavedro showcases more of Brad Dourif's performance range in Myst III: Exile. As they say in D'ni: Shorah!
battons le cancer

Loved playing Ratchet & Clank games as a kid, especially the Future series. Happy to donate to a great cause. Good luck to the runners!

Donating early to call out my students, hopefully some of them will follow suit and donate. Thank you AGDQ staff and supporters for showing what can be accomplished with Video games.
First time donation and being here at GDQ Let's take cancer out back and beat it down.
Greeting AGDQ, and Happy New Year. What better way to start 2020 than with a full week of nice games speedily completed, and donations toward a good cause.
Still amazed to see what's possible within games like Ratchet & Clank watching those speedruns. I'm happy to support this great event and the Prevent Camcer Foundation.Greetings to everyone and good luck to the speedrunners.
First of multiple 10 dollar donations in honor of the 10 year anniversary. Shout out to the two kittens on my couch Arthur and Lucas.
I am not patient enough for Speed Runs. You are doing an awesome job! Keep going!!!
I love GDQ, and I'm so hype that it's GDQ time again! Thanks to everyone at work behind the scenes to make this happen. $3 million hype!
Watching from Middlesboro, Kentucky love you all show gamers can change the world
Been watching for years through times both good and bad. About to start up schooling again after some detours in life, and you happened to set the event to the week before I'll start being busy with that. Thanks!
Lets a go!
LAWRENCE !!! CRUSH THIS LOMBAX !!!
I LOVE THIS STREAM!
Congratulations from Germany on raising money for the good cause.
So you mean to tell me, that I can help charity, win awesome prizes AND see more of CovertMuffin by simply donating? That's a great idea! Let's do that, shall we? Good luck to Covert and all the other runners, may RNG be with you.
Gotta do a little anime cancel.
(to the tune of the SpongeBob Squarepants theme song)Who lives in a TIE Fighter near Yavin 3Covert Muffin,Friendly and funny and well bathed is heCovert Muffin,If speeder crashes be something you wishCovert Muffin,I hope that Rosh's head is removed with a swish,Covert Muffin,Covert Muffin,Covert Muffin,Covert Muffin.(donation towards bonus Rosh level)
Did you ever hear the awesomeness of Covert Muffin The Wise? I thought not. It's not a story the Sith would tell you. It's a Jedi legend. Covert Muffin was a Grand Fwahaha-er of the Jedi, so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to PB runs live…
zelda is the boy
No comment
5 for the blue tshirt guy in the front row ^^ keep them moves up
A friendly reminder to all who are donating to check if their employer does charity gift matching. Mine does and will be doubling all my donations over the course of the week!
Had to catch some Star Wars action from GDQ! This is the way. From San Antonio, with love!
If everyone donated 5 bucks right now... I can't do math but that would be a lot of money!
Thank you AGDQ for helping to make the world a better place. Blessings to all those effected by cancer.
glad to support such a great cause and stay hydrated bois!
I just thought Puwexil should know that Twitch chat has dubbed him "Dance Dad" - Keep it up!
#REDSABOROP Muffin Muffin! What are you doing?! This mod did something unthinkable... It took some NPCs and raised them to new heights! Especially Howlers, LITERALLY, I mean they're flying now. When lightning strikes, don't worry if you can't see. But do know that neither can Muffin. If you thought Kylo Rens lightsaber was cool, you havn't seen this mod yet! From saber maces to fingernails, I hope they prove a worthy challenger. Though not as worthy as the bikes who shall haunt you FOREVER muhahaha. Good Luck :)
Greetings from Israel, lovely people! Keep up encouraging others. Ratchet and Clank was awesome!
First time donating but have been watching for years. Much love to the runners, staff, and community for a truly wonderful cause.
Shout outs to covertmuffin, the only Star Wars character that's cuter than Baby Yoda. May the Force be with you, and may the Baths be Taken!

You're already saving the animals, so you might as well save Saavedro while you're at it.
My dad and I love watching GDQ.
Good luck on the run! May the RNG be with you!
My dad just finished his last round of chemo. Here's to helping prevent that for others.
My best friend and I make a tradition of watching GDQ. Always a great time for a good cause. Good luck to all the runners!
5$ per person watching? Sounds like a donation train to me. Choooooo chooooo!

Après avoir perdus deux amis proches cette années à cause de cette saleté ça me paraissait le bon momentMerci à toute l'équipe du French Restream, �� l'AGDQ et à tous les gens qui créent autant de bonne humeur autour de ce combat. Adrien, Sandra, Jacques, je pense fort à vous, où que vous soyez, votre lumière nous manque... Je vous aime.De l'amour, du positif pour tous. Faisons sa fête au cancer ! Bourrez les dons !
Good Luck To All the Runners! Lets do it big!!
CovertMuffin is an absolute treasure of a person! Keep on being that ray of sunshine, bro! Let's get that Incentive! Donating to a good cause while we do it can't hurt either :D
I always look forward to Muffin's runs at GDQ. Good luck and may the force be with you!
I love this game. Ravensoftware is one of my favorite companies, and I hate how Activision is forcing them to work only on COD. Have you ever heard of Singularity? It's one of my favorite games by Raven. It's an awesome Sci-Fi FPS game. I would love to see you play it to give it more exposure.
Bonus levels? I love bonus levels!
I love you GDQ! <3
Muffin you are a wonderful runner with an infectious wholesomeness, let's get that incentive done.
Good luck CovertMuffin! Always enjoy watching your runs and commentary!
First time ever donating to GDQ. No one should have to suffer the horrors of cancer so everyone should give whatever they can and stop cancer in its tracks. I'm constantly amazed at the level of skill put on display at these events, Good luck to all the speed runners.
Good luck on the run Mr. Muffin! Your enthusiasm is infectious and a pleasure to see. Here's to 2020 and a lot more reasons to FWAHAHAHA! All the best to the community, Doctors without Borders, and all you viewers at home. HYPE!
That couch looks a bit empty still, let's fill it up!Good luck on your run Covertmuffin!
*Wilhelm Scream*
now this is podracing
Shout out to my friend Andres who is literally dabbing right now to your incredible performance on that speeder bike.
Thank you all once again for another year of AGDQ. My friends lost their son to leukemia and so I try to donate every year in his memory. This is for Connor and so no other parents need to endure such a situation. Runners choice for incentives.
Hey, velociraptors and underwater sandworms aside - this mod still makes more sense than Rise of Skywalker, wouldn't you say?
Never even heard of this game before! Donating simply because Covert Muffin is such an enthusiastic runner! Also, I like to think that these insane glitches are simply due to expert use of the Force
Coucou, merci leFrenchRestream pour votre restream de L'AGDQ depuis toutes ces années ! Continuez comme ça, Courage pour cette semaine à tous les ambianceurs et commentateurs !#Goupix
#REDSABOROPGreetings from fwahaha! I'm loving this run, and Muffin's energy is so emblematic of what makes GDQ such a great event.Perhaps we should put a bit of this donation towards buying him a second couch... at this rate he's gonna need it. Or maybe a replacement speeder bike?Save the frames, pet the animals, take a bath, and kill the Jedi Council!P.S. twitch chat, it's time for cute fwahahas.
Always a blast watching a run by Covertmuffin. Good luck and may the force be with you!
Yay covert muffin!!!
Hello GDQ team and awesome people in the crowd, glad to catch the event from the first day. Thanks alot to the GDQ team for the amazing work over the years. So, to get back into the mood, can i get a HYYYYYYYYYYYYPE PS. Love to all of you and greetings from Germany <3
Here's to my grandma and grandpa, both of whom succumbed to cancer last year. We lost them both suddenly and without almost any warning, just six month apart from each other. I don't have much, but here's hoping that someday we can kick cancers butt for good. Lots of love from Finland, and good luck on the run!!
covertmuffin's laugh literally clears my skin. also super cool that you guys added pronouns!!!
Here's the 100 I promised for the deaths in my run plus an extra 100 for the softlocks i got in practice
Can't mistake that laugh
hi guys! be fast be good and kill the animal
This is the way!
I can't believe I missed the first 6 hours of GDQ! Glad I got in on the first day to start making my usual daily donations! Nothing better than supporting charity and good will in video games at the same time!
It's always a joy watching covertmuffin with his laugh as iconic as Chewbacca's growl. So, in order to make him laugh, here's a joke. Why did episode 4, 5, and 6 come out before 1, 2, and 3? (Read in best Yoda voice to unlock another $10) Because in charge of directing, Yoda was.
The true Force Power is Quake 3 momentum physics.
If everybody is watching donates 5 bucks it would really be a nice 700,000. Wouldn't it be awesome to break the first million by tomorrow?But as I know that not all people can donate, I can cover 3 of them as well!
Thanks for all the hard work!
I've never seen this game before and yet I am super entertained. Thanks for the awesome run and commentary!
love the runner <3
Seeing AGDQ again is brightening my stressful house hunting week. It's always fantastic to see Covertmuffin so here's some money for his cheerful laugh.
This Jedi Academy run is Lit!
first time donating to gdq. love this event, love riven. i hope that we can get that opera incentive in time, but it looks like the ending has not yet been written.
Fwahaha! May the force be with you : )
We can unlock the couch, but sadly the Recliner is DLC and the Sectional was a preorder bonus. Happy ten years of GDQ!
Always amazing to see (and hear!) uns by covertmuffin! Good luck with the run!
The Dark Side of the Speedrun is a pathway to many frame skips some consider to be... Unnatural.
Happy 10th anniversary, GDQ! Had to donate when I saw an unmet Myst incentive.
I feel like donating covertmuffin himself to the prevent cancer foundation for extensive research on the effect his laugh is having on cancer could prove extremely useful since I haven't heard a laugh as cancer-curing as his ever before. Looking forward to his runs every time!Greetings from Berlin, Germany.
Nice
Rosh? Take my money!
Locking your commentary couch behind paid DLC? That's just cruel man! You're an awesome dude and keep up the fun bike launches :)
Let's get this started! Can I get a HYPE?!?
Glad to throw down for a good cause! Put this towards announcer's choice.
Always love GDQ. Great cause. keep it up :)
Never donated before but I've watched CovertMuffin vods too many times not to when I finally get to watch him live at GDQ.
First donation this year, been watching and donating for... 7 years now ? Oh boy ! As always, thanks every single one of you people for your dedication to this awesome event supporting a cause that is very important to me.Happy anniversary GDQ, here is to 10 more years of speedrunning generosity !

I look forward to GDQ as soon as the last one ends. I can't donate every time, but when I can, I don't even think about it. Other people need it more than I do.
Thank you for AGDQ, always entertaining, forever helpful!
Cause this little jedi muffin is pretty funny
I've never watched Muffin before this event, and I absolutely love the energy and passion he has for this run! I'm going to reinstall this game and mod to try it myself. Much love for all the runners a hosts. Never forget... the ORB.. Have a great day everyone!

O sole mio~!
Much love to all.
This is in the memories of my late chosen grandpas, Lon, Gary, and Len, who each died of cancer. I miss them so much.Save Saavedro!
I had to donate for Muffins run, his runs always cheers me up.
Maybe the doors should make themselves useful. Having a great time watching Muffin’s run (as always)!
My favorite runner running one of my favorite games. May the Fwahaha be with you, always. P.S. HEY WATCH IT!

Good times, and have fun!!
Yoda Voice: Eyrrrrrrr
Hey AGDQ,I've been tuning in to this event for the last few years, and I really admire what you guys do. I lost a brother to cancer last year, so I'm donating to the cause in the hopes we someday find a cure for this terrible disease. Save the animals?

I'm playing The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ right now while watching the GDQ. I need to donate during The Binding of Isaac run. Keep up the good work and happy 10th anniversary GDQ!
Glad to see my passion for video games has come this far helping raise money for amazing foundations. Keep up the great work, I watch every year and will continue to support these amazing causes.
I always enjoy watching Covert Muffin do a speed run, and especially appreciate his positivity, laughter, and vulnerability. Let's do this, AGDQ!
I had to donate after that touching poem from CovertMuffin. BibleThump
Another GDQ, another donation! Let's prevent cancer through the power of video games!
We love you covertmuffin.
Mario race hype!

#CoeurNoir	Vive isaac, enfin au GDQ!
I always love AGDQ, I wish we could do this stuff weekly though I know if we did we would suffer from event fatigue so we just need to donate while we have the chance.
Here’s to another year of gamers coming together to do good and I had to donate after an amazing run by Covertmuffin and can’t wait to see the amazing Gymnast later tonight
I never gave permission for my likeness to be used in Chameleon Twist, please remove me from the bid war.
Best of luck to all the runners!!
Thank you all for everything you do. This event is always a great reminder that gaming can be a power for good and bring everyone together.
Thanks everyone for the hard work you have and will put in over the next week. You absolute legends.
Thank you, volunteers that sort through donation messages <3

Can't wait for the SMB 3 race!
Un petit don pour un geste qui me semble malgré tout important. Parce que cette saloperie continue de nous enlever nos proches, il est nécessaire de prendre conscience que nous pouvons tous, à notre échelle, agir dans le bon sens (contre le Cancer mais bien d'autres choses aussi).Merci de continuer de donner de la vie et un sens à ces évènements, courage à tout le staff. Bises (mettez la somme sur l'incentive que vous voulez, là où c'est nécessaire)#MarioLight
I have been both addicted to and afflicted by The Binding of Isaac for a few years now, so no better time to donate, right? Thanks to all the runners and the GDQ team for these inspiring and fun events. I'll be watching all week; best of luck!
<3
Cette fois-ci je ne me tromperai pas ! Des bisous et un Bretzel pour chaque commentateur ! #DarkMage
Hello, I’m dark (man) dad 😊It is literally AWESOME what you all are doing❤️My very best to AGDQ for your continued success Mohan Vodoor
I am someone who works with cancer patients and wanted to say thanks to GDQ and all the runners for organising such a great event and raising so much money.
Thank you GDQ team, keep doing what you do. Binding of Isaac hypeee
Fresh outta college and looking to make a difference in the fight against cancer when I make it to med school. Better start this journey off right by donating to my favorite yearly event.PS: Skate 4 when?
A big fan of Binding of Isaac. May all your rolls be high in damage and speed. All the best.
Hey all. Been a while since I've had a chance to donate, things have been pretty crazy in my life lately. Wish I could be there in-person with all of you, but alas. Best of luck to all the runners of AGDQ 2020 and here's hoping we break some more records this year. Putting this towards the co-op final boss in Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga.
Had to donate to emphasize that heartfelt donation from CovertMuffin. To all those out there you are seen, heard, and loved. 2020 will be our year!
Good Luck for your run Marcus though Zamiel is objectively better than you are :D
First time watching live and also first time donating and wanted to donate during one of my favourite games (Binding of Isaac). Good luck to all speedrunners involved in AGDQ, glad to see so many donations already going to such a good cause. Hopefully, there is eventually a cure to or a way to prevent cancer. Also looking forward to the Fallout speedrun.
So excited to see Isaac at another event! It is crazy after all these years the community is still going strong and the evolution of the game has been incredible to watch. Thank you Marcus and couch for showcasing this amazing run. Can't wait for the new content and many more years of Isaac runs to come. Happy 10 years GDQ!
Marcus, bo9 me (on unseeded). Zamiel, the Isaac bossfight in R+ is awesome.
Good luck to everyone at GDQ!
Iiiiiiiiisaaaaaaaac!
Hello AGDQ, long time viewer, first time donator! Perfect time to do it during my favourite game! Thanks to everyone who makes this event happen.I've been meaning to donate earlier than this but never got around to doing it. Now I feel more incentivized to donating since last year, in Febuary, my amazing mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even though she is now declared cancer free thanks to early detection, all of us in the family have been affected by her going through treatment and cancer is never a good time (except in this very game). I hope that the money I can spare can go towards saving lives in the same way my mother-in-law's was. Come on now stream, let's try to beat this disease together! Much love from Sweden! <3
Hi, I've been watching the show for a long time, but this year I have to donate during Isaac's run since a week ago I finally got 3 Million % after years playing this fabulous game.
Let's do this! 10 years of games done slightly faster than normal!
C'est un peu banal mais merci à vous pour cette initiative ! Bon courage pour ce marathon ! #YomiCeleste
Shout out to Marcus, really cool to see someone I'm familiar with representing a game that I've enjoyed watching friends destroy with speed on a daily basis. Take my energy for good mapping!
Binding of Isaac is my most played Steam game. Gonna enjoy that run. Thanks to all speedrunners, event crew, donators and everyone else that made GDQ what it is. Keep up the great work!
finally able to watch the isaac speedrun live with my wife. (she loves this game and finally got 1,000,001 percent). keep up the good work and lets end cancer
On continue à bourrer LFR ! GOGOGO #GDQup (Twitter : @Bunlan__G)

[FR] un gros merci a toute la communauté et a tous les bénévole de soutenir cet événement un grand merci a tout ceux qui ont fait les lots aussi :D des coeurs sur les commentateurs de QUALITEY et des ambianceurs de FOLY #TempeteDeSang
I had to donate during the game that introduced me to my husband. We met in a Twitch chat, he bought me this game to get my attention, and it worked!! We were married in July. We decided to name our daughter, who is due in March, Eve in honor of this game. Glad to see Issac back in a GDQ rotation. Good luck StoneAgeMarcus!!
Thank you 😊 for fighting against cancer.
Had to donate to say thanks to all the couch commentators this event, especially my dear friend Kasper on the Binding of Isaac couch. Here's to another great QDQ!
Spectateur de longue date, je n'avais pas la possibilité de contribuer, mais maintenant je peux enfin donner ma pierre à l'édifice et soutenir cet événement.Nous devons nous mobiliser contre le cancer, Bourrez les dons !#TempeteDivine
First time catching this live, always thought this was an amazing event for a great cause, thank you all for what you do.
Although I have played over 500 hours of Isaac, this is my first time watching a speedrun. Interesting new take on a very interesting game! Good luck Marcus!
Hey kasper just wondering, where’s the lvl 3 shiny wooloo?

You guys are going great! Take care of mom. So nice to see issac back at AGDQ
#CoeurNoir
Love you GDQ
#CoeurNoir
Issac was my game of the decade. I kept coming back to it year after year. Thanks for introducing me to another version of my favorite game. Here's 10¢ for every death on my classic and Afterbirth+ save files.
Greetings from back couch. Good luck on the run, and may all your cards be Emperor. Donations to runners choice
thrilled to see isaac at a gdq. played countless hours and watched even more. good luck to the runner, and shout out to the NL community
Having fun watching Marcus play the Binding of Isaac. Good luck on the run. Go Blue!
Marcus and Daniel, keep up the great work! I'm so proud of both of you.
Wonderful run from Marcus, thank you for running this, and to Edmund for creating such a wonderful franchise. Many memories of trying to get all The Lost achievements on keyboard controls!
The first time I've ever "Had to donate for my favorite game". Congratulations on making me feel like a scrub with only a scant 750 hours between Isaac and Rebirth.
Hey Marcus! Not sure if you saw, but Michigan State crushed U of M today. Good luck on the run, and Go Green!
Thanks y'all
Thanks for showing off this fantastic game and the dedicated communities that have been inspired by it to this day! Here's hoping Krampus doesn't ruin any more Devil Deals.
So great to see an Isaac run at AGDQ! I used to be a semi-competent racer back in my youth and loved every minute of it. By day, I'm a graduate student studying particle physics, so that's a thing. Trust me, it's not as glamorous as it sounds.But in all seriousness, the Isaac racing community is the best there is, and I highly recommend everyone interested to give the game a shot. Best of luck to Marcus on the rest of the characters, go fast and don't die.Your salty friend, Goth.
I'm so glad to see this poggers game being run! Big shout out to my friend RakeDog who showed me this game recently, its a yes from me
Good luck Marcus and shout out to Zam and Kasper for the great commentary! You make the Isaac community proud.
So excited to have AGDQ back and so excited to donate for the first time!

I would have liked to give more if I could.I just lost my dad 2 day ago from cancer so it matters for me to help this cause.

I spent so much time in the binding of isaac, I almost had to repeat junior year of college.
Hey guys! Huge Isaac fan here. So happy to finally see it back at GDQ. I actually am looking to get into speedrunning this game very soon, and I have about 1000 hours played in the game between a few platforms. I'm gonna do my best to be the best runner I can at this game. Good luck with the rest of your run Marcus! I hope I can make my way into the speedrunning community for this wonderful series in the near future!
Afterbirth+ was my second most played game on the Switch in 2019, during 903 total hours of playtime. Had to donate during a game that I've lost ridiculous hours of my life to.
Sonic 2006 in AGDQ? I can't wait to see just how much this game can be absolutely destroyed.
I wish the best to all of you <3
Thanks for the epic shoutout Zam <3

Spent most of high school playing the original Binding of Isaac, love the game to pieces, good luck on the final stages of the run!
First time donating, sadly missed the A Hat in Time race but still thrilled to be donating! Going towards the Sonic 06 run, because that game is wonderful to see broken open even more than usual.
AGDQ is my fav way to start off the new year! I had to donate during the binding of Isaac run on behalf of my friend Goliath, who has almost achieved 3 million percent. Keep up the great work!
Hello from backstage! Shout outs to Kasper and Marcus, hope to see more Isaac at future GDQs

I've been waiting for an Isaac AGDQ for ages and I can't wait to see it come back again. I've clocked in over 500 hours and it's my favourite game of all time - it's nice to see it get the spotlight it deserves! Also, hi beehive!
woooo isaac
Thank you to AGDQ for doing so much to stop cancer. Here's a shoutout to my best friend Cartridgeblowers, you're kicking butt and we can't wait for you to marry us in a few months. Much Love

100 bucks for the D100
An awesome event, and the third year in a row I've donated. Keep pushing on, and keep blowing these games out of the water!
How much for the any% run with the wall of glitch?
For an amazing Binding of Isaac run!
Was going to save my donation for later in the marathon, but after that magnificent Isaac run, had to do it now. As someone who just last year lost one family member to cancer, and had another be diagnosed (although thanks to early detection, it looks like she'll be making it out fine), this event is even more important to me now than it ever was before. You guys are doing great work.
Cette run d'issac était parfaite GG au runner et GG au commentateur ! #CoeurBleu
SMB3 hype!!!
A quick shout out to Cartridgeblowers and that sweet sweet hosting voice! First of many donations, good luck runners!!
always love GDQ time. sad i missed most of isaac but i had to donate. Congrats on the 10 year anniversary and hope we can go another 10!
Frequent watcher of the VODs, but now I'm watching live for only the second time. Put this towards Sonic 06. Terrible game, but great speed game!
That was a fun and fabulous Isaac run!
First time I’ve been able to catch this live! Also on my Birthday no less! Here’s some money to prevent Cancer! Looking forward to the SMB3 race!
Hi Candace, thanks for making a wonderful event like AGDQ even better by being here with me. You make it so much better that it inspired me to write a poem. Roses are red - violets are blue - will you be - my player 2
It was cool to see Isaac back! You do awesome work!
This is for Nat, but not the thyroid that is trying to kill him. He's my favorite person who watches speedruns with me, and a A+ cat petter. You got this, buddy.
LONK
Go for door 3!
Day one of many. Need to spread out my donations, but it's been a fantasic show so far!
Awesome Binding of Isaac run. Great to see it back in the AGDQ line-up with an excellent runner and great commentary. Keep up the great work.

Wanna wish good luck to Mitch, Haxor, and Stewie as they race the objectively best category in SMB3.I'll drop another 25 dollars for EACH runner that attempts THIRD DOOR
Hi AGDQ, I've been looking forward to this run as it brings back fond memories of playing Super Mario 3 at my Grandpa's house. He lost a two year battle to bile duct cancer this past August and while I miss him dearly, he played a big role in my love for video games so he is always with me when I game. Thank you to all the staff who make this event possible, and good luck to all the runners this week!
For my grandma, who is having surgery for kidney cancer tomorrow <3
Already ten years of AGDQ, you guys are on top. Keep up the good work. Big support from a French viewer.
day 1 :)
2020 for the first year I'm able to donate to this great cause. Love what you've all been doing for years. Mario Race Hype!
It's a-me. Mario 3 is my all time favorite game which I do a yearly all exits run during holidays. Can't wait to see what the top players are able to do with this game I have spent so many hours enjoying
Connor; sorry I didn't come over to watch this SMB3 run as a unit. I know what you're thinking, wouldn't it be easier if I just text directly. I leave on the edge Cons.
Isaac back at a GDQ??? HYPE! Happy 10th anniversary!!! Love you guys!

Mario Bros. 3 is the first game I remember playing, so happy to see it at AGDQ and a race to boot!
Long time viewers, first donation. This is how we should start 2020 : by helping people on need while enjoying lots and lots of awesome speedruns with lots and lots of awesome people. My Bro and i wish you lot of success for this year and all the years to come. Lets-a go!!!
Woooooo go Mitch but more importantly the defeat cancer!
Thanks for running this game. Go Mitch! Good luck and thanks for supporting a great cause! Hi to my brother Joe watching on the stream!
Really happy to finally catch the stream live. Thanks to all the volunteers making this possible.
Good luck to all the runners today!
I remember watching AGDQ for the first time back in 2011. Back then i thought "wow, they are doing so much do help prevent cancer, i should do something too". Fast forward to 2020 and i became a doctor, specialising in oncology right now. I just want you guys to know, that these marathons are one of the reasons i decided to become an oncologist. Please accept this small amount as a symbol of my gratitude. Here is to the next 10 years with you guys. Greetings from Cyprus!
My aunt died earlier this year not from cancer, but from complications due to a weakened heart from chemo. I am so happy that my favorite form of entertainment can be used to help raise money to try and stop this from happening to others!Donation incentive towards "NotGroudon" for Kyogre's nickname in Pokemon Saphire for my kids
Thanks AGDQ for doing your part to make the world a better, more cancer free place.
Donating because Mario 3 and the runners are awesome. Though I watch Mitch a bit more, I'm cheering for stewie because he's a cool dude.
HOONK
Donating for Tetrisphere, my favorite Tetris game on any console, with some of the best video game music out there. Good luck to all the runners, and keep being awesome!
Bon courage pour la 1er nuit de marathon ! #DarkMage
Hard to pick my favorite Mario speed runs but it's hard to beat SMB3. Good luck to the runners on what's sure to be an epic race.
This is the first GDQ my girlfriend has seen and she's really excited watch the Super Mario race. She's been really getting into speedrunning and might pick up TMNT herself. Love ya Angela, hope you enjoy the rest of this stacked lineup for GDQ!
Keep fighting the noble fight, AGDQ.
Honk!!!
hey agdq congrats on the 10 years, good luck to all the runners this year!
This town ain't big enough for the two of us

SMB3 hype!!! lets go mitch show us who is the master in smb3 <3...pls no stomp guys
Here to kick off a five dollar hype train. With such amazing viewership we're DEFINITELY not going to break $200,000 before the end of the zelda block. There's simply NO WAY a bunch of people are going to donate $5 to an awesome charity and more than double the donation total by the end of the block. Fast donors at a marathon about going fast? PSHHH. It'll NEVER happen. ;P
Hi everyone! I'm enjoying listening to the dulcet tones of Carti B's voice! Good luck to Mitch in his SMB3 run. Watch out for Barry! Shoutout to my Jabem and all the awesome gamers who are running or watching the games!
Very excited for SMB3 race, here's 25 Dolans towards "Lonk" for the Skyward Sword filename.This event is amazing every year, and is a beautiful example voluntaryism in action <3 Best of luck to the runners. Keep those donations rolling.

Bravo à toute l'équipe LFR pour votre super taf année après année! Go bourrer les dons! #GDQup
Donating as a tribute of the 4th year of meeting my now husband on twitch chat during AGDQ 2016. I love this community.
Been watching GDQ for over 8 years and this is the first time I am able to actually donate! Excited about this SMB3 run! Honk!
Riven and Myst III at AGDQ? How is this possible? As a fan of these games that don't get much attention today, this makes me immensely happy!
Swing your arms from side to side. Come on it's time to go do the Mario! Take one step and then again. Let's do the Mario all together now! Just like that.
Your donation is in another castle. Just kidding!
Quack
I started watching GDQ last year and I found a newfound love for speedrunning! Glad I managed to catch SMB3 and really excited to see Gymnast86 take on Skyward Sword later tonight. My mom passed from cancer almost 5 years ago so I'm happy to give a donation to such a good cause. Also, HONK!
What an amazing start to GDQ! Shout out to my hubby Sharife for first introducing me to speed running!
Its the semi-annual most wonderful time of the year. AGDQ is hype and I know it only gets better.
The run should be save, no poo in sight to stomp the console, good luck everybody
Hey friends, tina here - am I in time for the 100% all coin ships race?
Good luck on the runs!
Thx 4 the lulz
Happy 10 year GDQ! Love these games and watching the players supporting charity. Save the frames! Save the animals! Go Mitch!
I bet Mitchflowerpower is glad Grandpoobear isn't beside him to "encourage console glitches"
Go Haxor!
Go mitchflowerpower! Good luck on the run and here's to 10 years of GDQ!
Ahhh, spaghetti! A raviolli! Mamma mia~!
Took a week off work just to watch AGDQ. Loved most of the the runs over the runs (the ones I was awake for) and I can't wait for more to come. More to come over this week and Dark Master Sword is amazing.One question though, why isn't Sonic '06 with the other sonic games or part of the Awful Games Block? I mean don't we all know its reputation by now???
Wow, 10 years already huh? Here's to another amazing decade.Cancer has been a curse on my family for as long as I can remember, so I'm more than happy to donate to the PCF every year, especially in the name of what has become one of my greatest passions: speedrunning.Best of luck to all three racers. I hope to join you all on the SMB3 leaderboards sometime this year.
I am thrilled to be able to make my first donation to AGDQ. After discovering GDQ a couple years ago it quickly became my favorite gaming event, can't wait to see how high that donation counter can get this year!
SMB 3 was my grandma’s favorite game. She would stay up and I’d watch her play when I couldn’t sleep. We lost her to pancreatic cancer when I was 13. I’m donative for Catherine Harris & so other kids can keep their gamer grannies around. Kill cancer, save the animals.
Congrats to GDQ for 10 years! Racing the classics is a formula for a great run. May the best runner win!

Nouveau don cette année pour lutter contre ce fléau. Ces dernières années n'ont pas été simples pour certains de mes proches qui ont du lutter contre différents cancers.#MarioLight
Have to donate toward point-and-click adventure games! I already missed out on helping the Riven opera Easter egg, so here's some money to save Saavedro in Myst III: Exile. Brad Dourif's character deserves to be saved!
This is the first GDQ I've been able to watch with my dad, who sends his love out to his friends in the Kaizo community. I hope when I'm old enough I can come along to one in person!
All those rage resets and frustrating streams allnlead upnto this! Good luck to all the runners!
Pway my level
Happy 10th Anniversary GDQ!
*honking noises*
Evening esteemed guests. I am proud of everyone here for raising close to $90,000 so far. This SMB3 run is awesome so far and I hope it stays close. Put this money towards Sonic 06 out of morbid curiosity. Keep on grooving all and may Boss Bass go hungry.
Here is some money to save Chucky-- I mean, Grima Wormtongue-- I mean, Brad Dourif-- I mean, Saavedro!
Gotta go fast!
I'm at home sick with the flu, so thank you to all the GDQ staff, volunteers, and runners for making this all the more bearable. Let's go Mitch!
This is for our 12 year old niece Lorelai who just rang the bell on her 8 months of chemo treatments. It's foundations like this that made it possible for her to do so. Thanks to all the runners, donators, and behind the scenes staff (especially the IT people - we are the heart and soul of the backstage).
SMB3 is my favorite game and play of all time (even if I've never beaten it). Go Mootchfleurpour.
SMB3 speed run is a thing of beauty.
*HONK*Translation: Honk.
Here’s to the first Mario run of the new decade! If whoever’s in the lead when the announcer reads this wins, I’ll donate an extra $10. Congrats to GDQ and all its staff on an amazing decade!
Happy 10th anniversary!#MarioLight
YOU GUYS ROCK!! AND ALSO HONK!!!
Shout out to Marcus from the Binding of Isaac Run - much respect for flexing on the boss rush and Hush with the D100.
Boom boom shake shake shake the room kick, kick, kick, boom
Enjoying the Mario 3 race so far, never actually beat it as a child. Also looking forward to the Skyward Sword run later tonight.
For the first time since I've watched GDQ events, I'm in a financial position to be able to donate. I wanted to donate during the event of the person whose runs got me watching them in the first place. Good luck to Mitchflowerpower and all the runners! Save the frames, stop cancer!
Hello from the Czech Republic, you have a great atmosphere there, keep it up and good luck for the racers!
My 5 year old twins are putting this money toward a Thehaxor victory today!
All you need to do is push A.
Donating for a shout out to my lovely wife, Hayley!
towards longevity and the wisdom that comes of it
Love the SM3 100% runs as this was a major game from my childhood. Good luck runners!Donation to leave Saavedro, because if he'd spent ten minutes solving the puzzle that would have gotten him home instead of years plotting his overly complicated revenge plan, we could have avoided this whole mess.
I just lost the GAME

Hi AGDQ, happy 10th anniversary! We're staying up late to watch the SMB3 race, but if you can read our donation before our bedtime then our dad promises to match our donation. Keep up the great work.

Thrilled to be watching the SMB3 race, such good platforming! This year's AGDQ has more meaning for me than most. In November, I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. I'm happy to donate what I can to an organization that aims to make stories like mine more rare. Hoping to get the perler bead mushroom because I need a 1up.

Super Mario Bros 3 was a huge part of my childhood. I have so many fond memories of it. I remember my brother tried to "speedrun" the 100% category. He took a couple of hours beating it. I can see you guys are doing it fast now,

I don't care if you read this donation on stream or not, because it's not about the message; it's about sending money.

Happy 10 year anniversary GDQ. Watching the SMB3 race with my son, Henry. Here is 50$ to prevent cancer.
First time donating to GDQ! I don't really know what to say, so I'll just give a pro speedrunning tip: If you make a mistake in a run, just say it was an RNG manip! Kappa
Hey everyone, glad to be able to donate to another GDQ, and during a run of my favorite game of all time, Mario 3. Happy to contribute to this cause, good luck to all the runners. This one goes to the DKC3 filename WINKY. When him hop, me hap.

I love auto-scrollers! Best levels in the game!
I can't believe I almost missed this!! AGDQ got me into watching speedruns, and thank you for everyone who runs and helps! YOU ROCK!!!
Honk!
Appreciate all the good that you guys do. Keep up the good work.PS. Go Mitch!
Lost a sidebet.
First time donating, and so happy that I can give to such an amazing cause! Congrats on 10 years!!!
I've been watching GDQ live for years, and usually it's a great week off to relax and watch some great entertainment. But this year I've decided to "play along" with some Games Drawn Quick action and draw every game in the marathon. Here's $25 toward Sonic 2006 to make the marathon that bit longer... and give myself even more work!
My fiance and I have been watching GDQ since we first started dating. Now, 4 years later we are attending our first GDQ event and getting married in a month! Thanks for all the great memories!
I had to donate during Mario 3. What an amazing game! Thanks for all the hard work and let's goomba stomp cancer. :)
SMB3 is my favorite game of all time. Always love seeing it run in new ways at GDQ. Good luck to the runners. Bad luck to cancer!
LONK
Honk!
SONIC 06
I love SMB3 but I hate the levels that, like, move on their own. Whatever that's called.
This is my first GDQ watching at home since AGDQ 2018, but I'm enjoying watching some awesome speedruns with my newborn daughter. I'm putting my donation towards naming the Wingull in Pokémon Sapphire Marnie after her.Shoutouts to my friends in the Mario community in attendance! Go Haxor!
For Skyward Sword file name Lonk
Lonk happy to see Skyward Sword run, good luck!
Donating $10 just for Mitch’s controller swag.
I love hex values!Skyward Sword is my favorite speedrun conceptually, so I gotta donate!
Hundo Hype! HONK!
Keep it up mods :)
Hi it's me the host. $25 in support of theHaxor. No hands this time! Is it... wrong for the host to play favorites?
one dollar for every hand I'm expecting to see.
Been watching for six years now, but I'm finally in a position I can donate! Thank you for making such a difference through games, and here's to another 10 years of going fast!
I heard something earlier about a choo-choo train, so i'll do my part as well as 4 others. Another $25 donation if the host can pronounce my name close enough!!
SMB3 is my favorite game! Thanks for the awesome race guys and good luck!

Hey GDQ! We just had a baby on Saturday morning so we're watching GDQ from the postpartum room as a family! Welcome to the world Storm Ryder! Good luck on the run everyone. SMB3 is one of the games we play together most often.
I love Mario, speedruns, and intricate game mechanic discussions. Kudos to the detailed tech commentary for the SMB3 race, to the fantastic runners and this amazing event.
Heard the $25 donation for the $5 train read and decided I’d match it.

Effie, August, and their dad are cheering for Mitch, but we hope all the runners kick Bowser’s butt as hard as GDQ is battling cancer. Good luck to all!
So I hear AGDQ has moved south this year. Are the runners feeling a little hot under the collar? Donation to winner’s choice.
This race is an awesome start to GDQ. Let's go!

Donating for the awesome Mario Zone cross stitch; I'm a stitcher myself and SML2 was the first Mario game I got to the last level on.
I always love when GDQ comes around each year. Here's to a great SMB3 run and to a great GDQ!
The Bowser’s Navy level in SMB3 is in a lake of blood. If you look at the map, it’s shaped like a koopa skull. Happy swimming!
Watching AGDQ with my amazing wife, here's to a great event and cause!
I'm new to the speed running world, but I love it. And I love the GDQ events. I'm glad to donate to such an awesome cause. I hope to run a game at AGDQ myself someday!
Hype!
First time watching this live, and honestly I can't wait to see all of the upcoming games! May the RNG Gods be with you!
Enjoying the SMB3 race; This is my first time catching GDQ live, today is my birthday. The 35 cents is because I’m 35 today. How about a happy birthday from the crowd?
Stewie!!!!!!
Had to donate during this HYPED game! Kick Bowser butt for me!
For the awesome SMB3 racers, my very first GDQ donation! How could I not in Mitch's honor?

I loooove Zelda games. My favorite has to be Links Awakening for the Switch, but I love all the 3D ones too. Donating for the file name to be Lonk. The best Zelda character.
I'm just here for Goose- I mean Groose.
I always adore watching Games Done Quick. One of my favourite speedruns from AGDQ 2019 was the 9 hour, Final Fantasy IX run. I watched every single second.
GL & HF Gymnast! Much love from the Discord crew! Lets get that Extended Blow.
Skyward Sword is my favorite Zelda game! One of my favorite memories is making my wife play it for the first time while she was still my girlfriend in college. I love you, Prumm!
#MarioLight
Fun fact: Skyward Sword came out on my birthday. So I have to donate for my birthday game!

Greetings from Montreal,Quebec!I've been watching GDQ for many years now but never been able to donate before.Lost my grandfather to cancer so it is my pleasure to support this great cause.
Just got home from the most incredible MAGfest, and what better way to decompress than to get cozy and watch GDQ. Best of luck to the runners, 100k HYPE!
I've watched GDQ for years and am excited to make it to another great marathon. Zelda games have been always my favorite, Skyward Sword close to the top. Here's to another amazing week. HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPPPPPPPPPEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
By my calculations, there is a 99% chance that we will break $3 million in donations this year.
HONK
Late last year my trombone professor's wife passed away from cancer. I got an unexpected bonus check from a gig this summer, so here's to Gloria.
Thanks for the amazing cause
Hi Steve!
I been looking forward to the Skyward Sword run ever since I saw it on the schedule. Good luck to gymnast, let's get first try barrier skip - waaaaait.
The same procedure as every year :). Thx !
$10 for 10 years thanks for all the awsome runs.
There are no bad Zelda games. Here's to showing some love for one of the more, er, divisive entries in the series.
Here's to another excellent GDQ event and to many, many more. I hope to see the 20 year anniversary.
Hoping to win the N64 :) Loved watching GDQ the past decade, here's to another decade!
Could not just sit here and watch, had to get on the train... Here is a little something to help in the fight against cancer. 100k hype!!
I like turtles!.. herm.. I mean, trains! Choo Choo
Wanted to donate during Gym's run because he's great and I've never played Skyward Sword before. I've heard it's the "bad" Zelda and I'm excited for him to disprove that!
Thanks for hosting your 10 year anniversary in my hometown, Orlando, Florida! Keep up the GREAT work guys!
Been watching GDQ for years, but this year is the first time I'm in a position to be able to donate. NEVER stop GDQ, it's the best community on the internet. Save frames, stop cancer!! <3 <3

GDQ is the best! Thankful for everything this community does.

Bonne chance pour la suite :) . #ConseilDes4
$100,000 on the first day? Wow!

My mom is recovering from a double mastectomy and she’s doing fantastic. Keep up the great work for this amazing cause
it's so cool to see how much this run has progressed since the last GDQ. props to gym for doing such an awesome job breaking this game. lets start a 5$ train to celebrate! HYPE!
Donating in memory of my grandfather who died from cancer not too long ago.
Looked at my total giving from 2019 a few days ago... and it only reached about a quarter of the 10%-of-income I was aiming for. Here's to contributing something significant, and not just enough to feel good about myself; here's to putting money somewhere more useful than my savings account.
A little donation for a good cause!Should I have the time for a stream of my own anytime soon, I will do another donation matching my ammount of max viewers ×2 (even though I usually don't have much ^^').Hope the last year can again be beaten witg the donations!
I love watching AGDQ with my dad! To all those involved, thank you for all you do!
Looking forward to seeing some amazing runs! Hyped for the Zelda runs!
10 years strong! Let's keep this moving!

100k first day!
I love GDQ, I love KungFuFruitCup (and her rad hair), but most importantly, I love helping people in any way I can. My mother passed away from breast cancer in 1992, when I was 7, so I've always had a personal vendetta against that dreaded disease. Let's take cancer down together, everybody!
The 5 Dollar train is nice and all, but we know, that not everyone can donate. So here I cover some more people, just so that others don't have to feel bad.
Long time viewer first time donator. Love this event and watch both AGDQ and SGDQ every year.
Skyward Sword was the first Zelda game I beat and is one of my favorite games. Donating for Zelda, Wii Motion Plus, and for my mom who recently began her battle with cancer. Thanks GDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation!

Shout out to dancing guy. You're the best dancing guy.
Home sick with the flu, but gives me more time to watch the stream! My mom has survived cancer five times as of this September, had to donate to this great cause during a Zelda game!
First time tuning in live and excited to donate to such a great cause! Skyward Sword was one of my favorite games as a kid. I spent so many hours getting it to 100% on both normal and hero mode, so seeing it getting totally broken by Gymnast will make it all feel worth it.
Wow 100000 that’s a lot
BONUS GAME GET!
Lets keep these donations "Skyward"! $100,000 HYPE!
Hey AGDQ, long time watcher, first time donating. Chipping in $10 for 10 years of awesome events and a great cause. If this is read out and the reader gets my name right on the first try, I'll do another $10. Money goes towards reader's choice.
I was watching Myst Let's Plays before it was cool--I sat and watched Dad while he played. Myst III was the first game in the series I beat on my own with no hints. So very happy to see Myst get some love here!
This is the second DGQ i'm watching!!! I can't wait for Gym to play Zelda!!! HONK and UWU UWU UWU UWU UWU UWU UWU UWU

I may not have been able to make it to this year's GDQ, but I'm more than happy to support the cause.
This donation is for all of the caregivers that support all of the people who are effected by cancer. It's such a difficult, and often selfless role, to make someone's battle through cancer a little bit easier. Thank you all for all that you do.Kick cancers booty before it starts!
Good luck on the run Gym, here's hoping you bring the final boss a...swift Demise.How could I donate without a delightful pun? Much love to you all at this wonderful event!

It's an honor to be donating money and prizes to another GDQ event. I just discovered speedrunning in 2017 and had to get involved. The community is incredible, and I cannot wait to see what AGDQ 2030 ends up being like. I bet it will be nothing like any of us can imagine right now. This is the first of several donations I'll be making this week, so until the next one... HONK!!!!!
In memory of my Dad, who taught me to play videogames
HONK
Been watching GDQ for most of the 10 years it’s been running, I often use it as an example in my classes for how you can make a difference with whatever your passion is. Gymnast is one of my favourite runners and I think he does an amazing job explaining his run as he goes. Always impressed.
Skyward Sword Hype!!
Longtme AGDQ fan who felt this cause hit closer to home recently as my mom, just before the holidays, was diagnosed with stage 4 glioblastoma, a rare and aggressive brain cancer. this donation is for her and everyone else dealt a critical hit in life. thanks to all the speedrunners, staff and those who've donated to helping crush cancer.
Didn't want to donate a second time today, but the prices just made me spend more money. Now where should we put that money towards? How about... naming the character for the Fallout Anthology "Honk"? I honk this might be a honking good idea, honk. Good honk on the run, Gym!
Super happy to donate. Hoping for that Gold 64.
First time I've managed to catch a GDQ event live after coming across the youtube videos. I had to donate for an amazing event. Big shout out to all the organisers and the runners.
Hundo Honk Hype!

Love Skyward Sword! Good luck Gymnast
Jumping on the Honk train! As a game developer it warms my heart to see the immense good that games and gamers can bring to the world! Go get 'em Gymnast! HONK!

Hello I am a first to give but I always watch what I like plus a bit more
Happy to donate to a great cause like this. Love watching these streams! Keep up the great work everyone!HONK!!
Been watching since 2013, donated every year! Somehow I've never played a Zelda game before, I know what I'll be doing with my time next weekend :)...And HONK!
Congratulations on 10 years, GDQ. Shout outs to my boyfriend jewker for being a huge nerd and watching this with me, despite being states apart.
First time catching live and had to donate. Wow Skyward Sword when did you get so fast! Good luck Gymnast! Looking forward to seeing the Myst block tomorrow after work. Good luck to those 3 runners as well. Hype!

Watching the marathon with my family, LOVING all these great runs! It's wild how much the SS run has sped up since we last saw it! Best of luck on the run Gymnast! Honk!
My best friend's dad was recently found to have leukemia but thanks to cutting edge treatment I'm happy to say he's on track to beating it completely! I've been donating to GDQ what I can for a few years now and I don't see myself stopping soon. Putting this towards the bonus Sonic 06 run, because that game is weirdly only playable when speedrunning and that's hilarious to me.
Honk!
HONK!
Hi Gymnast! I love your streams, and good luck on the run! Good luck with your RBMs and show us how it's done, Game Boy!

Hey guys, it's your friendly neighborhood gamer here! I don't have much WISDOM on speedruns, but being able to do a run like this must take a lot of COURAGE. Remember to embrace the POWER within! Sorry, I won't TRI to FORCE any more puns into this donation. Super excited for this run, so good luck Gymnast!P.S. HOOOOOOOOONK!
I've been waiting for this run since it got accepted! watching the speedrun develop over this year has been a great time, and gymnast is an awesomely fun runner to watch. This donation goes to the sonic 06 bonus game, because it's the game that got me into speedrunning (and so in a roundabout way, legend of zelda too.)
WAGGLE TIME!
Hey guys! First time watching GDQ live! Thanks for all you guys do and let's have fun together. Honk!
Best wishes to the runner! HONK!
If I could get the couch to do their best impression of Link's grunt/scream I would be grateful. Thanks to all of the volunteers everybody working behind the scenes!

Congratulations to GDQ for the 10 years of operation. You've done a fantastic job and I'm looking forward to another decade of events. Good luck on to the runners. This donation is going towards the Sonic 2006 incentive.
Honk!
Hey y'all! Been watching these events for years and what y'all do is absolutely inspiring. My boyfriend and I always love snuggling up on the couch and watching our favorite games get 360 no-scoped for a great cause, so I had to donate during one of his personal favorites. Love you, Yellyfeesh; being with you is the greatest adventure of all.

I'm so excited to be here at my first GDQ to watch Gym run Skyward sword in person! This is the run I've been looking forward to the most. Gym, thank you for always being so welcoming on your streams and explaining things so well to your viewers. You've inspired me to try speedrunning someday. Good luck tonight!
5 dollars train during the legend of zelda: Honk adventure is awesome! HONK !

It's time for a wonderful AGDQ again, and somehow I have most of the week off. So basically... time for my wallet to really start crying. Here's to a bunch of great runs for a wonderful cause.I've had fun looking at how quickly Gym and the others have gotten the Skyward Sword speedrun down over the past few months. Here's hoping it goes better with... oh boy he's keeping on dying what a shame (kidding 0ω0)
I've been watching GDQ since my husband and I started dating 6 years ago. This is our first GDQ as husband and wife! As usual, donating during a Zelda run. Thank you for your hard work in the fight against cancer!

Another GDQ, another fantastic lineup, and another great week! Looking forward to the runs!
Honk! Do not bonk; it makes you look like a donk!
Donating in honor and dear memory of my mother, who died in November following a battle with cancer. She always loved the Zelda series, so it's an honor to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation during this slick Zelda run. Good luck to Gymnast and all the GDQ runners! HONK!
Donating during my favourite Zelda game, love the event - keep up the good work!...and also... HONK!

Hello gymnast. I hope you know that I I am still planning to dominate the world. I hope this helps. Let's get those gymnast agd KYU's!!!
I don't have much to say, but its cool to play Breath of The Wild while watching Skyward Sword and the hero named Honk!
Great charity. Much of my family has faced cancer. Thanks for this.
A dear friend of mine is currently fighting cancer, which was unfortunately caught quite far along. It is my hope that through prevention and early detection one day no one else will ever have to go through this fight. Thank you GDQ for all that you do <3 Honk!
Zelda? Honking? Ah yes, it must finally be time for Untitled Groose Game.

Can't believe it's been 10 years already! I've been watching since the beginning and tune in every year to watch some amazing runs. My wife has recently been diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer. If my money can go towards making her life as long and as happy as possible, then it's worth every single penny. Please put my donation towards 3rd Climax in Bayonetta 2. HONK!

After following AGDQ for years, I'm excited that I'm finally in a position to donate, ESPECIALLY during a Zelda game, probably my favorite franchise of all time. Good luck to all the runners, and thank you to everyone who has made this event possible!
Honks done QUACK T-shirt when?

Hey Gym! Been watching you for a while. Good luck on your run! Been a long-time viewer of GDQ and I'm finally in a position where I can donate and help out! My best friend, my father, overcame esophageal cancer a few years back so this cause means a lot to me. It is SO amazing what this community does every year. I want to thank everyone that puts this awesome event together and all the runners/annoucers that give up their time to entertain us. Thank you to all the donators and the Prevent Cancer foundation. HONK!

Gonna keep donating until I get a big HONKING shout-out to my wife, Prumm! I love you!
Bad luck on the extending blow, but there's still Honk
Mess with the Honk you get the Lonk
This is a reminder to stay hydrated.
Congrats GDQ on a decade of speed-running! Though I do fear for everyone's safety as Gym is not using a wrist-strap with his Wii-mote.... Best of luck to all the runners!
Take my Energie hello from Paris !

Excited to donate for our first time to such an awesome cause! Even more excited to watch Skyward Sword get destroyed!! HOOOONK!!!
Hero mode... more like...HONK MODE. My husband thinks that this goose might be robbing people but hey, as long as it’s for charity. I have a proposition for twitch chat for our own hero mode speedrun, how about a quarter mil by midnight?? And why not do it in cacophonous chaos. The rules of this speedrun are simple. Just one dollar to honk, and use your monthly amazon prime twitch sub on GDQ to add another bell to the pile.HONK! MODE! HYPE!
Kikwis are the cutest!!! Also I like your shirt GYMNAST86! Thank you for running Skyward Sword!
I'm so exited to see Skyward Sword here and it's been a fantastic run so far. Can I get a HONK!
Good Luck to the runners!
Hey guys, hope ya'll are keeping hydrated! Thanks for putting this on each Winter/Summer, and for keeping the event going into 2020, a new decade! I watch for LoZ and classic games every year, so here's $10 for the last 10 years and $10 for the next 10 years! I shall not be honking - I'll instead say to "Save the Animals" because frames are for chumps!
Greatings from Sweden! Had do stay awake for the Zelda run with Gymnast!Shout out to Rhi and Chris who I hope are watching in LA! Hi Guys!(Hope this gets read out loud) :D
Some rupees are red,some Bokoblins are blue.This Skyward Sword speedrun is legendary,and so is AGDQ!Happy 10th Anniversary, AGDQ! And thanks to all who made this milestone possible. If we can beat these awesome games, then we can beat cancer.Honk!
Hey everyone had to donate when my man gymnast was running love the run love the event lets kick cancers butt!!! HONK!
Loving this run, it’s so amazing how half of it takes place on the main screen and makes no sense at all.
My favorite Zelda game of all time... Isn't in this marathon. But Skyward Sword is a solid 19th place, so it's good enough!
This run is insane, and Gymnast66 is showing so much skill with all of the file manipulation and skill in Skyward sword. I can't get enough of this run! Money goes to runner's choice.
Skyward sword is my least favourite Zelda game and I tune in to GDQ to watch you guys destroy it. HONK!
More like Untitled Groose Game. Honk!

With Honk dying in lava so much, I guess you could say....His goose was cooked
I've watched since around 2013 but this is the first time I've been able to donate. I LOVE GDQ; I love, and am fascinated by speedrunning. I hope to attend an event in person some day, as either a runner or viewer. Thank you for hosting this and supporting research, it's a fun way to help a serious problem; best wishes to all.

Hey, Gymnast! Breaking my sleep schedule a bit to watch your run here... no pressure *honks in sleep*
Hey gymnast86, great seeing you at agdq! Say hi to the other 85 gymnasts for me!
I'm super excited for the FFVIII run! Thank you guys for everything you do. Awesome cause.
HONK!
Hi there ! I know my girlfriend is watching this since this game in one of her favorite, can you juste say: "I love you SuperStephh" ? Thanks a lot !
Ah yes, my favorite time of the year. GDQ is always a good time. Sending love from New York!
#gymnast Hey Gym! You may want to pick up the pace a bit, you're an hour into the run and still on the title screen. All jokes aside, best of luck, and thanks to everyone who makes GDQ possible.
My very first GDQ donation. Getting it in on the first day, and I can't wait until we beat the record and hit 4mil. My very first HYPE!!!
Hey Gymnast, Woody & Paulinchen here... Good luck on the run and, if Ghirahonk blocks your way...don't honk -- just bonk! :-)
The first GDQ of the nw decade is here, and so far it's been azwesome! So here's my first donation of the decade, which I have decided to place during these Skyward Shenanigans! Looking forward to all the awesome runs this week, and let's at least make that three million mark again!
Salut les Kongs, bel effort sur le premier défi fr, on se laisse pas abattre ! Rendons hommage à la CGI à la française, fleuron du tournant à l'an 2000. Nous renommons le fichier de sauvegarde de Donkey Kong Country 3 DKTV. Merci encore à tous pour la présence, bon stream, gardez la pêche !

Hey, Focus here! Absolutely loving this Skyward Sword run and it’s been a blast being here for my first GDQ. My grandmother recently (who lives in the Orlando area) has unfortunately succumbed to brain cancer again, and doesn’t have a long prognosis. I’m fortunate to be in the presence of amazing speedrunners, commentators and staff; not to mention running here myself has been a lifelong dream. Good luck, Gym.

Lots of love for running this classic Zelda game! May your stamina meter remain a quarter full and your hearts perpetually at two. Honk!
Sending out a S5 dono for this great cause. Pulling a late night of storyboard work and GDQ is getting me through it. Thank you all... And Honk!
There is no escape from the Honk. The Honk is eternal. Also, OOOORRRBBB.
First gdq donation. Lets go gamers!
Hello people from GDQ! Always have a fun time watching these events and I always love donating. Here’s to GDQ and it’s future. Also I needed to donate for Sonic 06 that’s gonna be fun as heck :3

Congratulations on 10 years of GDQ! Day 1 has been amazing and this Skyward Sword run is impressive! Go Gymnast! Honk!
super excited to see a skyward sword run! keep it up!
Had to donate during my all-time favorite franchise! Keep up the amazing runs and may the (tri)force be with you all!
Thank you runners, couch, and event organizers!
GDQ is like the All Star Game of video games. It showcases the most talented players doing their most impressive feats without it being about winning or losing: 100% fun. And as if that weren't enough, it fights cancer. Love it.
Looking forward to the Myst block!
Lonk HONK!
Hey AGDQ. I really appreciate this event when it's live, but also rewatch runs whenever I have panic attacks. Keep doing what you do, as AGDQ helps in a lot of people in more ways than one. If this event has helped you in anyway, then join me in a donation. Thanks again.
Hello GDQ! Ten whole years, and hopefully many to come. I love that an event I enjoy supports a cause I believe in. It’s been so fun watching Gym completely decimate this game over these past months, and the payoff is so sweet. Keep up the good work everyone! Donation goes to naming the character Zapp Brannigan in The Outer Worlds
Hey first time seeing agdq online but watched on youtube alot. Keep up the great work and dont stop what y'all do. Its awesome!
Can we change Skyward Sword's name to Mistitled Groose Game?

Seeing the evolution of Zelda file names at GDQ from Link to Lunk to Lonk, and now to Honk? I love it! Keep up the good work, and shoutouts to the staff behind the scenes!
Watching GDQ with some friends on our living room couch - hi Tim!
Hi, everyone! Long time GDQ fan here :) Keep up the amazing runs and be sure to save the animals!
Hey Gym! You're killin' the run so far, seriously impressive! Wanted to drop a donation from me and my girlfriend, who recently lost her mother to cancer last October. We hope this money can save even one person's life!
I have insider information regarding the sequel to Breath of the Wild.The new Zelda game will be called The Legend of Zelda: Hero of Noble Kleptomania. This iteration of Link will actually be a harmless bird who steals various items from the members of Ganondorf's regime and uses them to bring peace to Hyrule. We know this is a big change from the style of gameplay seen in Breath of the Wild, but we think it will be a welcome one.(read the next line out loud):Announcer, can you give me the best HONK you can muster? Only honk though; don't actually read this part out loud thanks

Hi Gym, I am your archenemy, good luck with your run! You failed the circles so donating to compensate yet again!

Loving this SS run! I love informative runs, and this is the best of the best at that.
Best of luck to the runners! Getting in my donation before I pass out for the night. HONK!!!
We woke up at 3am to watch Gymnast HONK! his way through Skyward Sword. Greetings from Finland, congrats to AGDQ for 10 years of awesome speedruns! HONK HYPE!
This skyward sword run is awesome! It's making me look forward to the Zelda block later in the week. Specifically The Adventure of Honk! and A Honk! to the Past.
Hey Guys,lost my mother to cancer 4 years ago and I am just very thankfull for what you are doing. For everyone please rather get urself checked early than late. You guys are super entertaining, thanks for what you do!
I love watching AGDQ every time it comes around! So glad I logged on in time to catch these amazing runs. Good luck to all the runners! Oh, and HONK!!
Skyward Sword is the first game I ever owned, and Gymnast is the speedrunner who inspired me to learn how to speedrun in the first place! Great game, great runner, great event. Good luck with the run, Gymnast!

AGDQ is wonderful to watch every year, thank you everyone!! UwU!
Strapped for cash, but lost a loved one over the holidays, so we definitely feel the need to donate. Been watching GDQ for years to brighten our days. Gymnast is one of our favorite runners and the Zelda series is the absolute best. Thank you all so much for doing what you do.
Thanks for all you do! This is an incredible organization and means even more to my since learning my dad was diagnosed with stage 2 prostate cancer. Luckily, due to early detection, it is treatable.
Today is my birthday and I couldn't think of a better way to spend it than watching AGDQ. Thank you to everyone who makes these events possible. Good luck to the runner.
Hey guys, I just donated during a loading screen, i want everyone in chat to donate $11 at 11:11 when i switch from file 1 to file 2 and lets fight this cancer 1 meme at a time
First time donating, glad to actually be on while this is happening
Every year I empty out my change jar and donate what's inside to AGDQ. Happy 10 years and here's to 10 more!
Thank you for the great content and for supporting such a worthy cause. Love what y’all do.
I've been watching these awesome events since 2011. I missed the summer event cos of work so here's something to compensate.

HUNK! Wait, no, that's not right...
GDQ knows how to make me smile. I really like the new phrase this year. What is it again? Oh yeah, HONK!
First time watching GDQ live instead of on YouTube after the event. Wanted to make sure I donated during Skyward Sword because I enjoy watching Gymnast86's speedruns. Good luck!
I'm pretty sure the Back In Time glitch was invented by the Goose. It's exactly the sort of thing the Goose would come up with. HONK!
I look forward to this event every time it comes around. Thanks for everything you do....... Oh why not, HONK!
Shoutouts to Ancient Cistern, the best dungeon in the worst Legend of Zelda game! :D (Just kidding, Zelda II is the worst.)
HONKING shout-out to my wife, Prumm! I love you!
You just have to donate during this awesome run. Donation to Runners choice!
This donation during Skyward Sword is for my friend Krys who had to deal with cancer striking personally in their life. While they may grump about Christmas gifts, I know they will appreciate seeing money going to this good cause! His gift can also be saving Saavedro, I hope!
HONK!
$5 train hype!
Made a new years resolution to go to the gym; so here I am watching his run! Best of luck!! Thanks for the great photo with Linkus!
They keep talking about going back in time, but I don't see any ocarinas? This run has been facinating, good luck to all runners this week! (HONK!)
Donating to say hi to my brother Dane, who is also watching. What's up bro?
The Legend of Zelda means so much to me, so getting to watch you all play while contributing to a great cause is the best! I love watching you all play, it's so chill and I feel like we're all in the same living room, just hanging out! Have a great GDQ, hype for HONK!
Love you Zach <3 for Nana.
Donating for my friend Tommy who just lost a loved one to cancer. Hoping that we can find a cure so that nobody will have to go through the pain of cancer.

Another GDQ, I'm so excited! I made sure to donate at least a little bit this year, as I lost two family members not too long ago to cancer. I hope to donate more before the event is over. Good luck and blessed RNG to all of the runners! Save those frames, and beat those games.
$5 train hype! Also, here's a random Zelda fact: Did you know that Skyward Sword, Breath of the Wild and the Wii version of Twilight Princess are the only Zelda games in which Link is right-handed? In all other games he's a Lefty.
So close to unlocking Rescue 10-10 for Tetrisphere! Choo choo!
Attending GDQ last year was a memorable week for me, and I'm excited to see what this year is gonna bring. Happy 2020, here's 10 dollars for 10 years.
I've been watching GDQ for 8+ years. I have yet to miss one, and I try to watch as much as I can each time.I never thought it would happen, but recently my father was diagnosed with cancer. Despite the optimism of friends and family, nothing cheers me up like some good 'ol Zelda glitch runs during GDQ. Thank you, and GLHF!

Finally beat this game just this past summer after years of complaining about the controls. Not my favorite Zelda, but I'll double my money if the couch, the runner, the crowd, whoever, can give me their best rendition of the greatest song in the Zelda franchise: The Groose theme!
Shoutouts to all the people that can't afford to donate, but still take time out of their day to watch and appreciate everything this marathon stands for. We love you, plebs! ♥ Honk!
Honk
Did someone say honk train? Hooooonk!
Keep up the great work!
Absolutely had to give for the Myst runs!! Since the Riven incentive has already been met, I'm voting to save Saavedro in Exile. Give the man a break!
Bonk!? Or HONK!?
Shout out to one of the best 3D Zelda dungeon/boss combos: the Ancient Cistern and Koloktos.And of course...QUACK.....wait, I mean LONK.........I'm bad at this.
I've been watching AGDQ for the past 4 years and I've always loved watching speed runs of the games I've played all my life, really loving the Skyward Sword run, keep it up Gymnast! HOOOOOONK

Thanks to all the staff and runners for another great event! Happy 10th anniversary! HONK!
Thank you to all involved for the wonderful runs and helping PCF. Cancer took my best friend and tried to take family too, but my Grandmother is still alive due to early detection.
Good luck on your run, and by the way... HONK!
Fun Zelda Trivia! During development, Skyward Sword was tentatively called "Untitled Groose Game". Honk!
I was going to donate every time we heard a HONK but some goose in a green tunic stole my wallet, then warped back in time?
With all these honks I'd think this was Untitled Goose Game.
My mother is in the hospital right now due to cancer sadly. thanks for AGDQ and speedrunners for doing what they do.Also HONK!!!
Bless you all
This donation is dedicated to the memory of my friend Rook who passed on January 3rd. We miss you, we love you.
Tetrisphere doesn't get enough attention for how unique it is for tetris. Let's see FFR beat rescue 10-10
who says "who says "we have a $10 donation from "we have a $10 donation from"""
Despite what people say about Skyward Sword, I can still remember the summer I listened to the 25th-anniversary cd that followed with it on my cd player over and over again with good memories when I wasn't playing the game. Good luck with all the runs!
I was stoked for Myst when I got here and I'm even more stoked for it now! Pointing, clicking... It's like an adventure! Lots of fond memories playing this series with my mom as a kid. Best of luck to all the runners!
"Honk", the new "orb"? What a way to be. Good luck to all the runners this week. HONK!
I don't know what all the honking is about but my husband introduced me to GDQ AND Zelda and we are celebrating 10 years together! Go Gymnast86!!
Hello, first time donator, long time GDQ fan! I've loved this event for such a long time, and I love and appreciate all that you for charity! I'm watching the Skyward Sword run with my boyfriend this year and I couldn't be happier! Good luck and.... H O N K !!!!
Hey gymnast. Just wanted to thank you for a very informative and honking great time. Keep up the great work. You really quacked the crowed up.
All I wanted was just one HONKOne tiny little innocent HONKHow can you say that you don't give a HONKI find myself stupefied, going back in time
HONK
Having a blast watching gymnast play the Legend of Honk! Here's to making the bonus game incentive and helping the prevent cancer foundation.

I feel like the Zelda community missed an opportunity by calling it Back in Time instead of A Link to The Past. P.S. BROTHERS, THE HONKENING IS NEIGH!
Long-time watcher, first-time donator. I'd be a _goose_ not to donate to this excellent Skyward Sword run. All love to the runners and everyone working hard behind the scenes!

Glad to see Cadence of Hyrule opened the door to partnerships like Untitled Honk Game. Awesome shirt, Gymnast, and finish strong. HONK!
Been watching GDQ for many years now and am finally in a financial position to donate. It is so awesome what you guys do here at GDQ. It's so exciting to watch so many people of the speedrunning community getting together and raising so much money for such a good cause. So excited to watch so many amazing runners this week, good luck to all!!
Hyped for gymnast run of skyward s’honk’d but also the run of honk’arina of time ! HONK!
Please stop it. It's not funny anymore.
Hello~!! or should I say HONK!!!!!!!!!This is my first year being able to catch a GDQ and so I decided to donate during one of my favorite Zelda games!
HONK
$10 per bonk in Skyward Sword. There's a Groose loose in the hoose. There is no honk, there is only...BOOOOOONK!
Excited to have GDQ back! Two of my good friends were diagnosed with rare cancers this fall, so I'm especially grateful for the event this year.The only question I have is: Has the untitled goose's HONK replaced my man Waluigi? If so, I can only say WAAAAAAAAAAAA!
HONK!!!!
Hello from Seattle! I'm giving my donation to saving Saavedro because I have a soft spot for the series' second-best villain. So glad to finally see this series run and I'm sorry I couldn't be there myself. Best of luck to Gelly, Zaustus, and Flapjack, and hello to all the other Myst runners watching right now.
Gymnast truly is the last jedi
Holy moly! Nice final boss blindfold kill!
Here's a donation for blindfolded honk.
Happy New Year everyone! And hope you all have had a wonderful marathon thus far!I'm always happy to give a donation to Prevent Cancer, especially considering cancer's tragic history on both sides of my family.Let's keep breaking barriers and make this AGDQ the best one ever.Shoutouts to the Speedrunner Furs community. I love you all. <3Will give another $50 if Wolf can do the tank/t-rex section damageless!
Was planning on donating later in the event but HAD to start as soon as I saw the blindfolded demise fight, gymnast is a LEGEND!
Amazing runs!!!
Great Zelda run let's go Dino Crisis 2!!!
Usually 2.5 hour runs have less exciting parts, but the runner and couch kept things interesting the whole time. Great job! :D
I just want to say that was an amazing Skyward Sword run. I got Groose Bumps.
Great work everyone! I've always enjoyed these runs and for such a good cause. Hopefully I can attend in the future.

That Skyward Sword run was amazing and today has been a great start to the week. Thanks to everyone who makes GDQ happen for getting so much support to a great cause and helping me get through the work week. Here's 100 bucks for Sonic 06.
10 Years of AGDQ I'll donate and HONK HONK for that
Can't believe it's time for another GDQ. Excited for a week of fast runs and great commentary!
I'm glad that I can catch GDQ so early this year, and that I have the means to contribute! GDQ Hype!!
M
Premier don pour cette édition (loin d'être le dernier), bonne semaine tout le monde et bourrez les dons ! #Kyogre
Won't be around for Bomberman later, so I'm dropping this donation early. I'll be back tomorrow ;)
This is my first time watching GDQ in real time, and my first time donating. The Myst games have always had a special place in my heart, and I can't wait to see these speedruns!
Thank you all for your efforts for this charity. My father-in-law was a HUGE gamer even in his 70s, and we recently lost him to cancer. He and I both love the Myst series, and I'm excited to see those runs. Cyan Studios deserves all the kudos in the world, especially for getting so many people into games. Find the pages.
I've watched for the last couple years, and made a 16 hour drive to make the decade year!! Lost my mother and grandfather to Cancer and hope we can beat Cancer as well as these runners are beating these games!! Greetings from the front row!!
AGDQ is amazing! Gotta go fast!
Thanks to everyone who makes these events possible. Amazing Skyward Sword run, and I'm looking forward to the rest of the week! Honk!
Myst is one of my favorite game series that I never beat when I was a child because I didn't have enough patience or understanding to play puzzle games. I need to go back and try again now that I have a better of idea where even to begin with them. Good luck and Go fast! Myst Hype!
I love what you gamers do to better the world! My New year's resolution... start speedrunning games!
View the donation, donate the viewer
Saavedro does not deserve to be left in anguish.
Un petit don avant de partir au boulot, courage à ceux qui doivent ce lever tôt et merci au commentateur qui nous accompagne jusque tard le soir ! #DVVol2
A small donation in honor of my Uncle Bill, who passed away earlier today after a long, hard-fought battle with cancer. I'm looking forward to a time where no one has to fear losing someone to cancer again. Love you, Uncle Bill!
My mother is currently lying in hospice due to cancer. She is expected to die within the next two weeks. Hopefully, we can prevent anyone else from suffering the ravages of this horrible disease. This donation is in honor of her.
Shout out to my older brother KujakuDM. He survived his battle with cancer when we were both younger. I’ll never forget visiting him in the hospital and watching him play one of his favorite games. Dino Crisis 2. Love ya Ken.
Hail Prevent Cancer Foundation! Hail GDQ for making this possible! Hail everyone that has donated towards this great event! Let us destroy cancer in our lifetime!
Myst at GDQ taking "it's not a spoiler you've had so many years to play it" to a whole new level
I am terrible at comments. So pretend I said something funny related to geese. Also, Hi Chris.
Hi to Deo in the audience! Love Charlie and Mommy from upstairs
Currently sick with a cold but that's okay when I have a week of awesome speedruns to keep me company! Good luck to all the runners - and a special shout-out to the Megalovania dance break that happened earlier. :)

Save the animals.
I GOT POISONED
Had to donate this year as I couldn't during SGDQ. Also during one of my favourite games. Gl and run fast.I lost my Uncle to cancer a year ago and it's still one of the hardest things for me to deal with as he was the only farther figure I had in my life. So seeing a charity here to help prevent and stop cancer is always really nice, love the work you guys do every year and love watching you beat games as fast as possible!
(In Chicago they drop Sue the T-Rex's skull to signal the start of the New Year.)
Hey, first time donating, hope you guys are having a great time, good luck and have fun with the runs!
as always, gdq doing whats best, thank you guys for continuing this amazing event! I want to see records! keep the donations coming everyone!

Congrats Wolf for your 2nd GDQ and your excellent choice of couchmates! Lookin' fabulous as always, LAYTA BEE!
Long time watcher, finally able to be here in person. Here's hoping GDQ's 10th anniversary can break last summer's record.
Donating $79.93, the price of the Myst 25th Anniversary Collection, since I was so excited that I could finally purchase Myst 4. I went right to steam and bought it as soon as it was mentioned on stream. Donating to leave Saavedro since I can't bring myself to do it when I play

So, uh.Do dinosaurs honk?(Much love to the staff, the runners, the commentators, and everyone! Love this event, and always the highlight of my new year. Keep up the awesome moves and great cause!)

Shout out to WolfDNC and the couch. The Baby belongs to my drummer and I have an ear infection, I pray for raptors to eat me. My life, Waifu. My life.
No no no no no no no
Some would say that Monster Hunter is the spiritual successor to Dino Crisis
Just like when a puppy steals your shoe... so you chase it around with a shotgun.
You are cheating
Hek hek hek richmon, love from Johnny 5 Aces
I watch this all the time and my wife made me do this. Good luck to all the runners!
Hello from Brazil... Keep the awesome work guys!!
Dinosaurs? Rex please.Been watching GDQ for years and I can't pass up the chance to donate during a crisis involving dinosaurs.
Oh wow. Resident Evi-- I mean Resident Crisi-- I mean Dino Crisis 2!Make sure to pet the velociraptors!Good luck on the run wolfdmc!
My First GDQ and my first Donation, I use to play a lot of survivals as a child, I have fond memories of playing Dino Crisis 2 in Coop with my cousin, he played as Dylan and me as Regina. now that we are on our thirties, we would love another amazing remake as RE2 and RE3, but with dinos, You can do it Capcom
Do you know how dinosaurs pay their bills in this game? They use Tyrannosaurus cheques.
My friends 2 year old nephew was diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and he loves dinosaurs. This event is truly a blessing. And all the staff that make it happen are making lives better with all their work. Let's all work together to make cancer extinct just like the dinosaurs in dinosaurs crisis 2.
Very considerate of the velociraptors to let you climb ladders without attacking--if only all dinosaurs were so polite. Second year watching GDQ, and I'm very excited to see all the cool games and their awesome runners. Dino hype!
Hey everyone! Have fun at AGDQ! Good luck on the run, Wolf!
These dinos don't seem to have a chance. Hopefully neither does cancer.
Have you heard of the place called G D Q,out in the land of red, white & blue?Year after year I keep going back,to abandon all duties, to lose all track.It's much too speedy, too quick, too fast!Open my eyes, a week has passed!I sit on my bed, stare at the floor,well that's never happened before!(That's a lie though, it's happened f o u r t e e n times for me already, ever since AGDQ 2013! Cheers from Finland!)
Good luck with the Dino run, WolfDNC. Beware of those grabby Bois.
I said I would donate as soon as I got home and I meant it, here's to the first of hopefully many donations this agdq
Wolf, when are we training again?
I have fond memories of gunning down those plesiosaurs, can't believe that was 20 years ago. Shout outs to my brother Miguel who I used to play this game with as a kid, and to my dad who is winning his own battle with cancer.
Dino crisis? You could solve that with a bit of dinoMITE
How can I not donate during one of my all time favorite series!?!? Dinosaurs and ANOTHER Third Energy disaster? DC Remake when Capcom?!?!?! Good luck to WolfDNC!!
I lost both my mum and my nan this year, my mum having gotten me into video games since before I can remember. I couldn't not donate during Dino Crisis, as when I was little I would constantly beg my mum to give me a go but never leave the first room for fear of the raptors, but even when mum took the controller again I would run out the room before I saw anything else. Keep up the great work!
What do you call a terrible, horrible, unpleasant dinosaur? A thesaurus!
If we're being honest here: I dinosaur is actually just a bigger, slightly less threatening goose. HONK!
loving the event, keep up the great runs. Hype? Orb? Honk!?
Yo but is that WolfDNC tho?!
Came home from job ,saw twitch tv trening dino crisis 2 ,in so proud that you guys run this game ,First played it in 2002 when i was 6 ,me and my dad loved this game ,seeing you play brought me to tears ! Huge shout to the couch !!!! Good luck with the run!!!
Been watching for years. 1st time donating! Shout out to WOLF and this dope DC2 run! Will Capcom give us the DC 1 Remake in 2020? Or maybe DC1&2!!!? Ohh and Save Brad Dourif!
Wish I was there in person, maybe next time. Good luck Wolf, you're making this game look easy! Let's beat cancer!
WAIT! Shoot AND run? *Facepalm*
HONK!
I helped create Def-con, please don't read this.
Can't start a 3.50 train for the Loch Ness monster so how about 5 dollars?
I just found out about GDQ last year but I have been binging old events and runs. I love the skill involved and the great work done for charity. My mum died of cancer 5 years back and I can't think of a better reason to donate than preventing cancer. Loving the run as it's the closest we'll ever get to a Jurassic Park game. Good luck with the run and remember, T-rex's can't see you if you don't move. Also, HONK
I wanted to send in a pun but I dino I can't think of one.
Have y'all played Dino Existential Crisis? It's good! You have to keep a middle aged dinosaur from having a heart attack whole he reads a newspaper article about a meteor that Dino scientists think it's probably not a that...
Don't Raptor's have feathers? Honk!
Great to see one of my Favorite child hood games being bested so quick! Lets hope we get that remake Capcom knows we all want! Have a great rest of your stream! I'll be cheering from home!
Please no Aquacure... oh wait, wrong game! Good luck with the dinos!
I've been watching GDQ for years now and am finally donating. Here's to leaving Saavedro to die.
VERY DANGER! :O
This is in response to the derogatory comments about a Thesaurus. Thesauri are great! Best of luck to the runners, and the Prevent Cancer Foundation. I have terminal cancer myself and I hope this donation helps to save someone else in the future. Live like there's no tomorrow!
Happy GDQ!!
Fo'daaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayz (Really draw it out)
This is my favorite Jurassic Park game.
Bye Todd.
I just wanted to let my best friend know that Brown is chewing
Four years into my vertebrate paleontology degree and here to tell you that birds are the last living dinosaurs, which means technically, Untitled Goose Game is a spiritual sequel to Dino Crisis. Thanks for doing what you do, save the animals, and... save a few dinosaurs for me to study, please!!
What do you say to the cancer when it wants you to DIE? NO SAURRY (dinosaur)
First donation this event, doubt it will be the last. Lets tyrannosaurus reck cancer.
Good luck my dude.
Go to bed son. eat your vegetables
I don't know anything about this game and am new to watching speed runs in general, but I love what GDQ does. Cancer has affected my family over and over, and it warms my heart to see people donating to this cause. Wish I could donate more, but sadly, this is all I can do for now. Good luck to all the runners during AGDQ!
do you also accept dinosaur jokes? what sound does one hand clapping make? - ask from t-rexalso: clap once if you liked it
Alright you didn't get the tank fight, but I'll give you the 50 for that Gigantosaurus 1 fight.Think you can do it again Wolf? Nother 50 with your name on it.
Dino puns? What do you call dinner on an airplane? Fly and dine. No, soar and dine.
Excited to see a Myst block at AGDQ! Failing the end puzzle and having Saavedro leave you isn't an option, so I guess I'll put this money towards saving Saavedro.
Loving this Dino Crisis run!Jurassic HONK!
Thanks for all the hard work for a great cause. Shout out to the late night crew!
Absolutely love Dino Crisis and what GDQ stands for. Keep up the amazing work, everyone involved. Honk.
THE SELF-DESTRUCT SEQUENCE HAS BEEN ACTIVATED. ALL PERSONNEL EVACUATE IMMEDIATELY.
I am a thousand winds that blow,I am the yellow raptors who are so slow,Do not stand at my grave and cry,I am not there. I did not die.
Huge fan of the Myst series and excited for the Myst block, even if the games aren't typical speedrun material. Donating to save Saavedro, because Brad Dourif deserves to share in the best ending.
Is Atrus the worst video game dad ever? Maybe try spending some time with your kids before eternally imprisoning them in books. Just sayin’...GDQs are my favorite two weeks of the year. Here’s to ten more years of community, philanthropy, and fun. Words don’t capture my admiration for the work y’all do: Honk!!
I would love to say I beat Myst without a walkthrough but needed help when I didn't know I had to STRIKE the match before lighting the furnace. Consider this a protip for the run. HONK!!!
Huge fan of both point-and-clicks and GDQ, hyped to catch these runs in person for the first time. Greetings from the audience.
Stayed up passed my bedtime just to witness the Myst trilogy. Donating toward letting poor Saavedro go home to his family after all these years.
As Gehn might say,"I am Gehn. Perhaps you've--hey, where are you going?""The only path open to you now is through this donation. Take it."Wanted to get in a Gehn joke in this block before I *Myst* my opportunity. Have a great run and save the Saavedros! [pronounced: sah-VAY-droh(z)]
Catherine, my love, I have to leave quickly. Something has happened. They've entered the adventures of our quiet friend into Games Done Quick! I must make a donation while I can. Oh, and erase this message after you read it. That goose seems to be following me everywhere, and I don't want it to know where I've gone.
**Please read during the Riven run by Zaustus if possible!** Hype for Gelly, Zaustus, and Admiral Flapjack from Stryk, Narameh, and all of us in the RockPunch discord! Zaustus you've been such a great presence with all of us, and we believe in you! Best of luck to all of you, and donation goes to Zaustus's choice!
this is my first time watch AGDQ live my father has a Intestinal cancer for 3 years now and this year he just begin to do a chemotherapy. I hope my 5$ will be able to help other people that have cancer problems :D
The Myst trilogy was a big part of my childhood. The games are a bit of an odd choice for a speedrun, but I'm excited to see them on the big screen regardless. Don't let those pages fall into the wrong hands (or beaks)!
When I was a kid, my parents were in the ‘video games rot your brain’ camp. Myst was one of the only titles I was allowed to play, so this series will always have a special place in my heart. I’m thrilled to see a favorite getting so much love during one of my favorite weeks of the year. Games Done Quick is one of the things that makes me proud to say that I am a gamer, and I’m so excited for what the next ten years have in store. Hype and honk to all!
Honk
In the last two years, my dog, future mother-in-law, and close co-worker were all diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately they all managed to beat it, thanks in no small part to organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation who are working to bring an end to such a horrible disease. Plus, I HAD to donate during the Myst block - without a doubt the best game TRILOGY of all time. Thanks to all the runners and volunteers for putting on another wonderful event!
Stayed up late to watch Myst block with my Mom, have to donate for it. Can we get a hype 'Honk' from the audience?
How cool is it that we're seeing classic graphic adventures at a GDQ?! It calls to mind SGDQ2012, when Mr. K did his epic run of SimCity.Yes, I know how that sounds!
LETS GO
Never thought I'd see the Myst series at GDQ. Great event, great cause, and it's up to all of us to make sure that, as far as GDQ is concerned, the ending has not yet been written.
Saavedro? More like SAVEdro, amirite?
Grew up playing the Myst games, Exile even being my favorite, so I had to donate for this block
Bring me green pages....I mean donate green dollars!
What do I put here. I guess.... HONK?
Ah, my friend! You've returned – we meet face-to-face. And the page, did you bring the page? … [Sighs] You didn't bring the page. You didn't bring the page! What kind of fool are you?
Thanks for the hours of entertainment. Let's kick cancer's butt!
To try and end the horror of cancer, from a survivor
Last time I saw this much myst I was in the sauna you know what I'm sayin'?Pour one out for the killed animals. Biblethump FrankerZ
Myst was the first "big kid" video game I finished all by myself and is still one my favorite games to this day. I'm absolutely delighted to see not just it but a whole Myst block at AGDQ!
<Atrus_voice>I realized the moment I clicked the "submit" button, that my donation would not buy me a pizza as I'd (originally) planned. It continued traveling across that digital expanse, for an event at which I had only a fleeting glimpse.I've tried to pontificate on where my donation ended up - I must admit, however, that preventing cancer is worthwhile. Still, rumors about how fast these runners can go, are kinda exciting to me.I know the friendly animals might never be saved, and so I close - realizing that, perhaps, last year's record might yet be broken.</Atrus_voice>
Just got back from work, what did I Myst?
first game i ever played was The Secret of Monkey Island, but i have a hell of a soft spot for Myst as well.
LOVED WATCHING DINOS GETTING PUT TO SLEEP, SLEEP SLUGS FOR THE WIN. HONK.
Shoutout to the late-night crowd!
Long time watcher, first time donator. The first game series I ever played was the Myst series. I spent HOURS going through all the CDs for Riven. I'm so excited to see these games played at AGDQ this year. This cause means a lot to me as my aunt passed away from Breast Cancer. Thank you to all the runners and volunteers.
A SEABIRD CALLS.THE UNKNOWING ONE STANDS AT THE RAIL.PEACE. THE CIRCLE CLOSED.THE LAST WORD WRITTEN.
Just here for the N64
I played my first point and click - Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis - before I could even read. I guess it was a challenge run? I've been hooked on them ever since. Excited for the Myst runs.
I had to donate during the Myst block. It was my first point and click and will always have the softest spot in my heart. Props to the runners. Money goes to reuniting Saavedro with his family!
Had to sneak a donation in here for my Dad and all the hours we spent playing Myst and Riven together when I was a kid.
Myst has a real special place in my heart, I was a bit young when they came out but my mom played them and I would sit next to her or in her lap and help by taking "notes." Good luck to the runners!
Thank you for the wonderful event. Greedings from Germany
I have loved the Myst series since I was a little boy and Riven has consistently been a game I've gone back to because of it's amazing world and music and mystery. can't wait to see these games speed ran. thanks for all you do gdq. hi Ingrid
Donating for the Myst runs, I still remember playing Myst as a kid and it blowing me away as something completely different than what I'd seen in games before, even if I didn't beat it until many years later, it still left a big impact.
Loooooooove Myst! Can’t wait to see a game that took what felt 30 years to beat get obliterated! Go AGDQ! Can’t wait to break more records!
Stayed up to donate during the Myst runs. The puzzles in Myst stumped me back in the day, but growing up I still loved the adventure game genre. Shout out especially to the Monkey Island, Sam and Max, and Gabriel Knight games! HONK!
First time GDQ viewer here! As an avid fan of videogames my whole life, I'd always been aware of speedrunning, but never knew until about a year ago truly what an awesome community there was. Ever since then, I've been captivated by the amount of skill, practice, and research that goes into these runs. For my first donation, it had to be during the Myst block, some of my favorite games of all time! Thanks to everyone involved for doing great things for a great cause. MYST HONK!! I mean, MYST HYPE!!
I watched my dad play these myst games years ago when i got to frustrated with the puzzles to do it myself. definitely a fond childhood memory and i can't wait to see these awesome games done quick. keep up the good work and shout out to the late night crowd keeping up the hype.
Hi from the second row!! I've got work on the other side of the state tomorrow, but these are my absolute favourite games. I couldn't miss these, even if I end up asleep at work tomorrow!
What a blast from the past. Shout out to Kalmineus. so sorry you MYST this GDQ <3
So many great runs already and it's only the first day, but I had to donate for Myst block! It can't be missed!
Hype for the hat that dances.
Shoutout to my fellow Night Workers, passing the time during long shifts the best way we can - with speedruns and charity donations! Looking forwards to this Myst trilogy!
Speaking of Lucasarts point and click games. You have to mention "The Dig". Keep up the good work y'all.
Shoutouts to Gehn. Also, are the golden domes in Riven domes... or are they orbs...?
Myst was one of the first games I ever played. I'm super excited to see the game that took 7 year old me weeks done is 15 minutes.
Just finished my first play through of realMyst today, can’t wait to see you totally destroy it!
Fight cancer!
Excited for this Myst block. Grew up on on point and clicks in the 90s. Shout out to The 7th Guest. Honk.
I never thought I would see a myst game played at GDQ, so it is incredible to see three of them being ran here today. The whole myst series has a special place in my heart, and im so happy to see them being ran today.
Been lurking for years while in grad school. Finally have a professor job and enough income to donate. Love GDQ so much.
Myst is one of the first computer games I ever played with my brother, I could never get through the puzzles by myself, but he always helped me through them. Can't believe it's been 10 years. Thank you for what you do!
I enjoyed Myst (games and books) but loved 7th Guest and 11th Hour!
I literally gave a presentation in college on the importance of Myst in video game and PC hardware history. Excited to watch a whole block of Myst games get the love and attention they deserve.
So glad to have you while I can't sleep :) Keep up the good work <3
It's amazing to hear that the Myst games are showing up at AGDQ! But, man, save Saavedro. No one left picking up the pieces after Sirrus and Achenar's library rampage should have that last shred of hope torn from them. Although, be sure to bring Achenar all the blue pages. He seems an all right dude, right?
Myst was one of the first PC games I ever played, and I've been in love with the series for 25 years. Super pumped to see a Myst block this year. Thanks to all of the runners, staff, and volunteers for everything you do. Cancer has directly impacted my family multiple times over the past few years, and it's encouraging to see so much going towards fighting this horrible disease. Save the Saavedros!
Love y'all down at GDQ, keep it up and am excited for this year! It's gonna be honking great!
Staying up late for Myst...
AGDQ is the best thing to watch on a Monday morning after not much sleep. You make my morning a lot less horrible! Especially with the Myst games. Love these since I'm a kid!
PowerPoint, er... I mean MYST block!? What the honk!?
So glad to see the first game I ever got obsessed with on the AGDQ stage. And shout out to the kid in second grade who told me about page 158.
Myst has a special place in my heart, such amazing memories playing it with my mom, as well as reading the 3 books that tell the backstory. Super excited to see what a speedrun looks like!And cheers to one of my top 3 favorite hosts - The dulcet tones of Prolix!
big hype for the Myst block, played with my dad as a kid. always makes me feel good. =]
Saavedro cannot be trusted
Oh gamers! Don't you dare be peeved! Clap for your favorite runners and feel the speed! It's Games Done Quick, yes it is!
I thought GDQ was about killing the animals? Saavedro's gotta die.
BRING ME THE RED PAGES
I first watched my brother play all of the #MYSTseries and have always been intrigued by the story. Good luck on the speedruns guys!
Love gdq! Let's beat cancer! Hype!
I only recently got into the Myst games last year and I have been loving them ever since. Well except for maybe Myst V, but we don't talk about that one...
Good luck on the run, win for Robin who is sick in bed watching!
Cure Cancer!
Gotta save Saavedro. Gotta make this decade about being the good guy.
Welp, it's January 6th now, and that means I just turned 40. And I'm staying up past my bedtime to feel old watching Myst speedruns while dreaming HyperCard dreams. Here's one dollar for each year to my name. Congrats on a great first day, and here's to an awesome week.
Happy New & Happy AGDQThank you GDQ for these incredible events and big up to LFR for their jobBonne année et joyeux AGDQMerci GDQ pour ces moments formidables et une ovation pour le boulot du LFR#GDQup
The Myst series is my favorite video game of all time! Gotta admit I don't like Saavedro. He almost killed Atrus and Catherine!
Saavedro is not to blame for his actions, he is victim of past atrocity. Do what is right and rectify the past!
This game is a...Myst play
Seeing all these Myst games being ran is gonna make me all Mysty eyed.
Realmyst, riven, myst 3, arbor mist, Sierra mist. Hype!!
Is it me or is it misty in here? Shoutout to everyone in the Board Game Room! Much love <3
Hello there from Hungary! Today is my birthday and watching AGDQ live is the best birthday gift ever! Sending out love to everyone out there! HYPE!
Go Gelly! Best of luck Walma7Love
First time watcher and I'm enjoying the excellent content
Please let me out of this book.Also hello to my husband who is in the crowd RIGHT NOW, I hope you're having an awesome time!
So excited for Myst block.... I have beaten all three games being run. Myst III was the easiest, and also the longest, because I didn't have the resolution to see the solution for the FINAL PUZZLE!!!! I finally looked up the answer one year later after not being able to figure it out!
Donating to Leave Saavedro. He's seems to shifty to save
Can't wait for these next three runs, I wouldn't Myst them for the world! It sounds like the runners are really dRiven to go as fast as they can... Its Exile-rating!
Looking forward to the Myst block. These are some of my favorite games and I am happy to see them at AGDQ. Save Saavedro. He has been through a lot and he deserves a break.
HONK!! Myst and Riven were some of the first games I played, and I found them hella confusing and didn't really know what I was doing. Looking forward to seeing them speed run, and still being confused about what's going on!
Your noclip is augmented, nice run.
How could I Myst my favorite game as a child. Here's hype for the Myst block.
Donating for that adorable Bomber Man plush. Thanks so much for the prevent cancer foundation, mother was able to take care of early onset skin cancer on her face and after 5 months she's made a full recovery! Always enjoy watching these events and brings back memories of when I actually had time to play video games!
I'm glad to see my favourite game series here :)Good luck to Gelly.
Wooooooooosh
I love the idea of taking a genre meant to be thoughtful, time-consuming, unhurried and speedrunning it! Also, who can say no to Brad Dourif?
My girlfriend and I played this game together to test the strength of our relationship. I'm now single.
Love Myst, but I can't watch the Riven or Exile runs because I haven't finished them yet! Good luck to the runners.
Sure, it's late at night, but I couldn't Myst this run! Good luck runners!
I haven't played this game for years, I've really myst it
What, is the run over already? I can't believe I mist that.
The first time you play this game is a bit *Myst-ifying*. ba dum tss. >:D♥
Knock knock. Whose there? Myst. Myst who? Aww, I missed you too AGDQ!
It's cool to see Gelly really BOOK IT through this game.
wait.... is this not the silent hill block? because it seems awfully MYSTy in here right now
Not a Myst joke but it still a good one.Frankenstein enters a bodybuilding competition and finds he has seriously misunderstood the objective.
Shorah all! I’ve CHOsen to donate aGEHN during my favorite video game of all time, Riven, so here's five fives. If you’ve ever wondered what an educational game for cultural anthropologists would look like, well, here it is. I think it is a real MYSTerpiece!The Prevent Cancer Foundation D’needs our generosity, and with your help perhaps the ending will not be written for the lives of many strangers. Let’s LINK together to EXILE cancer!Good luck Zaustus! Here’s hoping the game WAHRKS until the end. It’s not exactly... ATRUS-ty speedrun.
here is my pinball money for this weekend as i forgot about agdq.... sadly
Donating for the pin set
Atrus, I'm trying to solve these puzzlesbut I'm D'ni thickand the flapping of my pages keeps alerting Ghen!Good luck from the Court of Hearts, Zaustus!
Hey Brossentia!Okay, I know Brossentia isn't up right now, but still...I tried to catch fog, but I...Myst!
Happy Birthday Jason! So glad we were able to come experience our first GDQ together. We’ve “myst” you!
hot take: the best modern Myst game is Outer Wilds
Y'ALL RIVEN FOR MYST?
Simply aMazed by that Myst run! Shout out to seeing more of these point and clicks at gdq in the future!
Saavedro did nothing wrong. Well, mostly nothing.
Shoutout to my childhood friend, [insert goose here], who would come over to my house with Myst III Exile to watch me play the game on my computer for hours. I'm sure he was bored every minute. Thanks, bro.
Been enjoying the day watching these great games. My poor wife is suffering from the flu so she's watching herself. Shout out a get well soon cristen from Prolix?
(if read on air, alias is pronounced "Zen - fear - uh"). My boyfriend and I had such a wonderful time playing Myst together, it's great to see these guys on GDQ playing it real quick! He's asleep, so I guess I'll have to tell him in the morning that he "Myst" the speedrun!
Shorah, GDQ! Riven is the best game ever made. Excited to see the Myst series at this event! Save Saavedro...for the whark gallows!
MYST PUN TIME: I used to be a Maker like Atrus, but then I took an arrow in D'ni.
If Myst was that good, this run should be Riven-ting!
Myst was so formative for me I am absolutely delighted to see it on AGDQ! Though watching someone beat a game in 45 seconds that took me a over year is a little crushing.Anyways Shorah everyone, and shoutout to my my Myst-y friends Lynne and E4. Don't forget: The doors linking books open don't close behind you.
So glad to see the Myst games at AGDQ! Shout out to Kalmenius, good luck to the runners, and don’t forget to lock that door!
It would be a Myst-ake to Myst the Myst block. The Myst-ery of the fate of Saavedro will keep me awake, but something is Amyst in this world. I'm no Myst-er know-it-all but I know this Myst Marathon needs more puns.
First time attending, and staying up way too late to watch the Myst trilogy. Shoutouts to the Scorbunny hat up front.
Had I missed MYST, I would have been quite miffed.
Love y'all! <3
Loving the block! Realhonk: Mastergeese Edition, Ribbon: Sequel to Honk, and Honk 3: Eggs Isle were some of my favorites as a wee little gosling.
Mysty-eyed shoutout to my dear friends The Leaf Squad! Excited to have one of my favorite games hosted my one of my favorite GDQ voices. Hi Prolix! Gimme your best HONK for $25 more!
I always look forward to AGDQ to kickoff the year--congrats on 10 years and here's to a decade more! Save the frames and let's kill that cancer.
I used to play Riven as a wee nipper, and have good memories; even had a friend who play tested for Cyan, so here's another 25 for the memories.HONK!
hope the riven dome combo is "1 2 3 4 5"
Riven! Oh how I *MYST* this game!The puzzles never *CLICKED* with me when I was a kid...I wish I could have *BOOKED* a seat at AGDQ for this!Time for a *RIVE(N)-ting* adventure~!I was going to give these puns as anonymous, but I didn't want to be too *MYST-erious*!I'll be back with more~!
Honk!
Please read mine, please read mine, please read mine (just in cause you read mine, yay!!) HONK!!!!
I missed dino crisis, I am crazy mad. I'm going to donate anyway for my favourite game!
Myst was one of my first games. Great to see it at GDQ. Excited to watch yet another great week of speedrunning. Good luck runners!
**PLEASE READ DURING MYST III**I've known you for years, introduced you to your wife, I've even been in your house and cooked you dinner, and this is how you repay me? By being an amazing speedrunner AND raising money for a charity that means a whole lot to me personally? How so very dare you!Congrats on making it to AGDQ, Flapjack, Proud of you, my boy! Donation goes to runner's choice, as long as it's cool.Also, I never do this anymore so I gotta do it now - FLAPJACK SENPAI HYPE!
I love the Myst series, one day I might actually finish one of them... good luck on the runs everyone!
Great memories with the Myst block. Loved how the games fit with the books. Thanks GDQ for the good times.
Can you ask the runner to play a game and not a slideshow? I just myst what he just did.
I grew up watching my mum play Myst and fell in love with the series. If you pay attention to the law it’s really just an story of a bad father and misbehaving kids. Money goes to saving Saavedro despite the nightmares he gave me as a kid.
GDQ, prevent cancer foundation, chance for golden eye prize... how can I not throw my name in the hat.
Knock knock.Who's there?Myst.Myst who?Mystical Goose. HONK!!
I'm sad I couldn't watch the Skyward Sword run because of timezones, but at least I'm awake for the Myst games. And I'll get to catch up on the runs with the VoDs once the week is over. Thanks fr
Grew up with Myst, with Exile being one of my all time favorite games. Looking forward to seeing it crushed! Best luck to this block’s runners!
Hey, Zaustus -- I think you might have Myst a book or two. (Donation goes to runner's choice.)
Zaustus seems to really CLICK with this game. Let me know if you MYST that pun....HONK!
This is my first time donating at a GDQ. I had to donate since my Mother have had cancer and both grandmothers died to cancer.
Saavedro did everything wrong but honestly my bad
Of course we have to save Saavedro. Save is right there in his name, assuming you spell save with two A's!
Congrats on your first run at GDQ, Flapjack Senpai! From your wife and everyone else in TDS: We're so proud of you!
So much fun to see speedruns of the Myst games I played as a kid
Here's a small chunk to help. Been watching with my bro since 2016 and we've always donated. Glad this year to be able to do more. Thank you all for what you do. Rock on and from Canada HYPE
Rinda rinda
Thanks to the runners and GDQ for the awesome event and thanks to Cyan for making the most gorgeous puzzle games!
TYSM for reading this MYST donation
I am a Myst fan since my father played it in my childhood. I spent so many hours in URU... Good old times...
Loving all the Genesis/Mega Drive music! FM synth so crunchy and goooooood
Omg I love being here at aqgt 2020
We love Rinda, she must succeed!
Rinda Rinda Rindaaaaa
First time donation here, shout outs to all the runners here coming together for such a great cause! Stay fresh out there!
Hello GDQ and Flappy! So great to see all the runs again! Good luck to all the runners! Donation to Flappy's choice!
It's always a honor to host speedruns at the Internet Archive, and shout out to Chris Hanel and his marathon "quality control" checking
Excited to be watching AGDQ live for the first time! This is for my best friend Mat watching at home.
Hopefully you won't Voltaic the easy way out and decide to Releeshan Saveedro. Everyone knows that's the Real Best ending so to not do so would be a Myst opportunity!
So proud of seeing Admiral Flapjack do a speedrun of Myst III: Exile. Everyone at Team Dysfunctional Shenanigans is proud! Also so excited that the developers of Myst showed such support for these three speed runners to be at ADGQ 2020. P.S. Leave Saavedro, he seems suspect.
This is my first time donating and I wanted to say thank you for putting on such a great event.
Oh boy, if I was in that cage, I would have destroyed the dude singing opera. Also, shout out to the person in the hat with the flappable ears
It would be Myst-ical to have Rand and Robyn on the couch next year.
Hey Gelly and Admiral Flapjack! This is for the Return of the Obra Dinn community. It's awesome to see you guys on AGDQ running the Untitled Windows 3.1 Myst-ery game series. Wait, is that why it's called Myst?... Incentive is Flapjack's choice!
Greetings from Aersia! Cancer will not be Myst!
My eyes are getting myst-y from the end of this mini marathon!
Late? My day is just getting started. We will be doing the nightshift ;) greetings from europe
I'd be reMyst (remiss) not to donate during the Myst block. Here's to more terrible puns!
You don't like Myst puns? Boo hoo, cry me a riven.
I hope the community isn't Riven apart by all these puns, and that no one gets sent into Exile for them; they would be sorely Myst if they were.
Had to leave a donation for one of my favorite games from N64! Haven't seen Bomberman Hero speedran before, so looking forward to it! Let's push for $150k!
BRING ON THE REDIAL!
Just finished some Winter Break grading. Going back to school in 4 hours. Can you tell my son Willem that He needs to go to bed.
boo cancer
First time live viewer but long time fan! Let's beat back cancer together while enjoying some awesome speedruns!
Saving the midnight crew from boredom, thanks again GDQ!

Hey guys Zeno here, going on my 4th GDQ and felt the need to donate some of the Christmas funds. Here's hoping it goes to a good cause and we all tell Cancer to get bent.Put my money towards HONK GANG. HONK NEVER CHANGES.
20 years later and the Bomberman Hero OST STILL slaps!!
Thanks for hosting and here’s to the rest of what is shaping up to be yet another amazing GDQ!
AGDQ had gotten off with an explosive start and have enjoyed the runs so far, but Myst my chance to donate during the last block. Excited to see Liquid Squid play Hero as it is one of my favorite games in the series because the soundtrack is the bomb. Can't wait to see the rest of the runs this week as they should be a blast to watch.
Hello AGDQ, hello Squid....Hello Patrick. Here's to good music.
Big shoutout to my boy squid, proud of you for hitting the big time.
Hi Patty, this is Anonymous with no comment. I'm glad me and my wife get to spend a few hours with you and your sultry voice

I lost a good friend to cancer in 2019. Therefore I am happy to support GDQ. Here is the first to get my donation marathon started.... Greetings from Germany.
Bomberman Hero is an all time favorite n64 game and holds many memories for me and my brother.
Bomberman Hero is the most realistic game in the series.
Played this game a lot back in the day when you had to rent games from blockbuster. This game has great memorable music :)
I stayed up late for one of my favorite N64 games, I remember playing it on Sunday mornings. Also, Yatta!
Been watching for gdq for ages but have never donated so seemed like it was past due! thanks so much to all the runners and everyone involved for all you do!
First time coming to a GDQ, coming all the way Australia. Just woke up in order to watch this live. Love this game. Go Liquid Squid!
Bomberman Hero was the first video game my siblings and I owned. Lots of fun memories playing to this banging soundtrack! We're having a blast staying up late with everyone :) Cheers!
Been enjoying the audience "yatta" so much for this awesome Bomberman run that I thought I should inform everyone that "honk" in Japanese would be "gaa".
First time donating, shout outs to all the runners and the amazing ways they break our favorite games! Stay fresh out there, runners!
Long time watcher of GDQ's in general, wanted to finally get a donation in now that I can afford to set some money aside for AGDQ and SGDQ each year. Shout out to my brother James who is watching at home as well. I'll toss in another $25 if this gets read!
Hey squid you ever notice how those different colored slime enemies look like puyos?
Love y'all! >3Heck... love you >5
My boy squid on the big time, what a guy! Where the beers at?
This is one of those N64 games I never got around to but I'm really enjoying the run and the great commentary by the @KirkQ.
YATTA ^_^
So progressive
Hello from Tokyo!
Hello to all my speedfriends! The music in this game rips, and I get to listen to it for a good cause! Stay comfy.
First time donating, long time watcher! My brothers and I have been watching and reminiscing Bomberman!
YATTA
Bien le bonjour de la Suisse, un premier petit don pour s’échauffer.Vous faites du super travail LeFrenchRestream, bravo !#Subnautica
Always love hearing Patty on the mic late at night. This rocking soundtrack doesn't hurt, either.
Woke up just in time to listen to Patty and his amazing voice, first year watching first time donating, and happy to for such a great cause, keep up all the good work! Yatta!
Watching Games Done Quick is always a blast! I love seeing the booming success this has become with such explosive results. I sure hope these jokes don’t bomb. Keep up the great work everyone!
Good luck on the run Squid! I love this game, my sisters and I would always rent it on weekends. This music is seriously taking me back.Always love supporting GDQ and looking forward to another 10 years.
Bomberman is the life of the party: He always blows up the piñYATTA!
YATTA!
Bomberman Hero is the best snowboarding game on the N64. BOMBER CHANGE!
Happy to leave a donation during Bomberman Hero, such a charming game with an absolutely amazing soundtrack!

Donating for Jun Chikuma's good good music~
Patty, it's great to hear your sensual tones reading the donations. Looking forward to this n64 block and more. Put this donation towards your choice, mister fours.
Thought that Bomberman cart Blew a Fuse for a moment there. I love watching this event with my treasured pal every year. Hi Roxanne! I've had a rough time lately but this cozy Bomberman Hero run is healing me a bit, so I thought I'd contribute to a great cause. We stan Jun Chikuma, V, and [redacted].
Pumped to see Bomberman right before I head to bed. Props to Squid for sticking to the grind, and shoutouts to everyone on the second couch and those sweet, sweet Ape Escape hats.
Cheers Squid. Good luck on the runs.
I turn back on AGDQ and I see Bomberman Hero being run? Fantastic, one of the best N64 games I ever played growing up as a kid! Keep up the amazing work on the run so far Liquid Squid & all the best with the rest of the week to all the AGDQ staff. #IDidIt
Will keep donating $5 if Patty keeps singing! Let the serenading dulcet tones begin

ProgramMax donates 50 smacker-oonies
When I heard the GDQ schedule was out, I searched the list for two things: video games I like and when Patty would be commentating. I'm glad I did, because I'm not sure if I would have stayed up tonight, and this run is really cool. Id say hi ho you, but someone already made you say hi to yourself, so so I'm going to say hi to myself instead. Hi Luke.
Hey Pat, will we be able to see you on the couch like last year, on the Link to the Past + Super Metroid Combo Randomizer run? I remember laughing so hard through the whole run. goooood times <3 greatings and love from germany.
And don't forget the joker
Donating for two of my favorite streamers. Squid and Patrick "PCULL44444" Patty. Never played this game as a kid, but I played Bomberman 64. So I guess that's cool.
As promised, here is the follow up $25. Big thank you to everyone who puts together these wonderful events every year. Put this second $25 towards runner's choice. Also, you got my name right on the second try, congrats XD
Awesome job to Liquid Squid! We loved playing Bomberman Hero back in the day. Such a fun game with an amazing soundtrack! Always look forward to AGDQ every year, can we get a “I did it!”?
Gotta donate for these banger bomberman tracks!
Really enjoying this run! Missed out on this game growing up and wanted to donate during this awesome run! Also Yatta > Honk
Hello from the audience squid can you please give us your best banjo impression
Donating $25 just to hear you say "smackaroonies", again.
The soundtrack for Bomberman Hero slaps. Shoutouts to all my Free Company friends on Final Fantasy XIV watching.
Loving the late night Patty, let's hit $150K by the end of Bomberman Hero!
Boom
Never played Bomberman before, but seeing new games is part of the fun of watching GDQ for me! Thanks for the run, Squid, and thanks as well to the lovably sassy Patty for hopefully reading this donation!
ONIOOOOLove you Squid
I was going to go to bed, but now I need to stay up for one of my favorite Nintendo 64 games. Yatta!
This donation is in memory of my former coworker Darnell Chipwich (this was actually his name) who lost his battle with cancer 5 years ago. He was a dear friend and he will be missed.

Shoutouts to Bomberman for having the best soundtracks on the N64.
Shout out to the siren people behind the couch
Hey as someone who sold their OG copy of Bomberman to pay off rent when I got laid off, I am SO happy to see someone playing it. I've missed the game, and selling that game made me so sad. but so happy to see it played again, and had to drop a sub and follow to support.
First time watching live, first time donating. Best of luck to all runners, and to blowing cancer away.
Hello Patty. It is time to break banks again.
Just here to make Patty say smackaroonies again.
 (Comment rejected)
Huge Bomberman fan here! Gotta show some love for featuring it on AGDQ
Finally off work and now I can watch the runs uninterrupted. Is anyone awake? Lets get some early morning HYPE!!!!!!...
My parents had an n64 for about a week before returning it and crushing my dreams of playing those classics at an early age There was one game that's been eating my up for far longer than it should have and all I remember is that they were shooting at a purple sphere together. Thank you AGDQ for finally solving the 20+ year mystery of Tetrisphere for me and I can't wait to see the run later today.
Bomberman is so cute! And this run and commentary is excellent 3am entertainment. Thanks for the great work!
I did it! But then they changed what *it* was. Now I have no idea what *it* is.
Look forward to GDQ every year! So happy to see Bomberman Hero being ran. Enjoying staying up and watching Liquid Squid dominate the run!
Here's a $5 donation from anonymous. And we are just $5000 away from hitting $150000. This is the greatest commenter asking you all to donate and help us hit that goal. I'm not reading their comment anymore, just wanted to remind everyone how great of a person I am.
G! R! DOUBLE E! N! LEAVES! YATTA!!
:Pattysquint:
All I can manage at the moment, but it’s for a good cause. The runners and announcers are all awesome Kupo! Keep doing what you’re doing Kupo!
I always make a point to donate every year for my best friend who lost his fight with cancer at 25. Never forget to tell loved ones how much they mean to you. Keep up the good work AGDQ.Oh and uh... Yatta?

Good Luck Necrocoptor! May RNG bless you with the gift of speed!
Let's start this 5$ train to get to 150k. YATTA!
I know he doesn't look like one, but Bomberman is a boomer.
I'll donate another $20 if Squid says "Trans Rights"
do it for patty
This run is very Poggers, cant wait to see more epic bomberman runs
I just have to donate on the 10th anniversary of AGDQ! And I know exactly what I'm donating to. I've always loved the Sonic 06 speedruns for showing how a trainwreck can be broken further. Hopefully Silver's playthrough will be OF USE!!! to dealing with cancer! Thanks so much for weeks of entertainment!
Great runs, amazing event. Thank you to everyone who makes it happen
CHOOCHOO KACHOO
Greetings from austria. What an amazing event each year. Saw the awesome isaac run before but couldn't donate while watching. Good luck to all runners and Edmund McMillen let us have a Repantance run SGDQ 2020 (fingers crossed).
Please tell me how the back couch acquired those Pipo Helmets, I must know
Had to donate for the explosive soundtrack and amazing gameplay. I've enjoyed GDQs for 5 years and hoping to enjoy them for many more.
Had to donate while my favorite snarky streamer, Patty, was hosting! Have a great week everyone! Save the frames!
Play games, beat cancer.
Glad I could donate again to one of my favorite events of the year! Best of luck to all the runners!
Giving up my morning coffee ahead of time just in case I forget! I’m doing it and you should too. Much love from New York!
Staying up late to support my bro. Praying to the RNG gods for a good final boss RNG.
Oh hey Yooka-Laylee 64 looks great!
Donating in hopes that Patty will read donations in his King Kai voice for a while.
 (Comment rejected)
For a friend.
Chameleon Twist 2 is the most important 3D platformer I haven't played.
Let's get to $150k! Also, thanks to everyone behind the scenes and good luck to the runners.
Glad to see Chameleon Twist being run! This was one of the first video games I ever owned, for some reason. I've always been disappointed the series didn't continue on from here...
YOOOO is that Necrocopter??? Hey peter
Donated last SGDQ for the Flappy hat in the audience and I'll do it again!Good luck to the runner.
$150,000 HYPE!
I am not animal expert but this character does not look like chameleon at all....
Had to donate during one of my favorite forgotten N64 platformers, especially since I get to see them with their cute, spherical heads instead of the more accurate, but less cute reptilian heads they have in the US version of the game. Also gotta shout out my boy Patty - Glad I got to catch your time on the mic this year!
This sound track is very good
More Patty voice, and more @nausicaa33 flappy ear hat. Best parts of GDQ. Yes Patty, no cancer.
You know with all the game rereleases that are popping up I wouldn't mind seeing this series showing up again. What's Sunsoft doing these days anywho?
I already donated for it, but I just can't get enough of Silver's whiny voice. Let's see a trainwreck get broken even further! All in for Sonic 06!
Rented both Chameleon Twist games as a kid, and despite how bizarre and janky they are, they still hold a warm place in my childhood. Thanks for playing it at GDQ!
I Rember playing this game as a kid but never beat it. So BEAT IT SUPER FAST also thank you for stopping caner.
the most wonderful time of the year, despite the number of skips involved, it's still a whole week
Hey everyone, donating from the future. It's the final day of GDQ and we're less than 25 bucks from breaking the record, figured I'd use time travel to make it so my donation is the one that puts us over. If Patty reads this it is canon.
Having some 2 am nostalgia watching this Chameleon Twist 2 run. Thanks for playing this gem from my childhood, and best of luck to the runner. Incentive goes to runner's choice.
Go Go Runners! Go Go AGDQ! Go Go PCF!

I do remember Gator Golf! The line from the ad, "You missed! Watch a pro!", remains a part of my family's lexicon to this day.
What could be greater than playing a game of golf with a gator?

It's so late, but you know I gotta stay up for tapioca on a scooter. Good luck with the run, man!
Long-time watcher, first-time donating! My mother was diagnosed with cancer several years ago and thankfully won the battle. Here's hoping nobody else has to go through this. Cheers to everyone!
What could be greater than playing a game of golf with a gator?
Geese are the worst. But whatever, let's see some goose
go tapioca - we love jalapenos!
It's 4 in the morning here, and I've been shotgunning Final Fantasy VI all night. My mom got diagnosed with melanoma last year, but thankfully they caught it so early they were able to excise it before it was an issue. Folks, if you have the opportunity, talk to your doctor! Shouts out to the tech crew for keeping this whole thing together, and big ups to the morning crew in the audience for showing up so early. Get some sleep, folks!
Hi Tapioca! Good luck on the run! Put this towards the runner's choice. Also, can the couch introduce themselves?
Have you honked your Lonk today? GG y’all!
Greetings from Germany,The same procedure like every year, james.This Incentive goes to Announcers Choice.
How do you spell out with a Z?
Thanks to runners! Greetings from Rostov! The chair is flying!
Love AGDQ, saw the cause this year and knew I had to try and catch it live. You're doing amazing work!
I would love to hear Patty telling I donated five "schmeckles"...You all are so amazing!
GET 'EM TAPIOCA
Hey Tapioca! Hyped to see this game make it to GDQ. This game's soundtrack and handclaps are a treasure.
Greetings from the fellas in the Razor Freestyle Scootin' community! Good luck and thanks for all the rad scootin' you've been doing.
Yo here's that money I left here last time (runner's choice)
This escalated quickly.
My head is spinning at how much I'm enjoying this speedrun. I guess you could say it's WHEELY good!...Anyone?

When is the lime remaster coming out? Great run tapioca!
hey patty! $5 from anonymous here wishing you, all the runners, and the attendees a good gdq
tapioca won't say it, so I will: i love you mom
My parents had an n64 for about a week before returning it and crushing my dreams of playing those classics at an early age There was one game that's been eating my up for far longer than it should have and all I remember is that they were shooting at a purple sphere together. Thank you AGDQ for finally solving the 20+ year mystery of Tetrisphere for me and I can't wait to see the run later today.
Even though I have a messed up sleep schedule, I'm loving all the runs of the weird games I played when I was a kid with the impeccable Patty announcing. Good luck everyone on your runs! BTW Patty how are those potato puns
I had a wheel-y good time watching that run - will any other game match the awesomeness of Razor Scooters?Also, shout out to floppy hat lady! Flop those ears!
Hey there AGDQ,greetings from Germany! Best of luck to all the runners and massive shoutouts to everybody awake and kicking at the venue right now. Here's to another awesome week of AGDQ.
Doing a late donation for Binding of Isaac! Does Isaacs head count as an orb?
Tetrisphere hype!
Hey AGDQ, on behalf of the Slime Community we thank for putting on both a great show and fight against Cancer! Shoutout to my wonderful friend Thy :D Good luck to all the runners!
It's my birthday! Being able to watch AGDQ every year is the greatest. Good luck to all the runners! Greetings from Australia.
What up from the front row! I've been watching for years but this my first time attending, and I'm lucky enough to be seeing one of my very favorite games with my very favorite person, my embarrassed girlfriend who's sitting right next to me at this insane hour. Congratulations on ten years and also what I can only assume is a great Tetrisphere run!

My husband Jack introduced me to GDQ when we started dating. We lost someone close to us to cancer nearly a year ago. This is a surprise donation for him. I love you Jack! Enjoy your week off!
Good night from Hawaii!
I got told to donate, so here you go! Us Europeans really appreciate the night crew. Thank you.
GDQ is the best. Thanks to everyone involved!
ORB
I should be sleeping, but I had to stay up for my all time favorite Tetris game! You're all awesome for what you do and here's to another fantastic GDQ!
Patty said to donate so I'm donating. Thank you for a decade of fun, I hope there's a decade more.
tetrisphere is one of my favorite games of all time! shout outs to neil voss who composed the soundtrack
3D rubix tetris is too much while this sleep deprived
TetrisORB has a plot line? Rescue the robot! What madness is this?! May your blocks be round, FFR! Let's clear cancer like clearing Tetris lines.
First time donatingGood luck to everyone
It's a great big marathonLet's make cancer super punyPatty, here's my donationIt's 10 whole smackeroonis
I heard your donation guy was getting bored. My wife demanded that to be fixed! GG, and good day.
Donating in honor of my father who survived prostate cancer and was diagnosed with bone marrow cancer just after Christmas.Here's towards a future where cancer is no longer a major disruption to the lives of individuals and families.
Heard my favorite common-tater was getting bored, so I had to drop one more donation for Patty. Have fun everyone!
I'm disappointed by the lack of ORB in this game.
This is for one of my good friends from college, who just found out she has ovarian cancer. Luckily, it was caught early, earlier than it usually is, but she is heading into chemo treatments this week. Good luck Onlera <3
Hello from Germany!I've been watching GDQ for a long time now but still always look forward to the events. Super excited for a week of awesome speedruns that will completely break my sleep schedule.Good luck to all the runners and a huge shoutout to everyone involved.
We have nothing to sphere but sphere itself. Also, dang this game has hot jams! Crank it!
I have *no* idea what's going on here, but this is oddly compelling.Greetings from back couch!
This game gave me nightmares as a kid from the easter egg you got holding down the reset button. Seeing it trounced like this is... cathartic. Thanks for that.
Great to see a niche favorite of mine in this event. The incentive said the last Rescue is the hardest level... but I don't remember anything comparing to the Crystal Tower levels in Hide and Seek. Those levels were the definition of losing out of nowhere.
Rescue those googly eyes!
for my girlfriend andy who woke me up at 3 in the morning to sit in the audience for this delightful game
Yo Tay what uuuuup! Sorry I couldn’t make it this year, but stoked to see you on the couch for another of my N64 puzzle faves! So when’s your PPL 3D-mode run?
Shout outs from the front row for the most underrated N64 game. First person Tetris is lit.
Good morning to all you beautiful people.And hi Patty.Here's to a great week! Good luck to all the runners and... greetings from Germany.
Anyone else remember the most sophisticated gaming experience ever created by humans? It's spherical! SPHERICAL!
Hey, how are ya?
I don't understand this game, but it looks like you're doing great, so here's some money
It’s 11 AM here in Sweden, enjoying a late breakfast and watching AGDQ is a great way to start the week. Keep up the good work!
The sphere is a lie! The grid is on a donut with a fish eye lens. Anyway, put my donation to sonic'06.
Tetris shennanigans are always a thing of beauty. Speaking of beauty, how about those OoT Stained Glass Spiritual Stones? Times almost up, better get those donations in now folks...
Always good to hear Patty on the mic. Donating in support of this utterly baffling N64 block.
Love ya'll! Let's prevent cancer with awesome games speeded through, my favorite event of the year!100 $ train? :eyes_emoji:
This Tetris Sphere run is comforting to watch, reminding me of my childhood playing Puzzle Pirates. Shout out to flappy hat lady in the crowd!
Donating during the game that brought my mom and me together in gaming
Hey Patty thanks for holding us down during the late nights.Cant wait for you to commentate during Awful Games later this week always the spotlight of my Agdq week.Heres ten dollary-doos now and I'll be back to drop some more for the greatness that is Awful Games.Good luck to all the runners this week.
Have you all heard about the new Tetris movie?It's getting delayed because every time they finish a line, it disappears.Had to add my own bad pun hopefully it gets read out to make the crowd groad with happiness. Love what you all do here is to another 10 years
Let me out of here already!
Watching while I work the overnight shift. I'm always surprised to see games I didn't know existed get played so masterfully. Also, I'd love to hear the announcer say their favorite tongue twister for another donation.
Long time watcher, first time donator.This is one of my favourite events of the year, and now that I'm finally armed with a decent job, I figure some of it should go to a good cause.Keep up the great work!
Enjoying the runs so far :)Lets get those Bonus Games met.
Good morning from Germany.With this week I am still on my holidays from work to catch the entire AGDQ atleast I try. Sleep less run more!
There is really nothing to fear about this game, except sphere itself.
GDQ always brings a smile to my face, so I gotta donate. Good job to all the runners and night crew!
Bon début de semaine à tout les runners, tout les ambianceurs, tout les commentateurs, tout les viewers sur tout les chat de chaque pays. Paix et amour dans la communauté du jeu vidéo contre le boss final : CANCER. Des coeurs d'amour à tous. #goupixGood start to the week to all the runners, all the ambianciers, all the commentators, all the viewers on all the chats in each country. Peace and love in the video game community against the final boss: CANCER. Hearts of love to all.
It's no use!
Revelry in the dark. Good luck to all the runners!
Superstar Saga hype! One of my GBA favorites. Played a lot of it, mainly because my cart is faulty so I had to start over every time I turned it on. Looking forward to the Bros dancing along to the battle music!
Oh wow ten years, thank you to everyone involved with GDQ for the journey and the memories.
I was supposed to wake up early for the Mario and Luigi run, but never fell asleep. Could really use some caffeine right about now. Hope the rest of the night troupe is doing well!
My father had cancer caught early. I wish similar luck. To all the runners, best of luck and entertainment for charities sake.

Always happy to donate to a really good cause, and I cannot wait to see a speedrun of one of my favourite RPGs ever, Mario & Luigi Superstar Saga.
thank you to those still awake, from those who are also still awake. bada bing bada boom wheres the hype in this room?
Thanks GDQ for being here for all us night shift workers.
Greetings from Japan! Watching the AGDQ live for the first time, and I'm excited to give to the cause! Thanks for keeping me entertained while I'm making dinner. Keep it up everyone!
Merci a tout les commentateurs pour votre travail, et merci pour la découverte de tetrisphere, un régal (non) #MarioLight
Here's $50 for that tongue-twister from Patty, Never heard that one before!
I'm not John, but that was an impressive tongue twister.Cheers!
Well, I said I would donate if you did a tongue twister, and here it is! Sadly my coworker made me miss the last bit of it, but what I heard was truly wonderful. You da best! Donation goes to announcers choice!
Wow, the music is so great Is there a GDQ playlist somewhere? I'd so listen to it. Thanks for everything you guys do, stay awesome!
Almost lunchtime in germany. :o) Looking forward to my break with AGDQ. :-)Greetings and have fun!
Got up early to donate while one of my favorite games plays. Thanks everyone for this marathon and ten years of content, can’t wait to see how long it goes.
Hey guys, good luck on the run. Oh, and Sjorec- don't forget to get away from the doors.
It's the most wonderful time of the year. Good luck to all the runners!
Quel plaisir de retrouver le monde merveilleux des GDQ ! Bienvenue aux nouveaux et, comme toujours, merci à toute l'équipe du FrenchRestream, vous êtes au top ! Bonne année et excellent marathon à tous ! Des bisous #MarioLight
I can’t believe they’d allow such explosive language in a Nintendo game.
Hey all! Had to donate for the Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga run and also the amazing GhostKumo on the couch! Cheers!
[FR] Please keep the good work guyZ
Have been watching agdq since I woke up yesterday, which was about 1 pm central, 2pm where gdq is held. I've been watching the youtube part for a few years, and last year, almost to the day, I finally caught a livestream. Glad I can finally donate to support an amazing cause like the prevention of cancer. Donation goes to making Bayonetta 2 played on 3rd Climax
[FR] @Dec4rius : Toujours un plaisir de donner pour cette fondation, une personne proche à vaincu son cancer ! Abats la maladie ! #TempeteDivine (Je vous aime tous ! Mais plus @Aelthan)[EN] @Dec4rius : Always a pleasure to give to this foundation, a person close to defeating her cancer! Take down the disease! And Kill the animal Kappa
FAWFUL HAS CHORTLES
I love this game! Peace and love
It is a lot easier to wake up for work when you have AGDQ to watch. And it is a lot easier to get through the workday when you can stream at work. Keep up the amazing work everyone!
Superstar Saga's one of my favorite games of all time; good luck on the run, Murmilio & Sjorec!
Long time watcher and couple time donator here. Got really excited when AGDQ started and have already ruined my sleep schedule watching the first runs. Superstar saga is one of my favorite childhood games and replayed it lots of times as a kid. Good luck to all the runners this week and thanks to all the staff for organising this awesome event!
Greetings from Ireland. I'm sleep deprived from watching gyms awesome run last night but couldn't miss superstar saga co-op. My girlfriend and I are watching at work from our jobs and loving the run. We love watching gdq together. Thanks for having this awesome game we Europeans can watch and congrats on 10 years.
Just want to wish "good luck!" to all runners. Keep it up guys! Let's beat that cancah' !
Superstar Saga is one of my all-time favorite games! I used to do co-op runs on the Gamecube Gameboy Player because all controllers register as Player 1, with one person limited to the A button only and the other B only, including on Bros. Attacks! It made the game a great team experience. Keep up the great work guys and best of luck on the run!
Best of luck to all the runners. You're all fantastic, don't give up!
Good luck to both Mur and Sjorec! Shoutouts from the back couch, and also, don't fail the minecart minigame.
AGDQ's sweet stream will soon be the bread that makes the sandwich of Prevent Cancer Foundation's desires! And this donation shall be the delicious mustard on that bread! The mustard of cancer's doom!
Have to donate for one of my favorite games of my childhood. I remember the countless times I had to hide my Gameboy under my pillow and having to figure out how to hit both the "A" and "B" buttons at the same time with my little thumb. GLHF to the runners!

I want to thank that random guy who worked in a welsh game shop, who suggested I watch GDQ around 4 years ago, I've watched it every single year since! Looking forward to the next 10 years of GDQ!
Greetings from Colorado. Superstar Saga is my favorite Mario RPG, so I'm up early on a work day to watch this run. Can't wait to see how Murmilio expertly controls Mario and... the Green one. Good luck, and save the beans.

Joined in time for one of my favourite games, GL for the run!
Had to donate during Mario & Luigi, loved the game growing up and still a great game. Thank you to my wife Caitlin for the surprise donation in the previous run. good work to everyone at GDQ and keep up the amazing work.
Long time watcher and I actually work for a company that tries to beat cancer i figuered why not spend some for this awesome cause too.
Super Mario hype! Beyond excited to watch one of my favorite speedrunners play one of my favorite childhood games! Good luck, Murmilio!
I set my alarm for 4:30 to catch this run of my absolute favorite game. Keep up the great work. Year of Luigi!
Je ne sais pas trop quoi dire, donc je me contenterai de dire que je suis ravi de participer à cet événement. Bravo et bon courage pour l'ensemble du marathon !#TempeteDivine
Woke up at 4:30 in the morning just to see this run!! Good luck to Murmillo and Sjorec with that dreaded final boss! I HAVE FURY
Been watching AGDQ since 2013 and always excited to see it live. Even more exciting is seeing Murmilio speedrunning Superstar Saga once more. Good luck everyone!
Man I haven't played this game (Mario and Luigi Superstar saga) since I was kid. Thanks AGDQ for bringing back the nostalgia where my strongest memory is being stuck for hours as I didn't realise you could turn Luigi into a surfboard.
Woozle Wazzle
Murmillio's movement with Luigi was legit godly. I'm hooked man. Good job finding these guys AGDQ

Dance dad is KICKIN IT TODAY! GO GO!!!
Good morning from New Jersey, USA! First time watching GDQ; my mother was diagnosed with cancer in early 2019; thank you for supporting such an amazing cause, keep up the good work.
Been watching since near the very beginning and never had the chance to donate until now, so I’m finally putting a bit into the pot myself in memory of my Grandmother’s passing from cancer about 5 years back now. Putting this towards Sonic ‘06, after her jokingly calling me “Tails” during my long binges of Sonic gaming after school. Besides, nobody can deny that rocking soundtrack no matter how bad the game is!
OH WOW! Its Skyblazer! this was the first game i ever had and when i told friends about it nobody ever believed me that it was a real game.
I watched GDQ for many times and its now to donate. love klonoa speed run in one of the previous GDQ and hope we can see new speed run for klonoa 2 ...and good luck to all speed runners
First time donating ! Let's beat Câncer togheter!Let's Go to Sonic 2006!Haha
My dad was diagnosed with cancer last year, after a couple of stressfull months he is now recovering. Thank you guys for putting in the effort for charity, keep up the good work.
Hey! I gotta donate for the man who literally wrote the book on speedrunning. Good luck Omni, and shout outs to Blechy on the couch! Always great to see you both!
Woooo! Excited for Skyblazer baby!
I need a Sonic 06 run like I need air! Plus it'll give me incentive to wake up early.Also hi to my slime pals, here's to a fun week of chilling out and watching speedruns!
Just Love! Thx guys ... long time follower ... Kill the animals
I've never heard of Skyblazer before now, but I love just how much it reminds me of Hook and it's always a treat to see something new. Good luck Omni and here's to ten years of GDQ.
De retour pour ce super event !!Merci à tous les commentateurs de donner de leur temps pour nous et pour la bonne cause.Go bourrer les dons !!! #DarkMage
Blechy and Omni together? What an embarrassment of riches!! $250 for both Omni and Belchy's choice. Keep up the good work GDQ. My mother was diagnosed several years ago with cervical cancer and early detection helped her get treated and is still around to this day. Truly a worthy cause.
Thank you, Omni for a wonderful run to wake from my childhood!
Skyblazer has been the best commentary of the run, to the point I plan to pick it up and try it!Incentive to The Outer Worlds, let's get Taako back on TV!
Donating for my favorite underappreciated SNES game. Screw cancer and destroy Raglan!
Hey bro, so great to see you do another run of Skyblazer at this AGDQ. Just a sellout donation to mention Speedrun Science, your book on speedrunning :) Love you!

Good morning Howard and gdq
Good morning everyone! First day at work after more than 2 weeks of leisure with family, friends, gaming and many long nights. No suprise that I feel like a wreck after getting up so early today. But thanks to agdq I have an enjoyable day so far! Shoutouts to Fabian, Domino and Isabelle - and the dancer in the front row! What is your name? More donation coming up tomorrow!
So pumped to see this Mystical Ninja Race. I tried to learn the run several years ago and am happy to see how the routing has changed and especially how the runners dealt with the money-problem. YOU out there. Go play all of the Mystcial Ninja (Ganbare Goemon) Games. They are amazing.
Super excited to see The Legend of the Mystical Ninja race! Best of luck to both participants, and Go Teleo Go!!
Go GDQ!
ANNOUNCER KNOWS WHAT'S UP!!! Can't beat the creepiness of Sonic CD's US Game over music
Here’s $5 for the dude dancing on the cam, he’s an American hero.
Dance Dance Revolution speedrun with Dance Dad, please.
Greetings from Brooklyn New York! Just returning to work from an amazing weekend of intense volunteering and spending time with friends at Magfest. Now the fun continues while watching the amazing talent at AGDQ. From the fantastic speed runners, to the charismatic individuals on the couch and announcers working overtime to keep us hyped. And to all of those watching please give yourself a round of applause. You deserve it! Let us beat cancer!
Dancing guy, I've been watching GDQ for years now and this is my first time donating. Seeing people again and again (not only runners) regularly on this stream is what makes me happy every time. Love you, Keep dancing!Hello from France! Germench HYPE

Thank you Dance Dad for enjoying Let's Go Away from the Daytona USA soundtrack. It made my GDQ.
Had to donate when my girl Liz was on hosting duty. Good luck to all the runners and staff and keep on making the world a better place. Much love.
Good Morning GDQ! Looking forward to a fun-filled week of speedruns and no work productivity. Shout out to the guy in the front row that's been keeping the party going all morning, you rock dude. Let's see that Sonic '06 run.
I have no idea what is going on but it's strangely fascinating. Good luck to all runners. Peace.

I've been watching GDQ for several years now, and I always love seeing new games done faster than I could ever imagine them done! This one's for my Grandpa who died of lung cancer.
AGDQ Hype! Wife had pre cancerous growths but avoided cervical cancer by going to yearly check-ups. Early detection is key - stay safe, get check ups! Love from Norway!
Good morning, GDQ!
Honk for dancing dad, man's got moves! Keep up the great work GDQ staff! Dancing dad too! Bringing those smiles out!

It's Day 2 of AGDQ, and I feel fine! Awesome runs all around, even if I couldn't stay awake for al of them! (Cursed human weaknesses)
Hey KLM! You've been a huge part of my speedrunning life, and I'm really happy to see you on stage! (also hi alex!!)
Good Morning Everyone! There's nothing better on a sick day than watching speed runners destroy Cancer! Let's get that first Bonus game cause who doesn't want to see more of Sonic 06?
Had to donate for the ActRaiser game, because this one actually was the first game I saw as a speedrun and which ultimately got me more into them.Good luck to the runner!
Another donation. Keep up the good work. Greetings from Germany.
Glad to see some oldschool racing in the morning.
Mah man Metroid McFly on the big stage once more! Looking forward to all Acts being Raised. And Syn, the only one brave enough to face the human TAS. This donation goes to winner's choice, and loser will get a consolation box of Waffle Crisp. Now go be Professionals!!!
Hyped to see the ActRaiser race! This was one of my favorite games as a kid and McFly is one of my favorite streamers. Go fast!
Hey AGDQ, First time donation from my side, i realy love the way you collect money for such a great foundation. My mother and my father both luckily beat their cancer, and i hope with our help, lots of other people will do too! Best regards from Germany

Always cool to see people rally together for a good cause like this. Thanks to everyone streaming and donating!
Love donating for a good cause, and hey, if I could get a battletoads shirt for my wife, even better.Good luck to all the runners this week.
good luck
Can Sonic '06 be broken even more than it normally is? I am willing to find out.
first time donating. Actraiser is one of my favorite snes game
Love watching the show every year :) Good luck to all runners!
I've played Dark Souls, I've played the first Zelda, the first Metroid and all. But Actraiser is the game I hated the most, cause I can't get for heavens sake through the last boss. So naturally that's the game I had to donate during. GL to the runners! Lots of love (and hate) from Germany.
Donating in memory of my mom who died of cancer in November. She got me ActRaiser for Christmas when I was a lad, so I am honored to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation during this beautiful game. Good luck to the racers!
That Paper Mario TTYD Watercolor sounds great, and who could not love Actraiser! Good luck in the rest of the week everyone! I'll be watching.
So hyped for this Actraiser race and even more hyped to donate to this great cause. Keep up the good work, GDQ. And let's put this donation towards CV 4 hard mode incentive!
My GF paid for pizza last night, so here's my pizza money!
Donating for Bonus Game 1 for my friend Focus, who is doing said run. We’ve been friends for something like 6 years at this point and I’m very proud that he’s going to get Silver No MSG on the big screen. The run has changed an unbelievable amount since Parax/Aruki’s run 7 years ago, and there’s nobody better to show it off.
Yes. ActRaiser. Yes. Please.
I don't know what's happening to me.I'm getting all the blame for things I didn't do.Will anyone please tell me what I did wrong?I'm all alone and oh so confused.I don't know what everyone wants me to be.I only know just how to be me.Once I was the ape of the hour.Not they think I'm a coward.An absolute zero,I'm nobody's hero.
Super hyped for this ActRaiser race sYn is one of my favorite streamers. One of the best examples of a welcoming and amazing speedrunner. Sad there are no teddy grahams
Hey GDQ, I hope you’re all doing great so far!First time donator here. Since almost literally stumbling across some of your VODs 2 or 3 years ago (thanks to Youtube for this one!) I’ve watched quite a few of them with great interest and am now able to catch GDQ live for the first time!Losing my mother to cancer late last year hit me pretty hard, after having cared for her for most of 2019. Hopefully this will help so that others can have their friends or loved ones around for longer. Keep doing what you’re doing!All the best to everybody and greetings from Germany!
WOW!
A humble request for someone to attempt the DK rap during the Donkey Kong Country 3 run
First time donating, just wanna say y'all are doing a great job. Raise some acts! Can I get a "HEAR-YE, HEAR-YE" from the host?
It's now been four years since I won my own fight with cancer. I'm glad to donate to the good fight while watching one of my all-time favorite games: ActRaiser. Let's stay DETERMINED to beat cancer, friends.
This is for Sherbear.
Tuning in shortly before work. Can't help but love all the speedruns and support what AGDQ is doing!
Great to see Syn Stream raise some Act.Praise Waldo!
long time viewer first timer donater lets save those frames boyyyyys
Good morning, AGDQ! Lizstar, I hope you're having a fantastic morning! Thanks for holding the fort down during my workday. And now, time to further procrastinate! Everyone in chat, stay hydrated! YOU GOTTA GRIP'N'SIP!!!
A few months ago I got a job where I can half-watch AGDQ while I work. If I'm getting paid to watch speedruns, it only seems right that I pay that money forward to help fight cancer. Thank you all for what you do.
Great race! And I'm so pumped for the upcoming "& Block"! Good luck to all the runners.
Good Luck Colin! Much Love from the Kotor Community!
Glad I could donate to such a great cause! 4th year watching AVGDQ!
Run, Run, Run, as fast as you can! They can't catch you, you're the speedrunner, man! Setting this towards naming Wingull JOTARO!?! in Pokemon Sapphire. ORA!
Shoutout for the potato crew
Shout out to DANCE DAD
Good luck!
Keep up the good work AGDQ!!
Donating for my friend Sara, who is currently battling stage 4 cancer, I hope one day no-one will have to go through what she is. Great job folks !
best luck to all runner wanted to donate on Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga but got denied by paypal
Took the week off to watch the 10th anniversary of GDQ! Have been watching since CGDQ, and look forward to many more!
Left the stream on while I went to make breakfast. Sprinted back into the room when I heard about the Sonic 06 Bonus Incentive. If we all chip in, it’s sure to be of *some* use, right?
Did someone say Sonic '06?? How can I not donate to see the objectively best sonic game of all time? ...Nope, couldn't say that with a straight face...
Battletoads & Double Dragon is my favourite game from my childhood. There will be no better time to make a donation 😁Greetings from Poland.Kill the cancer 🏹🦀
Only watch speedrunning on AGDQ, but love the cause! Blechy is a great host!
I need to see this Sonc 2006 run. Honk!
GDQ GDQ woo woo woo!

Quel plaisir de vous retrouver pour une nouvelle semaine de réjouissances avec des gens qui courent vite. Des bisous à tous (sauf à Ridlaids) #LonaLink
Greetings from right here! Trying to prevent the 06 run from happening? It's no use!
Honk! Towards the Rash plush
There's a long history of cancer on both sides of my family, and I lost both my grandfather's to cancer. One of whom I never got to know. This is the first year I've been able to donate, thought I've been watching since 2014, and I'm glad it can go to such a good cause. Good luck to all the runners.Donation to runners choice.
Put this towards Sonic 06 please. I need more of that game in my life.
Donating for my dog Luke, who I had put down this morning. He was a good boy.
Long time watcher, first time donator here. Can't wait for V0oid's run of DKC3. Rooting for you like always!
Let's go DKC3! Get those raw- I mean green bananas!
Here's to preventing cancer and to the most underappreciated DKC game! Incentive goes to DKC 3 filename Honk. I'll do another $50 if the crowd yells "HONK!"
That was an amazing run! Not to mention that the intro music for the game is so good
Greetings from Beijing, China!I had The Great Circus Mystery as a kid but never managed to beat it. MAKE IT BEG FOR MERCY.We don't say hype out here we say 'Jia Yo' which means 'add oil'Jia Yo my dudes! So proud of all the speedrunners and donors this week!
To a speedy recovery and to successful chemo
I love the dancing Dad <3
The Great Circus Mystery Starring Mickey and Minnie was one of my favorite games to play as a kid; I used to make my parents play it with me for hours! I can’t wait to see it be destroyed in a speed run! I’m watching with my 2-year-old and a soon-to-be-born-baby in utero, both of whom I look forward to playing this game with in the future!
So fortunate to be at AGDQ for the second time with my best friend Lew! Happy ten year anniversary, GDQ, let's put an end to cancer!
Hi guys, im from Germany and very thankful for your amazing support and all those nice runs! Im a Snesmaniac and enjoy this RUNS WITH A BUNCH OF BEERS! CHEERS!

Honk
I am so happy that GDQ is finally back! Cannot wait for all of the awesome runs coming up and also for everything during the week. Thank you for everyone making this amazing event happen!
Always love watching AGDQ, good luck to all the runners. I'll donate an additional $0.50 for everyone who follows me on twitter today. Save those animals.
Sonic 06 is the game we need to see! Gotta donate fast or else it's NO USE!
Dance Dad is love, Dance Dad is life! love you all, gl hf!
C'est vrai qu'il est trop mignon ce Cacodémon, je le veux ! #zhtDoom
Want to thank all the amazing speedrunners and donaters supporting a good cause. Let's see that Sonic-06 run!
Here's a little something from me, to say thanks for all you do. Expect more throughout the week
The earlier donation about being able to watch while working inspired me to also donate, as I'm fortunate enough to be able to do the same. Props to GDQ, the runners, all the contributors, and of course PVC. Love to all those battling cancer or knows someone who is.
Here's to a decade of GDQ. Seems appropriate to donate the 10 bucks I was going to spend on lunch.
Great work guys!!
Loads of respect for the skills and dedication of all the runners, announcers, and organizers. Thanks for everything you all do, and may you have incredible runs!
Donkey think this run is great?! Kong you believe these time saves?!
Sonic 06 is the best worst game. This is my first time catching a GDQ live, and the first time I've been able to donate!
Honk!
Thank you for all that you do and to all the crew, runners and staff!
Thanks for all you guys do! <3
Salut les Kongs ! Toujours un plaisir de revenir ici, même si revenir à l'AGDQ signifie qu'on s'est toujours pas débarassé du cancer. Continuez à bourrer les dons, on finira par lui casser la bouche. Des bisous à l'orga, au tchat, aux modos (pas à Moa, par contre) !
Sonic Block's around the corner, and we still need to close out the '06 incentive! My sources tell me if FocusSight destroys this game at AGDQ, no one will ever have to play Sonic '06 again! Do it for the future! (Honk!)
much love :)
V0oidW
<3
i got out of bed to donate immediately when i heard there was a sonic 06 incentive
smile check :)
Love watching games I grew up with getting some love and attention from GDQ. Keep going strong boys and girls
Long time seeing first time donating, let's keep the amazing work.
Sonic 06 you say? Take my money!
Will miss the DKC run, so am donating now, thanks for a great event!
GDQ is making the first day of my last semester of college so much better, but less productive. Had to donate to get the worst game I've ever played, Sonic 06, onto the stream. Thanks for everything you all do
First Time Donting, GL to all Runners and have fun!
It’s so surreal seeing this game after 25 years. My sister and I used to play this game all the time and get into fights over who got to land the final hit on the final boss. Ahhh memories.
Gotta go fast!
My coworkers keep trying to talk to me! Don't they know I'm watching AGDQ??? Let's get that Sonic '06 on deck so I can really have a great Monday!
I’m donating 5 dollars for each of my favorite people at GDQ. Shoutout to Ian, Jess, and Miles. HAWNK it up!
Isn't every boss a "Minnie" boss?
Great!
Thank you for supporting such a great cause!
It's some use.Put this towards the Sonic 2006 bonus game.
This is the first year watching AGDQ with my husband, we watched many years before together. Here is to get the Sonic bonus game. Would Sonic also say HONK?
Loved the GDQ events since I first learned about them in 2014 and still been a fan of seeing the games be broken. Lets tell cancer "It's No Use"by putting this donation towards Sonic 06, because much like Silver, we too have a dream to change the future.
HONK
GDQ has the best vibes in all of gaming, thanks for all the hard work! Here's $50 for Sonic 06 because life is hard and we should all bond over everlasting loading screens and uncomfortable romantic subplots. Lots of love from Norway!
let there be bep
Vive les GDQ, et merci au FrenchRestream pour leur travail. #GDQup
Good Luck for all the runners Greeting from Finland
Hey V0oid, have you heard of Donkey Kong Country 2 HD Remake Bramble Scramble? It's one of my favorite DKC HD Nostalgie remasters and you should give it a listen! Good luck on your runYour Favorite Otter#rollindeep

Good luck to my man V0oid on the DKC 103% run. There is no one better to finally showcase this run at GDQ.

Long time watcher, first time donator. Now that I’m in college I have the whole week off with nothing to do but watch some great games being played fastly!
Good luck V0oid! DKC3 one of the best games ever made.
If the TheYetee doesn't own a T-shirt cannon named "The YEET-y", they should get on that.
We need more HONK.
Put it toward Sonic '06... for all your amusement needs. And one more thing... HONK
Hey v0oid!! Is this world record??

Having played Sonic 06 casually on stream last year, I had to donate when I found out there was an incentive for the game. Remember, folks: it's no use.
Amazing event for a great cause. Thank you for being awesome!
Sonic 06? Honk Yeah!
Allez pour la DKTV il faut donner ! #MarioLight
Long time viewer, first time attendee/volunteer. Everyone I've met so far has been so friendly and amazing and that bone guitar looks dope. Lost my Aunt to cancer a few years back and I don't want to see others lose their loved ones anymore.
Donating to see Sonic 06 get destroyed! Don't tell me it's no use!
Hey! Been watching in absolute amazement for the past 4 years. After every run I always hear the runners giving shout outs to friends, family and gdq staff. I'd like to give a shout out of my own. Shout out to all the people fighting cancer right now. You're all warriors and we know you can beat cancer, so hang in there and kick cancers ass! (Feel free to say butt here lol) because the world loves you, and most importantly the world NEEDS you. <3 Love you all
My grandma passed from lung cancer around 30 years ago without being able to meet a single one of her grandchildren. a year ago her sister was diagnosed with the same type of cancer but thanks to early detection her treatment has been going smoothly, the tumor has been significantly reduced and she is basically out of danger! So I'm very thankful to organizations like PCF for these progresses and to GDQ for supporting the cause! On another note my bestie travelled all the way from Dominican Republic to spend his birthday watching the event and he's sitting right there in the audience! Can I get a "Happy Birthday Juan" from the audience to make his experience even better?!
Thanks to all the runners and staff who make this event possible. Good luck to all the runners and have a great event!
Rollin in! Glad to see my boy V0oid running DKC3 103%. Need to donate during his run and wish him the best of luck. Let´s roll deep and kick cancers butt! GDQ HYPE <3
Cancer Bad, Speedrunning good
YEET
So excited for the DKC3 run. Often overlooked, never under loved. This is the one I have the most fond memories of playing as a kid with my brother. Excited to see V0oid rip this game apart.
AGDQ is, as always, ... tihi ... awesome. Good Luck to Void!
greetings from austria, first time donating, been watching for multiple years and i'm happy to finally be able to contribute to this great causeshoutouts to all my wonderful friends and all the wonderful people working to make this event happen
Long time donator first time viewer. I don't really understand what's going on but you kids seem to be having fun. Who are the animals, and why do they need saving? Anyway... I think I donated towards the sonic incentive. Why broken games are good I don't know, but hopefully you all can show me why.-Grammy Cath
Love to all of GDQ, so much hype for a DKC3 run! And for the person reading this, you're awesome!
Had to get in during Donkey Kong Country 3, the first soundtrack I ever owned, setting me on a lifelong video game music obsession. (Shoutouts to weird Jack in the Box Happy Meals.)
En hommage au chien le plus "glop glop" de France, renommons le chien de Rinoa "Pif" ! Car c'est aussi un gadget et "pif", on le balance sur les ennemis ! Bisous bisous ! Ouaf !
Beep Boop.
French donator here big shootout to LeFrenchRestream !!!Since 2017 i started to watch The Games Done Quick and never had the possibility to donate for a good cause, thank you for your marathons every year keep going !!!!!
What's up v0oid? DKC3 was my very first video game and I've been waiting since 2012 to see this category finally get its time in the sun. Donations go to Sonic 06, an extra $10 for one cycle Kaos. And as always, #RollDeep
This run had better be bananas.
~ h o n k ~
Speedrun strats saved me from Silver's wrath and the number ball section hell when I was playing Sonic 06 for the first time this year. This donation towards getting it as a bonus game is the least I can do to give back
Super excited for this DKC 3 speedrun! Good luck!
To one of my favorite games and one of my favorite events! Happy AGDQ everyone! HJONK.
Been looking forward to this, V0oid! Beat the WR
Best of luck to my main man, V0oid! Go catch those gnarly waves, bro, and keep on ROLLING DEEP to prevent cancer!
Donkey Kong HYPE!
DKC 2 was my childhood, but I loved DKC 3 very much! Let's see DKC 2 next year!!!!
The amount of money you've raised thus far is bananas! Good luck on the run, V0oid!
His coconut... wait, wrong game. Great work, keep it up!
Good luck to my man V0oid from your friends from the whatever discord and remember: Only love can defeat the Sui_min_Dragon
Good luck on the run V0oid! And how about a round of applause for the runners and GDQ staff who arrange this amazing event?
Love the marathon every year but gotta donate for the best DKC game, cant wait to see the 103% run.
Triste déception pour DK TV, Mais il reste Pokémon et FF VIII donc après Tatoualène, voici Leon ! (Vive KH)
Patrick Pichette and Maude Dignard loves you
Hype for Dixie and Kiddy rolling out to fight cancer in the BEST Donkey Kong Country on the Super Nintendo! (yeah I said it)
Happy GDQ everyone! Thanks so much to the runners, organizers, and staff for making this event go off so well each year. It's responsible for some of my best friendships, so let's all join together to raise as much as we can!
Dkc is always one of my favorite runs to watch. Can’t wait to watch void crush the 103% category
I absolutely love DKC3 and played it for hours when I was a kid. Here's to a good cause...HONK
Shoutouts to the DKC game that's objectively the best and to one of my favorite runners in all of speedrunning, V0oid. Shoutouts coming from Berlin, Germany!
Been watching GDQ for years, happy to be able to support such an amazing cause. Keep up the good work, and let's see that Sonic '06 run!
That Kremling Coin looks absolutely stellar. I'm unlikely to get it, but hey, charity right? Glad I woke up just in time for the DKC3 run, haven't missed any of the DKC runs since I started watching the GDQ runs.
Figured I might as well donate after writing my first college paper on speedrunning... Love the trans inclusivity in this community and I cannot wait to see the trauma center run!
let's make cancer a sad, forgotten relic just like kiddy kong
TTYD Watercolor World Map? Yes please!
This won't make sense in english, but it will to V00ID."Ah-vo-ay V00ID, tail mayor, ace tea"
Hey V0oid, good luck with the run and Boomer skip and clips be blessed!
I wish my friend James was awake so that he could see this awesome DKC3 run.
My son is obsessed with Meowser so I need that one!
v0oid! About dang TIME this run makes it into GDQ! I didn’t actually bother to look up where the bear skips are, so I just decided to give you $10 per Bear. (ish)Shoutouts to your AMAZING kouch krew. Looking forward to a v0oidNiceRun.
Trouvez le piece! Collectez 30 etoiles!
It's a lovely day on the island, and you are a horrible K. Rool. Honkey Kong Country!
How can it be called Donkey Kong Country 3 if there's no Donkey Kong? I demand justice for our favorite monkey. In the meantime put this donation towards the Sonic 06 incentive. Gotta go fast!
I've been watching GDQ for a long time now and I'm happy to be able to make my first contribution to this amazing event. Watching it grow bigger and bigger every year really makes me hopeful for a better future for us all. Together we can do anything! So yeah, I'd like to thank everyone involved in this: runners, couch, hosts, tech crew, volunteers, crowd, twitch chat... You are all breathtaking!
More games at AGDQ is always a good thing. Let's Go Everyone!
I'm going to go for 103 percent along side V0oid.... Oh crud, I'm still on title screen! Okay, you take it from here dude! GL on GG.
Been watching GDQ vods for years but never managed to catch it live. Looking forward to a week of goose memes
DKC3 is one of my favorite games. Thanks for the boost of nostalgia this morning and good luck V0OID!!
Yo V0oid! ROLLIN IN! Yesterday my son spoke his first word, and it was "Banana"! so it must be a sign that he rolls deep. GL on the run v0oid
first time able to donate. Been watching for years, keep up the good work.
Saw the awesome prizes and I couldn't help but donate. Haven't seen much Sonic 06 but hoping to see some today. Go get that 103, Void!
Hey Void! Glhf
First donation of the run and we're loving this DKC 3 run. It's always fun to see these games played so well. Good luck to VoOID!

Heyo,Glad to see DKC 103 finally at GDQ. Guess V0oid finally stopped "monkeying" around :P. If you can do a deathless and no bonus fail, I'll do another donation :3
Hole emoji
DONK!

My best friend and I would stay up all night to play the DKC series. He was legally blind and would love how inclusive GDQ and their events always are. We never beat DKC3 so I can't wait to watch it get destroyed!
Last month I learned that I have a rare type of pre-Leukemia called Myelodysplastic Syndrome (MDS). Chemotherapy will start soon for me... Here is a donation for all the homies out there fighting Cancer. Don't give up. Thank you AGDQ and all the Runners for providing such a fun event and keeping Retro Gaming alive.
Taken a week of vacation so I can watch as much as possible of the amazing speed runs. Thank you all for making this event possible.
It's always a good time when v0oid is rollin deep.
DKC3 and some amazing prizes!? Have to donate during this game full of Krazy Kremling Krocs and Kritters! Also we are so close to the first Bonus Game! With so many Bonus Barrels in this game, lets get that Bonus!
Gotta go to work but I'm rooting for all of you! Sonic '06!
To everyone who runs a game at GDQ your amazing and thank you for all your hard work! To all the wonderful people that make GDQ possible you are miracle workers and also amazing! Love and peace!
Used to play DKC3 with my brother when I was a kid, though I don't recall ever getting past the second level. Shoutouts from Bolivia! We love what you do!

I just lost the game pepeHands
Every year I tune in for what I can, and every year I'm thrilled to see more and more interesting runs alongside classic fun. Let's end cancer, and replace it with smiles!
Hey, it's my first time seeing V0oid in color. Love Rambi BTW

Love me some GDQ. This goes to SONIC '06 and I just lost the game.Will do an additional donation of $100 if read by announcer!
Vooid runs deep when he needs to. He's the first member of the DK crew.
I've always loved Donkey Honk Country 3 more than DKC1 honestly, really cool to see a 103% run. T-honks to all the speedrunners and staff for putting on a great event!
this game has been my childhood!ALLERLEI GESCHREI
Just a small Honk :)
Go AGDQ, keep helping people, the world needs this. God help you.
This run is bananas! Sorry we couldn’t help you out, Dixie and Kiddy. We’re a bit *tied up* at the moment. Good luck DK crew
AGDQ is such a great way to start a new year. Good luck to all the runners!
The spider Animal Companion in DKC2 and 3 is named Squitter the Spider, not Shoes. Otherwise fantastic run so far V0OID.Donation goes to runner's choice.
I remember playing this with my brother in my dad's old restaurant on the SNES. So many memories! First donation of this year to AGDQ. Best of luck to all the runners and a big thank you to the staff, audience and everybody involved. HONK
It's been a long time coming, but I am ecstatic to see 103% at the 10th anniversary of GDQ. This category was my very first speedrun in 2013 and has made me involved with the Rollin' Deep community and many other amazing communities. Shoutouts to Techiyo, the pioneer of 103%. I will donate an extra $25 if V0oid nails GDQ Jump. ROLLIN' DEEP
No Honkment
Hi, at demonsmalls here from the back couch. I'm wondering why the game is on French? May Moyai and Winky bless the run.
Yo V0oid, zero here, glad to see you show off this amazing run to the world on a GDQ. Always awesome to see you grind the games on stream, shoutouts to the amazing couch behind you. My grandpa sadly died to lung cancer a couple of years ago, so I have a rather personal reason to donate. Lets beat cancer and don't forget: Heck Rambi.
gj not choking on spider V0oid, rest of the game is free DataFace shoutouts to Supreme for being a cool guy <3
Keep on rolling 😎
Sup V0oid, Jester here! Haven't caught your stream in a long time, but snuck some GDQ during my off hour so I could watch you at school! Keep up the great work, money to V0oid's choice
...I'm not sure you saved it, but you saved it. Here's that $10. #RollDeep
Long time watcher of GDQ replays, Bayleef got me into speedrunning and I’ve always wanted to donate, now is the perfect time, my Great-Grandmother Recently Died of Old Age in December and I felt I Should respect her with this. Donation goes to Groupon the KyogreBut only if They can repeat the Entire tragedy of Death Plagueis The Wise. Also ORBBBBB and MOOOON
Always love watching GDQ, keep doing great work
I've been hearing everybody talk about how excited they are for this run and it has been GREAT! Thanks and best of luck!
Saying hi to the best wife ever. Hi Heidi! Don't let the boss catch you rolling deep!
I really want a Luma plushie. Also, HONK!
For my man Vo0ID: Patrick Pichette here, Maude Dignard wants to tell you shes watching AGDQ for the first time because of you! Rolllll deeeep!!
Rollin' in, all the luck to my boy v0oid. V0oidOk
One of the few times a year I get to see v0oid in color. Sadly won't be there in person this year but good luck on the run and big shout outs to the DKC community. v0oidOk
Rollin in. Good luck v0oid with this awesome run. And shout outs to the great couch. Roll unfathomably deep.
I had my fair share of problems in my family due to cancer, so maybe I can help prevent it for others.
had to donate during V0oids run! His DK2 102% speed runs are what got me into speedrunning.Best this game like I used to beat at MTL PTQs back in the day.
"You have to run, you cannot walk, this is a race against the clock!" Thank you runners and GDQ for supporting a great with games! RUN BOYS! HYYYYPE
Question for Supreme on the Couch: Are you a mod in the GDQ Chat yet?
Hey V0oid,ROLLIN' IN.I want to share my favorite V0oid quote with everyone:"Unless you die, you can never roll to deep. If you roll unfathomably deep and make it out alive, you live to roll deep another day."Good luck on the run, buddy!Love, Breaddy
BEAR IN! Best of luck to my boi V0oid on his 103% run! Shoutout to Goemon legend CLAUDE and the rest of the couch for providing their excellent commentary.
Long time watcher, first time donator! I grew up watching my older sister play DKC 3, so seeing a runner like V0oid destroy it is simply amazing. Good luck on the run, and to all the other runners this GDQ!
I stayed up late to watch Bomberman Hero and now I'm dead on my feet at work, so I hope you guys are happy. Put this toward Sonic 06!
Shoutouts to V0oid for this amazing run of one of my favorite games ever! Rolling deep!
A quick tenner and a shoutout to v0oid, thanks for making my workday more bearable.
HONK! It's no use! Let's see Sonic '06!
Awesome game, awesome couch, awesome run, all on Awesome Games Done Quick!AUGH!
We’re going to hit that Sonic 06 goal and there's nothing that Sonic 06 can do about it. You could almost say, "It's no use!"
Just had to donate during this DKC3-run. It was one of my favourite games as a child but it got stolen! Thank you for an awesome week and a fantastic run this far!
Come on everyone, we can get this Sonic '06 run!!
HONK-ic 2006
This is for my mother-in-law, who passed away from cancer five years ago, and my father-in-law, who has had terminal cancer for over a decade and despite everything is still fighting. Good luck to the runners and punch cancer in the face!
My dad just finished his last round of Chemotherapy. Here's some cash towards preventing future first rounds.
I've been feeling congested recently, think I might have honkitis
Kunga, kunga, kunga!!!!!
Hey guys!Much love from Germany!Today‘s the Birthday of my deceased mother who passed away from a brain tumor almost 5 years ago. As a present to her, I decided to donate during one of my favorite gaming series of all time.Loving what all of you are doing here.
Just a friendly reminder that Krack-Shot Krock is called Purple Strawberry Milkshake Factory. Also, Roll Deep and Stay Hydrated
Greetings from Aersia! Let's bust the barrels of cancer!
Work once again prevents me from catching the Sonic block live, but at least I get to see some good DKC runs.
'Honk' is nice...but it's no 'Orb'
First we roll deep, then we roll around at the speed of sound. Let's keep the good times rolling with Sonic 06. AGDQ 2020, roll out!
Why do the fireballs in Krack Shot Kroc look like Cheetos Puffs? They look incredibly delicious, why don't you feed Squitter? :(
Let's do it again!
Enjoying the run first thing in the morning. Good luck in the Lost world and hopefully no deaths.
Thank you for running one of the first games I ever completed 103%! Thank you for ten years of awesome games and for fielding all of these comments and donations! KEEP. ROLLING. DEEP.

The first time I've been able to donate to a GDQ, I always love watching. Thanks to all the gamers for running.
First of many. I always look forward to GDQ and basking in the glory of some tight runs! In memory of Bevy - every year brings us closer to finishing this fight. Rock on.
Listening to the stream on my phone at work and it's just not the same. Oh well need to work to donate.Good luck in HONKey Kong.
Loving this dkc3 run!
No MSG Sonic Run? I Ike MSG tho.
My aunt just lost her boyfriend to throat cancer this past November, my financial situation doesn't allow me to give much but here is 5 dollars towards nobody having to lose a loved one to cancer
For my beautiful aunt who passed from cancer- so happy to donate to this cause and see all of these gamers come together for an event like this!
Good luck ! #Tempetedesang
Need more Sonic 06 in my life.
We need the Sonic '06 speed run! Also if my brother is watching, hi Pete!
Good look on the run vo0id looking nice so far...also i guess sonic roles deep too so...put my money on the sonic 2006 bonus game. Thanks for all the work behind the scenes :)
This donation will not get me a tax refunded and that is how it should be!
You know why I did this...
As always, a great opening. Let's smash/crush/destroy last years record. Can you say "$4million HYYPE!!"???
Let's get that Sonic 06 run going
Sonic '06 let's goooooooo
Sonic the Hedgehog, you can't catch what you can't see!
Used to play this game with my brother when we were kids. Watching this makes me so happy! Keep up the good work.
I'm down with the flu so GDQ is just what I needed. Shout out to my friend Zack and the awesome dancers in front row. Hyyyype!
Thanks to everyone who makes GDQ possible, y’all are awesome! Shoutouts to v0oid, good luck with the rest of the run! Donation goes to runner’s choice.
I love Donkey Kong Country 3! This game was my jam back in the day. I am an oncology nurse and I see my patients and their families go through really tough times. Just doing my part to help end cancer and take care of those who have it until we do!
One of my favorite games from my childhood—and adulthood! Shout-out to games that break the rules of percentages.
Good Luck!
It's the most wonderful HONK! If the year!!!! I do miss Ooooorrrrrrrbbbb though.... Can we get an Orb from the everyone???
I hope my donation to Sonic 06 Silver's run won't be of "no use"
So fun fact: This game actually comes full circle in a way when it comes to K. Rool. In DKC 1 King K. Rool is on a PIRATE ship. ...in DKC 2, CAPTAIN K. Rool is held up on a flying ship that looks like it was designed by a mad scientist....but in DKC3, the mad scientist Baron K. Roolestien is held up in a castle....fit for a KING.Rather interesting, if you think about it!
Lots of memories of playing DKC3 as a kid with my cousin! Good luck and have fun to all runners! Please put this towards the Sonic 06 incentive!
Watching the stream while lesson planning for the upcoming week! I love watching this event with my husband, and I wanted to donate for him since he's stuck at a training and can't sneak a peek to catch a fave game of his. Love you Pharamos!
Hey All, Yetee here! This DKC3 run is too wild! Wanted to show some love for our favorite animal buddy, Honk, The Goose! HONK!
I've been watching AGDQ since it began. I've never had the money to donate until now. I want to thank all the runners and all the generous people who decided to donate. I lost my mom to ovarian cancer. I've spent all of my adult life serving this country in the Army and now in my state's State Police. Let's do whatever we can to get this solved and prevent cancer from taking another life. Also, Dog better not die in any of the Fallout games!
Let's hit 200k!!
#kongdidnothingwrong GOTCHA HAHA
why must you make me suffer
Now that I'm gainfully employed, I can donate to AGDQ! Let's get that Bayo 2 incentive!
A very meaningful game to me personally. Enjoying the stream.
HYYYYYYPPPPPEEEEEE!
BIG Kremling ENERGY
Hello GDQ from the Silly Hat Crew. Just helping out and trying to say hi to my other friend at work who is also watching two cubicles over. ..... Honk.
@demonsmallz
10 dollars for 10 years of GDQ. Bank rolling deeply important cancer research!
Enjoying this DKC3 run! Here's 20 towards Sonic 06 and #Dixie4SmashBros
Finally made it to a GDQ in person. Putting this towards the 2006 Sonic bonus game for my buddy who is here with me and wants to see it happen. Almost there!
Drawing while watching agdq on the last day of winter break = greatness
Lost my grandmother to cancer last year. I've been following GDQ for years but never had a chance to donate.
Alright, I brushed my teeth, ate my vegetables and donated for Sonic 06!Have fun with sonic colours cyd! Looking forward to an amazing sonic block!
ITS NO USE
I'm not sure "I want to see Sonic 06" is exactly how I'd phrase it, but it's for a good cause. Good luck to all the runners!
Thank you to everyone who makes this event possible and for helping raise money for a great cause. Save the frames, kill the cancer.
Me and the missus usually watch GDQ in separate countries but actually managed to watch together this year. Happy birthday to you my smoochling and grats to GDQ for 10 years!
AGDQ is live? NOW I know the year has actually started!Good luck and few frames to all the runners!
greetings from spain, donating in sonic block because it´s the saga that defined my life (born same year) "Feliz décimo aniversario" and the honk be with you
donating for the best Sonic game, Sonic '06
Lets see that glorious dumpster fire that is Sonic 06.
Long time watcher first time donater! I love GDQ so much and am finally in a good spot to donate. Money goes to Sonic 06!
Step 1 from 4
I need Sonic '06 to happen.
It is not for us to decide whether Sonic 06 will be run. The decision was made a long time ago. We can only accept our fate.
Long-time watcher, first time donator. This event has given me life for so many years and, now that I finally can, I want to donate to support everything you guys are doing! Keep it going strong and let's get the best game of all time into this event! Can we get some Sonic 06 hype?!
I played Sonic 06, so now you all have to watch it.
My most anticipated event every year. Cannot wait to see what type of highlights we get this time. Save the frames!
Let's make Sonic '06 happen!
Step 2 of 4
Leaving 06 dollars for Sonic 06!
Give me that sweet, sweet Sonic '06 to cap off this block. Sonic is the definition of speedrunning.
Dropping this to make the Sonic '06 run happen. Let's go!
Wecome to hell, Honk!
Attention. Would the owner of a white hovercar shaped like an egg please report to the front desk -- your vehicle has been broken into. Again, would the owner of a white hovercar shaped like an egg...hey, wait a minute!
Sonic 06 HYPE!!!
GOTTA HONK FAST
Step 3 of 4
Step 4 of 4
It's 2020 my dude
I wanted to get a donation in while Lizstar was hosting. You do a lot for your little corner of the internet and we all love you! Good luck on your runs later this week! Donation goes toward your choice!
I can't count ... so there's another one :)
I totally forgot AGDQ was happening this week! Glad I checked in on you guys, so I can finally witness this event live for the first time (and give some dollars)! This is probably one of my many donations coming in this week, as my gran unfortunately died of cancer a few years back and I want to give back to the community. Let's kick some cancer butt! Lots of love from the Netherlands <3
I always love charity esport / gaming streams. They go such a long way to make esports get taken seriously AND they help a different good cause on top. Please continue doing this great work every year!
Gotta donate for Sonic block!Thanks for putting on an amazing event for a great cause
Woohoo! Awesome talk from an awesome lady. Appreciate raising awareness, as I lost my grandma to ovarian cancer early last year.
Bonsoir tout le monde ! Ceci est un petit message. Voila. Des bisous =) #DarkMageHi everyone ! This is just a little message. That it. Kiss =)
Just showing my support for talking about womens healthcare for cancer prevention! These talks are very influential for the audience and while they may be unusual now, making them a conversation that people now feel more comfortable having from being exposed to it is very important! Thank you.
Kirbymastah here. Sad I couldn't make it to AGDQ in person for the sonic block, especially to catch my one contribution to colors speedrunning by being bad at the game. I'll donate another $20 if cyd nails the asteroid coaster boss's frame perfect rocket! This donation goes to Cyd's choice. Good luck to cyd and all our fellow sonic nerds!
Happy to support this event and cause.
Combattons ensemble contre le cancer.Force et courage à tous.Et surtout bourrez les dons pour Pif le chien !#LonaLink
Hedgehog or sun dog, both are good. Good luck Cyd!
I look forward to the Sonic and Fallout speedruns every year! So happy to see my current obsession The Outer Worlds is being run as well!!! Thanks for all the hard work!
Good luck to all the Sonic Block Runners today!
Hey there AGDQ!First time ever donating!I've been a huge Sonic fan for as long as I can remember and when I came across Cyd's name on the runner list I just had to donate, I mean, we're fellow Dutchies after all! My donation also goes to the Sonic 06 run! Greetings from the Netherlands and don't forget, no copyright law in the universe is going to stop Sonic!
Can’t believe this has been going for 10 years now, all the amazing runners running 100s of amazing games is inspiring, making me have a little bit more faith in humanity. Donating during my favourite franchise of all time, thank you for 10 long years, here’s to 10 more :3
Une super semaine en prévision. On lâche rien pour la Prévention contre le cancer. Tout don est bon à prendre :) On continue aussi pour Pif, celui-là on l'aura ! #CoeurNoir
Sanic ought six!!
Thanks so much for all GDQ's work in fighting cancer and spreading the good word of speedrunning. Here's to seeing the "Bad End" of Outer Worlds!
Gotta go fast!
You got this Cyd!! gdqFAST Shoutout to my mom, who's getting a mastectomy later this month. Thanks, GDQ!
50 a day for a great agdq
Yeeeah, Sonic block!
Un don pour la recherche pour un fléau qui a fait que j'ai perdu mes 2 grands-parents maternels. J'espère que la recherche nous permettra de le vaincre! Merci aux commentateurs et à toute l'équipe du French Restream pour c'est commentaire et ce travail de qualité! Et vive Pif! #GDQup
No copyright law in the universe can stop me from going fast! Love and Chaos Emeralds from Discord HQ, let's save some lives!
Waking up at 6:30, commuting, working, commuting, cooking, eating, washing dishes. And I'm done just in time for the Sonic block! This is going to be great. Sonic is a highlight of every GDQ. Good luck to all the runners.
GOOD.. GREAT... AWESOME... OUTSTANDING... AMAZING!!! Keep up the good work, gotta go FAST!
Hey Cyd and everyone else, Sparanda here! Looking forward to the Egg Shuttle run!
IT’S MY BIRTHDAY! Guess how old I am! I can’t imagine a better way to spend my birthday than finally attending AGDQ! Let’s kick cancer’s butt! PS: I love Sonic 06! It’s so bad it’s good!
#CoeurBleu encore merci pour tous se que vous faites vous êtes géniaux

HYPE FOR $200,000! Can we see $300,000 by the end of the day? I think we can. Thank you to all the staff and volunteers at AGDQ 2020!
Shout out to SatAM!
First time watching GDQ and first time donating. Had to donate during the Sonic block, the Megadrive Sonic games are among my favorite games of all time. Looking forward to the Sonic 3 & Knuckles run. Good luck to the runners and thanks to everybody for making this possible.
Sad to see no Ristar run this time around, but hey, Lizstar is on the mic, and Sonic Colours is basically a Ristar knock-off anyway (you try telling me Cyan Laser isn't a total ripoff of the Meteor Strike) so this is close enough for my obligatory "it's wrist-star not rye-star" donation. Good luck to all the runners.
The sonic block is always my favorite! Good luck everyone!
Here's to my fellow dutchie! Je moet snel gaan!
Got to donate during the Sonic block! I've heard about how broken Colors has become, so I was very excited to see this! Good luck on the run!
Thanks to a certain untitled game, we finally know what Sonic is running from.Honk!Greetings from Germany.
Love watching AGDQ and am always happy to help
Watching here at work and letting my customers experience the magic of speed running for charity. Dont forget to go fast for Sonic and Rickey Bobby
Good luck to Cyd, and our favorite blue boy, Blue Cube wisp! Show the world how great and blue he is!
Gotta go, bro!
I always look forward to the Sonic Block at GDQ. Good luck to Cyd and all the Sonic Runners today! CatBoo
They call me Segastar so of course I have to watch the block in person. Good luck to all runners!
Hi AGDQ ! Thanks for the show and this awesome Sonic Colours run, Cyd/o/
Gotta go fast is a bit of an understatement for sonic speedruns. Gotta break fast?Good luck runners during the sonic block!
Glad for my first chance to attend AGDQ, everyone has been so wonderful! Also, 200,000 HYYYYPE!!!!!
Gotta go fast!!
Had to make my donation during a run of one of my favorite games of all time from my gaming gaming franchise. A big thank you to all the runners, commentators, crowd, donors, and behind-the-scene workers who make this event possible. I'm happy to be able to contribute to such a wonderful cause, and hope this event continues to help others for years to come.Putting this towards the Bayonetta 2 incentive; hope everyone enjoys the rest of the event, and good luck to all of the runners!
This is for Sherbear

Gotta go H O N K
Watching the Sonic block from the crowd with my partner and my brother at our first-ever AGDQ! This community is awesome! Thanks to the runners for blowing my mind with these Sonic games I love so well - best of luck and have fun! HONK!!!
Hello GDQ. Long time watcher, first time donor. Thank you to all people involved in these events. My grandfather lost his battle with cancer this past september after 7 years, so this donation is dedicated to his memory. Hopefully we will soon be able to speedrun cancer treatment to the point where people will not need to fight cancer in their 80s like grandpa did.
Great to see a fellow Dutchman at GDQ (there's no mistaking that accent), and playing my favorite Sonic game too! Best of luck to CriticalCyd, and greetings from Groningen.
I'm the Knight of the Wind
Had to donate during Sonic Colors run since it was the first sonic game I ever played.
Thank you to all the runners for supporting such an amazing cause!
Really looking forward to Fallout Anthology, The Outer Worlds, and all the DOOM games! Good luck to all of the runners and a huge thanks to everyone involved, this year is shaping up to be amazing as always. Can I get a HYPE! from the audience?
My own mother is a cancer survivor, and my mother-in-law is currently suffering from the disease herself. Thank you so much to the runners, organizers, and Prevent Cancer Foundation for making this event happen. It's always a highlight of my year, and it means a lot to have the community come together for a great cause.
GOTTA GO... HONKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!

Another year, another Sonic block. Gotta donate fast!
Bonne chance aux runners et bon courage aux commentateurs ! #EniCeleste
Never seen a Sonic Colors run before, but this is looking pretty impressive! This was the first Sonic game I ever played, so it's cool to see this from a new perspective. The only bad part about zooming through these levels so fast is that we miss out on getting to listen to this awesome soundtrack.Best of luck to all the runners! Put this towards runner's choice.
This Sonic Colours run is incredible. I am in utter awe at Sonic in his element! Can't wait to see the rest of the Sonic block.
The mighty ocean! Cradle of life! Trivialized for your amusement at Eggman’s Incredible Interstellar Amusement Park.
We know they look delicious, but please refrain from licking the rides. That would be disgusting. Do you know where those rides have been? People have been sitting on those rides. With their BUTTS! Okay, go ahead. Lick them. Don’t say we didn’t warn you.
Petit fail sur l'incentive, cette fois je me loupe pas. x) L'insomnie déjà commencer pour moi. Et c'est que le début !
You mean I can add an incentive towards a FF8 song played live on stream... Yes Please! Chat is cute <3
I won't be able to watch the DOOM run tonight, but wanted to make sure I donated! For Bloodlust on Kromcrush!
The GDQ marathons are one of my favorite events in the year, thank you for all you guys do to raise money for charity!
This is for my friend Danielle, who beat non-hodgkin's lymphoma and just hit her 5 year mark for being cancer free. Donating during Sonic block in honor of all the sonic we played together!
First time donator! just wanted to donate during my favorite speedrun of sonic colors
Hello from the front row! This is my first time attending a GDQ in person and I can tell you folks at home, the hype is AMPLIFIED here. Your screen does not do this any justice. Glad to have made the trip from Canada to see friends, runners... and the Dancing Dad up front!Money goes the Punch-Out blindfold run. From the sound of it, it shall be awesomeHONK!
It is, in fact, of some use!
So happy it is time for AGDQ again! Had to donate in the Sonic block because this was the first video game series I got into as a kid. Gotta go fast!
gamers game games game games gamers
I'm not quick enough to come up with any puns. I don't have the hedgehog's sharp wit.
I'm donating in honor of my nephew, Aiden, who has been fighting cancer for 3 years. He loves Puyo Puyo and Sonic the Hedgehog (and even just got a "Sanic" t-shirt), and he delights all the hospital staff with his cute stuffed animals, I Spy clues, and donations of video games for other sick kids. I know that he doesn't want anyone else to go through a fight like his, so I'm donating to help stop cancer before it starts. Gotta beat cancer fast! Much love to you all, GDQ. It would make my nephew so happy if the crowd would say, "Go Aiden!"
Frame Perfect Tricks? I got the other 20$ to make it 40$ if CYD makes it!
Keeping with my New Year Resolution of trying to put a little bit of money towards a good cause.
malgrug will donate in the name of his guild Bloodlust. we speedrun ragnaros every week and we will speedrun a cur for cancer as well.
It's no use! Take this money!
Extremely excited to watch TomatoAngus breeze through the Fallout Anthology at AGDQ2020. Honk
Someone hug cyd instead of me. Who am I? I am thebluemania.
#GDQupIl manquait pas grand chose ! Gardez la pèche et la tête de l'incentive !
The Sonic Colors soundtrack always cheers me up when I'm feeling down. Keep going fast and wishing everyone a great 2020! <3
This is my first time donating to a GDQ event! All these “honks” going on throughout the marathon are really reminding me of Homestuck. Did you know there’s a Homestuck 2 now? Anyways, I’m loving all these runs and want to say good luck to all the runners!
First time attending great to see these runs in person.
So bizarre hearing Liz commentate SNES runs. That's the wrong side of the console war! Thankfully, it's Sonic block now, and all is right with the world.
 (Comment rejected)
Excellent Colours run, glad to see this underrated gem get time in the spotlight! Putting this towards naming the Wingull " Bees?" because BEEEEES.
Hello! First time donating, been watching since 2018. I love this event, and now that I have a few savings, I had to donate during the Sonic block, I love Sonic games (Specially the classic ones) since I was a kid <3 Good luck to all the runners! Greetings from Spain :D
Sonic. Block. HYPE!!
Let's K.O. cancer with this Punch-Out run!
Loving the Sonic block, keep up the good work! Don’t forget, you gotta...go...something.
Hey Sonikku, this one's for you. We're all cheering for you in the audience, and I'm so excited you're getting to show your stuff at GDQ. Much luck and love. YOSH!
Recent watcher and recent donator! Been watching since a saw a few runs with friends during AGDQ2019, and now I'm watching the whole thing since the last SGDQ!Nominating Bard for Squall's name in the FFVIII run in honour of my favourite game of all time, Wandersong. In the meantime, I hope you all enjoy the Sonic block!
Such a wonderful event!
Hello from New Zealand - I woke up early for the Sonic block! I was diagnosed with a non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in 2019, so this year's GDQ is closer to my heart than ever. Lots of love to everyone in the industry whose lives have been changed by these diseases. Hey Sega, new Chao Garden when?
Donating for my favorite pair of nerds. Cyd, don't die... again.
"I WANNA GO FAST!!" -RICKY BOBBY
First time donator here. Sonic Colours was one of the first games I got on the Wii and I remember having a blast with it, so it's great to see it here at GDQ!I'll double my donation if the couch does the Final Colour Blaster chant for the final hit of the Egg Nega Wisp Armour.

First things first:If this gets read out loud during the Celeste run, i will donate another 25$.Important things last:Hi AGDQ, long time watcher, first time donator! I wanted to say thank you to all the amazing people who made these events possible! Please stay as amazing as you are! Also i wanted to give a shoutout to all the awesome girls and boys from LPIP! May the peppermint be with you! Good luck to all the runners and donation goes to runners choice :)
Keep up the good runs and side with Phineas! Want to see Tartarus speed run!
Love this game! My best friend was fortunate enough to beat cancer at the age of eight years old, but this donation goes out to all the people who weren't so lucky. Let's kick cancer's butt!!
greetings from spain, the dr. robotnik in the crowd get up and say "HONK"
This is my first time watching GDQ live even though I've watched VODs for years. Cheers to this great run and my favorite video game character as a kid. Let's beat cancer.
Gros soutien et courage à tout ceux qui se battent contre cette maladie ! #GDQup
I met my oldest friend through being Sonic fans way back in 2002. Her mother passed away from cancer in 2019. I'm pretty she's watching the Sonic block at work, so hey: love you, Jeni.
I've been watching Games Done Quick for years, but never had the money to donate. Now that I do, I wanted to donate during the Sonic block, because Sonic has a special place in my heart for being the first game I ever played. So many good memories. Thank you guys for doing what you do, let's stick it to cancer. Money goes to Punch Out 2p1c blindfolded bonus game, the more GDQ the better!
Hey there, I just had to drop a donation in for the run of my favourite Mega Drive-era Sonic game! Proud of all the work you're doing to prevent cancer, given my dad was diagnosed a few years back and was successfully treated for it. Keep up the great work, and I might see if I can spare a little more either during the Pokémon Sapphire run, or if you go for a Good Future!
We need punch out! Instead of joining the Nintendo fun club, I'll put my money to helping fight cancer!
Shout out to the dancing peeps in the audience, keep it groovin!
HONK
I love me some Sanic the Hotdog!

There's nothing like GDQ to help Mondays go by a little bit faster!
My grandfather passed from lung cancer a few years ago, so along with my appreciation of speedrunning and retro games, I am very happy to donate today. Keep doing what you're doing!
Have to donate during my favorite Block. Sonic was a inspiration during my childhood and has continued to be 'Way Past Cool.'
Let’s go Sornic
Had to donate in honor of those awesome Sonic 3D Blast tunes. Thanks for keeping me entertained at work!
gosh i cant believe i finally caught a GDQ! of course i have to donate at least a bit since i FINALLY caught it, so JP soundtrack for Sonic CD it is! thank you for all you do!

Zapp and Sun for outer worlds

How could I not donate during sonic block?! Favourite game for the last three decades!! Good luck to all the runners, you guys are awesome!
sonic 06 was my introduction to GDQ. glad to see it again.
My mom is a two time cancer survivor and introduced me to games with Sonic. Would be a shame not to donate! My money goes to the scary US sonic CD boss music.
Gotta go fast! Thanks so much to all the runners, support personnel, and everyone involved for putting on my favorite gaming event of the year. Let's beat cancer together!
8ème année que je regarde et premier don pour cette 10ème année !Bravo tout le monde !
First time donation but we lost a good colleague to cancer two days ago...! I just had to donate. Thank you all so much for doing something against this terrible sickness!
Just a quick anti-snipe measure for Sonic CD ;)
Bonne AGDQ à tous! Merci aux commentateurs/ambianceurs.Go Pif! #MarioLight
Unite, Game and lets defeat cancer. :D
That throw pillow is too excellent to not donate. Good luck to all the runners!
why no love for US soundtrack?
Legally Distinct Blue Donation
Donation + Donation = good help,,,, quick math ting skrrra
One month ago we got the horrible news that my mom has lung cancer. Her condition went down incredibly fast and she passed away less than 3 weeks later on December 21st. She was only 58 years old. Nobody deserves this. I am grateful for everything AGDQ does for Prevent Cancer. Sonic the Hedgehog was my entire childhood and my mom would always get me everything Sonic related I wanted. She was a great mother and it's thanks to her that I am the way I am now. Good luck to everyone at AGDQ and especially those who are playing the blue blur's games :)
I really want that fast rodent pillow. I need it in my life.
Gotta go fast
no comment here
Hey gang, it's the CEO of Sonic CD here. Good luck on the run and let's destroy cancer. Did you know that in an early prototype build of Sonic CD Palmtree Panic was named Salad Plain
Good games for a good cause. This comes with love from your friends at AJRPG.
IT'SNOUSE! GREATGREATGREAT! The JP OST in CD is superior so my donation goes to that! Go fast, my friends.
Hey guys wish I could have been there to see you all race live but I'm excited to meet up with you guys when I get there tomorrow! I'd donate to the JP OST incentive, but it looks like more then enough people have donated to the better choice anyways so I'll just put my 10.00 to naming Wingull in Pokemon Saphirre 10.00. From one CD runner to another, good luck to all of you~
First donation of the event. Can't wait to see the 100% Doom 2016 run! Thanks to everyone involved.
DE/GER Good Sonic Speed-Run! Thanks for that.For the german Stream:Ihr brennt ein Feuerwehr ab. Weiter so!! :D
Greeting from the crowd! It's my first GDQ event in person. Sonic makes for great speedruns because it doesn't get much better than going fast while trying to go fast.
I need that fast blue rodent throw pillow. i NEED it
Hey finalflame, your old friend Ben here. Just want to advise you while you play Sonic CD to avoid going into a *Tails* spin.
Always great to watch some games be completely broken for our speedrunning needs. Good luck to all the runners and WOO charity!
As a SEGA Employee I have to donate, like every GDQ, during the sonic block.
Salut à toute l'équipe et aux visionneurs. Bon courage, et mettons plein de noms pertinents et originaux pour les défis. #GDQup
GIVE ME THAT PILLOW!
Been watching you guys for years and I gotta say it's been amazing so far watching everyone grow and become such a loving and caring community! Here's to 10 years and 10 years more fam! Money goes to runners choice!

Cancer bad. Games good. Going fast better.
Hello from the UK! First time donating and watching GDQ properly. I'm a nurse and see people suffering with cancer daily, so this GDQ is close to my heart.
I NEED that generic blue rodent pillow. My life depends on it. Don't ask why.
The Sonic block is always my favorite! I hope all our runners are able to "Knuckles" down and go fast to get those rings to cancel cancer. Thanks to all the staff who help out! It wouldn't be the same without you!
AQDQ, Is here again providing a week packed with quality Entertainment.Thanks to the Staff and Runners.
Campus Cards and Games here - we're a local hobby shop in Orlando! We always look forward to watching these events, and are excited to live stream the event all week in-store.Thanks so much for everything you do, and IT'S NO USE!(If you're able to read this during the Sonic '06 event, we'd be thrilled <3)
So hyped for the Fallout Anthology!

My second GDQ, and my first AGDQ. This is my first donation of the event, but hopefully won't be my last. Super onboard for that Sonic 06 HYPE
Sonic: He can really move! Sonic: He's got an attitude! Sonic: He's the fastest thing alive! Or he would be, if not for all of these amazing speedrunners! Here's to leaving cancer in the dust!
I've never donated with a prize in mind before, but that pillow is just way too good to miss. Gotta go fa--I mean, gotta go at a totally normal hedgehog speed!
Been watching the VODs for a while, but this is one of the first times I’ve caught the streams live and can donate so had to do so in the Sonic block for the best broken game I (sadly) grew up with - It’s no use!
First time donating and of course its for my favorite blue boy. Excited for the rest of the block. Lets go fast!
Good luck to Flying_Fox in the sonic CD run!
It's almost harvesting season!
Shoutouts to the music mix between games and whoever compiled it, great tunes year after year!
These donations are going at sonic speeds!
Cybernetic ranger is a game
OMG i want that Sonic pillow !!!
This is for my brother, who beat heart cancer in 2011, my username is an homage to his, which was Bulbasaurus Rex.
I am a long time watcher of GDQ but this is a particularly poignant year as I was diagnosed with malignant melanoma in February 2019 and am still being treated for it.I just wanted to say how inspired I am by the speed running community and for the human endeavour you all display. Thanks also to the doctors and scientists who are making it possible to defeat cancer.
Sonic Block, then Fallout and Outer Worlds? Well, good thing I had no plans.
Donating to help a good cause and in the hope of winning the Obviously Legally Distinct Blue Hedgehog Throw Pillow.
Big thanks to everyone who helps put on such and awesome event for a good cause, good luck to all the runners!
A part of my family had to suffer from cancer and some lost the fight. This donation shall help to get rid of this terrible disease.
I'm so happy that I'm able to donate to GDQ this year! You guys are doing great things. Good luck to all the runners! And thank you microphone man for reading donations!

Laid up sick on the couch for the last 4 days... at least it happened after Christmas break and during a GDQ live event. My first time watching live and donating, what you guys do is simply amazing – it's like the Olympics of gaming but instead of awarding medals, you're saving lives. Shout out to the stellar crew behind the scenes, the audience, and all the awesome speedrunners. HYPE!!!
How much hedge could a hedgehog hedge if a hedgehog could hedge fast?
Join us. Embrace your inner Dance. Dance Dad is Legion.
Nobody's sniping the Sonic CD music bid on my watch! Japanese soundtrack, please!
Sonic 06 was one of the first runs I ever saw back during SGDQ 2016, so I had to donate for that. Also I NEED THAT YOSHI COIN
Long time watcher, First time donating. Love fallout and sonic. My two grandfathers passed away from cancer. so let's go fast and beat cancer. Honk
Bucket Hype!
I always watch the Sonic block while I'm at work on the official Sonic comic books, thanks for another year and good luck everyone!
I agree with the earlier donation: bring back the Chao Garden.

Best of luck to all the Sonic CD Runners. May Tail's flight be high and may Wacky *Boop* Bench work in your favor. Espescially WW3. Shoutouts to the Sonic Speedrun Community.
Hey AGDQ! Just thanking everyone for participating in such a wonderful event for a great cause. You're doing a fantastic job. Especially you, Lizstar! Donation goes to JP Soundtrack for Sonic CD because I can't let you apply it to the US Soundtrack.

Shout out to the "unofficial, official AGDQ dancers" in the front row! Y'all make me smile between every run. I'm so glad you made it to Orlando! Can I get a "unofficial, official AGDQ dancers" HYPE train going? $5 per dancer! Choo Choo!!!

Donating while Lizstar is on the mic, Amber is on the couch, and flying fox is on stream. Greetings from the Frame Fatales discord!Yeah... That's all I got. My money's on fox, so donation goes to her choice.
Greetings esteemed guests. I am enjoying this Sonic block a lot, and look forward to seeing Sonic 06. Since Eggman is going to be defeated a lot, let him decide where this money goes. Keep on grooving all.
Gotta keep the meme going and add ARBYS as an option to every name bid that's currently up
Thanks for introducing me to these so-called 'video games'. I'll be checking them out for sure!
Had to donate during the Sonic Block to honor one of my favorite video game characters, and my mom who got me my Sega Genesis to get my into Sonic. Here’s to the game that made me want a Sega CD!
Hey GDQ, long time memer first time spammer! Had to donate during my least favorite game, Sonic CD 201! It feels great to watch FinalFlame, FlyingFox and Sonikkustar totally destroy this awful run! I’ll donate an extra 5$ if everyone on the couch says CD93 is better! Greetings from England!
Lonnie is the best.
My first game was Sonic 2 on the Megadrive.. erhm Genesis, so of course I had to donate for this block!
For my sister. We miss you
Cancer's affected everyone I know. Thank you all for doing what you do. Gotta go honk!
Lost my grandmother to breast cancer a few years ago. Looking forward to the day that no one has to experience that ever again. GDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation are great organizations for working towards that, as well!
VRISKA
Hey all! Sonic CD is one of my favorite 2D Sonic's; 2nd time seeing a run of this and so far it's looking incredible. Shoutouts to the couch commentary and the Sonic Soeedrunning community!
Love the Sonic block. Friend of mine had cancer last year so the money couldn't go to a better cause! Lets get Kyogre nicknamed Magikarp!
Griffin McElroy, if you can hear me, donate to name winggull after your beautiful child, sea breeze.
Keep up the good work AGSQ !!!
I've played all of the Sonic games except Unleashed, Colors, and '06; CD is still my favorite! I'm glad it's not on the .... TAILS end of the block, or I may have missed it.
My wife surprised me with the trip down here to AGDQ and we are sitting in the crowd. Let’s beat cancer!!
Who is this Eggman you speak of? Is he one of Dr. Robotnik's henchmen?
Vriska did nothing wrong.
Toujours un bonheur de suivre cet événement et de contribuer à cette cause ! Merci à tous !!! #CoeurBleu
A shoutouts to everybody working behind the scenes to keep everything up and running! Thank you all so much!
Been watching AGDQ since summer 2015, first time donating. Always amazing to see these events and the communities behind them come together to support such a great cause. Game on, my dudes. And don't forget: HONK!
Good luck, runners! Gotta go fast! 🦊

"Eyes On Me" always makes me cry.Make me cry, GDQ.
i love sonic, i grew up watching my big brother play these games until i was big enough to play them myself. now i always get nostalgic when listening to the soundtrack or playing one of these games. thank you for this great event, it always is so much fun to watch!
Its always a lot of fun watching you guys and hearing you talk about the games. Thanks for hosting!
5 dollar today again for the 5 dollar train...choo choo!
What does the fox say? HONK.
Hey all, my grandpa got diagnosed with cancer last year and it's breaking my entire family apart since he doesn't have much time left. I was jobless for months and just got hired at a new place, so I don't have much to donate. This is my first time donating after watching for 4 years and I had to do it during the sonic block because I LOVE sonic. Thanks for everything GDQ does and for everyone who donates. Donate fast, run fast!
Zap to the extreme!
Prizes?
Save the animals, you monsters! Also, HONK
Loving the Sonic runs. Thought I would put my money towards Pokémon being dominated by DIO. Let Dio help prevent cancer!
Hey everyone, sorry I couldn't be there to hang out and help commentate. Real life sucks sometimes. Shoutouts to void, cyd and the CD gang for some excellent runs today (and amber for holding down CD commentary). Hopefully S3K treats zax and joey better than it treats me when I run it. I'll be running along at home, so we'll see how many times I get destroyed by the game...
must go at an above average speed. Sonic 06 HYPE
Pour la postérité
You guys are da best. Keep up the awesome work! And remember, I before E, except after HONK!
Great race on Sonic CD! Looking forward to the Mega Man relay race later this week!
Wow! My first AGDQ donation and here I am donating to name Rinoa from Final Fantasy VIII Vriska. What a time to be alive. Anyways Im glad to be able to donate to this awesome cause. I love AGDQ so much and I wish the best of luck to all of the runners!

Loving the Sonic Block! Remember you gotta go fast, move quickly, make haste, accelerate at high velocity, generously progress at an appropriate speed relative to the situation, and ...um... just.... just run.
it is my birthday so i am feeling generous
Vous éte beau !
Hey GDQ! Chrezm here! Amazing Sonic block so far, can't wait to see my boys joey and zaxon kill Sonic 3 & Knuckles. These two have pushed this game beyond anything anyone could have imagined in the past year, and their constant dedication to proving the impossible possible shows here. I can say for everyone in the Sonic 3 & Knuckles community that this will be an amazing race. May everything go... AsIntended!
SANIC
Bonne année et bonne GDQ à tous ʕ •ᴥ• ʔ
Samus's power armor is the best power armor.
So excited for the Sonic 3 & Knuckles run as I played this game a lot as a kid. My grandpa passed away from cancer this last February and I’m hoping we can see cancer put to rest and see great people like my grandpa was be cured from this terrible disease

Awesome event and awesome runs. Keep the good work and OOOOOOORB
Greetings from England. Unable to watch AGDQ at the moment due to being stuck at work but am looking forward to watching back the Sonic block when I get home. Sonic HYPE
The thing that always baffles me about AGDQ is how you can all wear shorts in January! It's freezing where I am!Have a good one, everybody!
S3&K was my jam back in the day, I'm thrilled to see what's in store for it!
Gotta donate fast!Puns aside, I really had to donate durning the FASTEST block of AGDQ. You people make it look so easy, awesome work!
5 bucks for GDQ Dance dad and crew. You guys rock!
Adding $10 to the Dancers hype train!
Why do we not hear ORB anymore? Because someone honked it.
Let's be excellent to each other!
Go DOOOOOMGo BUCKETHEAD
In loving memory of my grandmother, taken by cancer 20ish years ago. The original Sonic the Hedgehog was her favorite game and she'd be proud of what th series was helping to accomplish.
Cancer can suck it!
I lost my mom to brain cancer a week ago, so what you're doing, raising money for such a good cause, and having (and providing) fun while doing it, means a lot. Keep on the good work!
Enter Comment Here
Don’t think! Don’t blink! Just go go go go gogogogogogo! Putting my donation for the next bonus game.
Just a small donation to say Happy Birthday to my husband. No better way to celebrate than with AGDQ!
Danny Kroese i know youre watching this time to donate friend, greetings from holland
Honk if you’ve got hype!
This Sonic block has been pretty great thus far, although... Sonic '06, all things considered... well, no matter. Best of luck on the runs. Let's see Super Castlevania IV Hard Mode get met.
I'm loving all the dancing in the audience this year. What a great way to celebrate 10 years of good games and good deeds for charity. Honk!
It's hammer time!

Bonjour Aelthan comment vas-tu ? #GDQup
First time watching live, but have followed gdq for a few years. So, retroactive donation unlocked. Love everything about this event! Cheers from Hamburg Germany.
Cancer researcher and Sonic superfan here! I'm home from work all week due to surgery, so thanks for keeping cancer in check while I'm out of the office! Go fast, don't for, & Knuckles!
My Dad got me a genesis for my 4th birthday, and playing it (especially the classic Sonic games) became part of my childhood. My stepmom just got diagnosed with breast cancer, so here’s to her, GDQ, and the PCF.
I just want to do a shout out to my boy Bruce who inspired me to be a part of the Sonic Speed Run community and made this donation possible. Can I get a honk?
hey zaxon and joey!doesn't it feel SUPER to be racing at AGDQ? just think, both of your TAILS of running s3k led to this point.can't wait to watch this CHAOS of a race. much love to you both and all the runners at the event. you all are so amazing.
Pourquoi la proposition sur Fallout n'a pas été acceptée et c'est encore Honk en tête ? XD #DarkMage
#LonaLink Je ne peu jamais donner je suis votre stream depuis des années un grand merci à votre équipe chaque jour qui passe c'est des heures de sommeil en moins.
Hey all! Long time watcher, first time donator. Wasn't sure if I could donate, but then I found out I got accepted to job today! So I thought, why not? This money goes to the sun ending of the outer worlds, cause we all know that it's the Zapp Branigan ending.
I think the front row is playing secretly Just Dance...
Hey Rockruff Hat and Dance Dad, I see you there in the audience and wish I were there partying with you guys like last year. Thanks for keeping the party going!

Heard about Eggman and that convinced me to come watch for a while. Big ups to you, dude.
Having lost both my grandads to cancer before I was ever able to meet them, I love all the work that the marathon does every year! Wish I could afford to donate more, this small amount goes to announcer's choice
Did i hear 10$ dancers hype train
I woke up early to catch some of the runs before school and when I come back from school Lizstar is still commentating. Hope you sleep well when you can.
"Bonjour" from France, first time I can give to GDQ, and I'm happy to do it. Happy 10th birthday to all the GDQ community.
Shoutout to nicuveo, and foophoof who might be somewhere in the A/V crew.
I want that pillow.
Had to donate for the Best Blue Boy during Sonic block. Thank you to all the runners, crew, volunteers, and everyone involved in putting on this event. Gotta go fast!
Toss a ring to the hedgehog, oh valley of green hills...
Go runners go!
Greetings from Germany. Seeing what theese runners are capable of always amazes me. My grandfather passed away from cancer, let's help eradicate this disease and watch some great speedruns in the process.
I just can't get enough of fallout anthology runs. I also better make sure we get the true ending in Outer Worlds. Praise the sun.
Hey everyone! Ever since my mother got cured from cancer, I decided to do my best to help as many people as possible get cured too. GDQ is just the perfect occasion for that! Thanks a lot to everyone who is working very hard to make GDQ happen and happy 10th anniversary!Also, shout out to the person on the first row with the Scorbunny hat. I NEED that hat!HOOOOOOOOONK!

Long time viewer, first time donator. Love this event every year. Super excited to catch and donate during my favorite Sonic game! This donation goes out in memory of my boss's wife who just lost her battle with cancer. Good luck to all the runners. And thanks to all the people who make this event possible. Hoping to make it out next year! And remember Don't forget to be Awesome!
GDQ is my favorite time of the year! Here's to another 10 amazing years of speedruns and charity!

Gonna donate during Sonic Block cuz Sonic was the first game I played. Gotta donate fast and beat cancer!
Here are some rings to egg on the AGDQ, The Awesome Grooving Dance-Qrew.Also shoutout to Brickroad who's chilling somewhere in the audience.
Still mad that Tails is left off of the title card for this one. Why not Sonic 3 & Knuckles & Tails ?
Kill the animals and save Knuckles!
Keep up the great work!
This is in memory of my father, who we lost to cancer over ten years ago now. He bought me my first console (a Sega Genesis) and got me started gaming. My fondest gaming memory is when he let me stay up late, on a school night even, because I cleared Metropolis zone in Sonic 2 for the first time. So I had to donate during the Sonic block.
I've watched you guys for years. Love what you do for the different charities.
Finally donating to such a great cause, gotta rep my gal Vriska for FFVIII
Hey all! Had to donate for one of my favourite games, Sonic 3 and Knuckles! Good luck to Zaxon and Joey, and shoutouts to the amazing couch of Drakodan, Spike and Supersonic! Cheers!
Win for Violet Moon and vir kid Kat! We love them!
gl joey and zax
Good evening GDQ. My European time difference makes it tough to follow everything live. But great Sonic block. Keep going fast!
Finally its this time of the year again. Good luck to all runners.
Gotta donate during best game of best franchise! Glad my favorite stage ever, Angel Island, somehow remains untainted by glitches. Honk!
Trans rights
Wait, why is Knuckles blue in this game? Good luck Joey and Zaxon!
ANYWAY, STAN VRISKA
Always donate during the Sonic Block. Love the way the runners go fast. Keep it up!
There's an urgency I feel when watching Sonic I can't quite articulate. We need to move ahead with extreme alacrity.We must advance with suitable forward momentum! Feet must raise and lower with great rapidity.We must swiftly travel with promptness and haste!The expeditiousness in which we reach our maximum velocity will further our efforts to reach an immediate in conclusion!Sigh, I wish there was an easier way to say it.
Whoever made the sonic pillow is a god!Gotta go HOOOOONK!
Thanks for all you do! Here's $10 for Sonic to glitch through those frames.
Hello AGDQ. I've been watching GDQ since 2017 and it's all thanks to the man in the hot seat right now. Here's a $75 donation in Joey's name to help the cause even further. Good luck to everyone and give this race a run for it's money.

Supporting a great cause here, lost my dad to cancer last year. Thank you to all the runners and organizers. Much love from Denmark
Hi, Clov here! I've been enjoying the Sonic block so far. Keep going fast and don't forget Knuckles is watching :eyes:P.S.: AsIntended
Sonic and Knuckles was my favorite game growing up and still holds a special place in my heart. Maybe one of these days, we'll actually see a run that uses Knuckles instead of Sonic or Tails... <.<
This speedrun is so impressive and so wild! Both runners are doing amazing jobs! Love, from the crowd
Honking geese are getting all the attention this year, but don't forget that ducks also love Games Done Quack.
Hello! I've never donated before, but I'm a big Sonic fan and so I have to contribute during the Sonic 3 and Knuckles run, which was probably the greatest game of my childhood! Read the Sonic IDE comics!
Big fan of Sonic 3 & Knuckles. You guys are blowing my mind with these glitches! THIS IS AWESOME!

Let's get those millions together, hey?
All this high speed warping..... could this be.... CHAOS CONTROL!?!
Love AGDQ watch it every year. CAN WE GET SOME HYPE FOR ZAXON96 HYPE IF we do will donate another 5 dollars :D GO ZAXON GO
:)
first time donating long time watcher, gl runners :D
Goodluck to FocusSight on his Sonic '06 run! Glad I could tune in from Australia!
Greetings from the 4th row. Today is my best friend's birthday! Guess how old she is? I'm so glad to be attending GDQ for the first time, and glad she could be here with me. Even though, much to my chagrin, she is super excitedly dragging me along to the Sonic '06 run (she loves that game). Let's go fast, and kick Cancer's butt!
Compelled to progress expeditiously
Had to donate during one of my favourite Sonic Games to play. What? Sonic was actually the good guy? OHNO!
Tryin out a new name. What do ya think?
Can I offer you a nice Eggman in this trying time?
IT'S NO USE! TAKE THIS (donation)! Having a blast tuning in this year, and I'm happy to see this beautiful mess of a game on the AGDQ stage. Best of luck to the runner!
Donating ahead of the Fallout speedrun. Good luck, Tomatoangus! Also, rainforest Cafe, if you're watching/listening, I only went to your restaurant because of tomatoangus' rave reviews and constant free advertising, rainforest Cafe marketing department, SPONSOR HIM! Thanks!
Come on Zaxon you got this donk boy!
Bonsoir à tous, que les dons et les belles runs continuent. #PokeLou
Frog Gang
Sonic is so fast wow
And I thought Sonic '06 was broken. Put this towards Joey's choice.
Thank you to all the speedrunners, you're all amazing! S3&K still holds fond memories of my childhood and I remember laughably attempting to "speedrun" this series. Looking forward to Sonic 06 and let's help fight stop cancer!
Didn't expect Sonic to be commentated by a Brit and Tom Hanks. Have a chili dog on me for cancer prevention.
Hey just watching with my soon to be wife!Jessica will you Marry Me??
Here's $10 towards a great cause. I lost my mom to cancer almost 4 years ago and it's time for cancer to get rekt! I hope all the players are having fun and that their runs go well!
Fun fact: "Sonic hedgehog" is the name of an actual human protein, encoded by the "S.H.H." gene, study of which is an active topic in cancer research. Here's hoping our hero can help progress on a cure *go fast*! Thanks to the runners and announcer for such awesome gameplay and commentary.
I love hot dogs.

I finished Outer World last weekend in preparation to watch it be completely broken today at GDQ! Shoutout to my boyfriend Jack, who introduced me to GDQ years ago. This event and everyone involved is absolutely amazing, and I'm proud to watch and donate every year.
first time donating and first time watching live after hours of watching old gdq's on youtube! much love to all the runners
fst
Let's Go!!!
with love to Glitches-are-cool ❤️
There is only one word to sum up this fantastic event. And it is HONK!
Hey Focus, it's your trunky friend here reminding you to turn off subtitles and voice clips so the game loads quicker! KappaShout-outs to ZZZjpn, here's hoping we can get Unleashed any% at a GDQ at some point
Five years ago, I was preparing to start radiation and chemotherapy. Today, I am cancer free! Thank you to everyone at GDQ for your hard work. I'm so excited for this Sonic 06 run!
Thank you! <3
It's no use!
GOTTA GO QUICK
GDQs are the highlight of my year, and this one is already off to a great start.
In the spirit of the new Sonic movie, how much to get Gangster’s Paradise on repeat throughout the entire Sonic 06 run?
(Yell this please, Liz <3)TRASH FOR THE TRASH GODJUNK FOR THE JUNK THRONE
Greetings from Germany. Thanks for those Sonic runs they are amazing!And i want some WOOOOOOH from the crowd
My mother was just diagnosed with cancer 7 weeks ago, thankfully her treatments have been going well and things are looking good, just doing my share to help so others don't have to deal with cancer
I'm not Awesome Games Done Quick; I'm my original marathon, Blawesome Games Done Quick.
Great games, great cause! Thank you to all that have made this possible year after year!
Me like hedgehog lots. He go fast and he funny.
Dancing Dad, move back to the middle seat, we need you in the spotlight! Don't get pushed off your stage! If I could ever have another dad, it would be you, ya dang handsome dancing man!
Been following GDQ for almost 3 years now and i loved it every time! Big up from Italy!
In honor of Rush being a Good Boy for PJ put this towards PUNCHOUT CO-OP since that was clearly blind luck (the best kind).
I lost my father to cancer last year. The first console my father gave me was the sega genesis with the Sonic games that me and brother played and loved. He would always just sit beside us and enjoy watching us play. He got us both into the joy of gaming and consequently helped me get my future job. The pain of losing my dad still hurts greatly, and I hope the cure for cancer gets found soon so nobody has to go through the same pain I did. Much love to you all.
Day 2! I already don't want the event to end. That was a awesome sonic we witnessed. Can't wait for OuterWorlds later!
i did this for you vriska
Donating in honor of Zax! The subpixels might've done you dirty in front of your squad, but we still have your back. Thanks so much for running for all of us here at home! Donation goes to Zaxon's choice.
To help put an end so the day comes nobody suffers from this again.
I'm sorryDonation goes to runner's choice.
Thanks for everything GDQ does, Sonic is one of my son's favorites and we can't wait to join you all in Orlando later in the week. Gotta go fast!
Best event.
Un grand merci pour votre stream, sincèrement.
That blue rodent pillow is the best thing ever!

Hi
Hey Focus Buddy! Your friend Mister Monki here! I told ya you'd be running this today and I know you're gonna do great!Also, I head that Trial Skip had something like 50 frame perfect inputs from your interview, so here's $50! If you pull it off I'll donate another $50!Good Luck!
Sonic 06 was the first Sonic game my friends deigned to introduce me to. Can I get an F from the audience please
Just donating $1 for every time I heard "IT'S NO USE!" when I played Sonic '06 to completion back in 2018. High fives to the runners, commentators, announcers, and everyone in attendance, and thank you SO MUCH for all you do!
IT'S NO GOOSE!!
Sonic the Hedgehog was a massive part of my childhood and so I absolutely had to donate during the Sonic Block, especially during a Sonic 06 speedrun! It amazes me how much more this game can be broken than it already is!
Run all the things
“Ha ha! One!” Donating for the Sonic 06 run, but my donation goes to the Griever incentive for Final Fantasy 8.Let’s name him a name that truly strikes fear into the hearts of millions.Goose. HONK!
I'm not crazy about the hairstyle, and his fur looks more grey than blue, but at least he looks more like Sonic than he did in the first trailer...
Hey everyone, thanks so much for another fantastic AGDQ! Safe to say my productivity at work is basically null this week. But I love to support such a great cause, and looking forward to even more thrilling speedruns throughout the week! HONK!
Skeebledorp is friend, hello.
Sitting here with my wife and our two toddlers watching the runs. Took vacation for the week so we can enjoy as many runs as possible. Hopefully the little ones grow up loving this awesome event and join us in on our tradition of watching every GDQ we can. HONK HYPE
Looking forward to the Sonic 06 run and to watch my favorite runner, good old TomatoAngus, run my favorite anthology. Honk!
Good luck to Tomatoangus on the Fallout Anthology! With the power of your stand, BIG IRON, nothing can defeat you!
I will never forget Tripleagent's [sonic voice]"OKAY! OKAY! This game is OKAY!" from his run a few years ago. Still cracks me up. Good luck to Focussight dealing with Silver; you're a really useful hedgehog! :)
Incredible to be able to see this Fallout series marathon. Thumbs up for the speedrunner and his couch.
I am honored to donate during the run of Sonic 06, a game none of us will ever forget. I can't get Sonic's voice out of my head when he screams, "Elise!!". Also....hey
A good friend of mine died t recently from brain cancer, so this event hits harder than ever. This is for him and a thanks for everyone involved in this great cause. Also, honk.
I'm incredibly lucky in that my father has survived multiple cancer scares, the most recent of which came last year. However, I know there are many people and families out there who aren't so lucky. I'm giving what I can to ensure the dream of a cancer-free world becomes a reality. Good luck to all the runners, you are all far more skilled at video games than I ever could be.
For my Uncle Bubba
My dad died from pancreas cancer about five years ago, at the age of 64. It’s such a hideous disease that affect so many of us. I love it that you guys are doing What you do, putting out a-class entertainment and at the same time helping the cause to fight cancer
Long time viewer, first time donatingI just had to donate for my favourite Sonic game that came out in 2006Good luck to Focus
Sonic '06?!Oh No!
#DarkMageBonne année à tout les runner, à tout les commentateurs et à tout les spectateurs, Nounous (nounours sans le r) vous fait un gros câlin et vous souhaite une très bonne semaine.
Finally seeing GDQ live, and am very happy to see this game again! Great to see another campaign other than Sonic's. Hope everyone has a great time!
What's up GDQ this is my first time donating. Shout out to all the rad people who make all of this possible. And a quick shout out to Dan Ryckert who is a personal hero of mine.
I'm so happy that AGDQ is back! Thanks to everyone that makes this possible and good luck to all the runners. Keep going fast and I'll keep donating during the event. This one goes to the 2p1c blindfolded Punch-Out run.
count how many sand is in this desert, omega
vriska
Focus! Fokasu-kun!!! It's been 4 years. FOUR. YEARS!!! Where did the time go? Gone are the days of Skype calls and Cookie Kiss. Now you're up there on the big stage, running the greatest dumpster fire game of all time. Is this how moms feel when their kids move out?! D: We may not speak much these days, but know your pal Alice is cheering you on from behind the screen. Best of luck on the run dude, give it your all! *Sips Tea* AH! The weather is nice today
Still no donations.
Don't have much to give but I wanna help out. Used to love this game as a kid for some reason.
Been watching youtube clips for years and finally caught the stream live, Had to donste during sonic 06 cause its the most buggy mess, donation to runners choice.
How fast do you think Sonic goes? I'd say about 90
Can't watch at work, but it's always fun to listen in the background and sneak a peek while no one's looking. Gotta say, I wasn't expecting to see Ceaseless Discharge in a Sonic game. You're all doing great work for a great cause, keep it up!
Loving this Sonic games block, and especially excited to see Sonic '06 with Silver, the cutest clueless hedgie! Hope everyone is having a great time, and what are everyone's feeling about the upcoming Sonic movie? Personally, I'm hoping it sets up Robotnik's origin story, as well as explains why he needs to capture Sonic and not destroy him. I also hope it is the first in a series and we get Shadow and Silver movies.
Hello GDQ and hello Focus! I hope the run goes great today, best of lucks in the remainder of the run, have fun and you got this! Lots of hugs from your Spaniard boi! Donation goes towards runner's choice!
Good evening from Russia.Although, Sonic 06 is garbage (it is not), this is the best game that I want to see on any GDQ!Good luck with the run!
Only the coolest of names for the coolest of eight-themed ladies!!!!!!!! (There's 8 - count 'em!)
My wife and I have been watching with our toddler since yesterday. We're huge fans of the GDQ and even bigger fans of preventing cancer! We're looking forward to seeing the rest of the runs this week!Oh, and one more thing...HONK!
Vriska may have done some things wrong, but there is absolutely nothing wrong about giving to a worthy cause such as the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Wishing all the runners the very best of luck!!!!!!!!
Cancer researcher and Sonic superfan here! Had to donate a second time during the Sonic block because these games mean the world to me.. yes, even the hot garbage that is Sonic '06. Back in kindergarten a boy in my class used to draw me pictures of Sonic - fast forward to a couple decades later and he put a RING on it and we have two little hedgehoglettes of our own! Thanks for your help in fighting cancer and Dr. Robotnik himself! <3 Kitty

loving the fast blue hedgehog runs!
The Sonic block is always entertaining, thanks to all the runners and support staff for making this event possible.
Long time watcher, first time donator! Love watching GDQ and the runners crushing games we all grew up with. Here's to kicking cancers butt and here's to more great runs! rooDuck rooSpy
First time donating! Sonic 06 has an... interesting history with me. Too much for me to put in a comment for GDQ, but let's just say that I have a small place in my heart for it, and it'll be great to see a side to Sonic 06 I don't see broken as often. Donating now because I won't be able to be here to see Pokemon Sapphire tomorrow because of work. :(
Vriska did nothing wrong
Hey FocusSight, Lucky here! I'm extremely excited to see everyone's favorite flygon finally grace the AGDQ stage! I can't think of a better ally to brave the janky Silver physics with than the Prevent Cancer Foundation: cheers and good luck on your run! ;)
AAARIN. I am Superman. I believe I can fly.
Attending AGDQ in my hometown of Orlando this year. I flew back from Vancouver, Canada to attend with my best friend Dylan. Thanks Focussight for showing off the broken mess that is Sonic 06 and I'm looking forward to seeing my favorite Fallout games broken down to bits
Give Blaze a hug for me please. <3
Keep on rockin' everyone, you're doing a great job! And to my wonderful boyfriend Zach: Hey, nerd.
You're doing a great job! Love from Scotland!
Shoutout to my brother Serril in the crowd--he and I attended our first AGDQ last year and I wish I could have gone with him this year as well.
Thank you, good luck on the rest of the run Focus! Hope trial skip goes well
I always heard this game was Garbage and it may be, but the way FocusSight also speedruns his voice is making me change my mind.
Gotta go the speed limit!
York Uni says lets raise more than ever!
I'd like to personally thank DarkSpinesSonic for saving me from playing this game normally, which it wouldn't let me
Hi GDQ! Great to see Sonic 06 being ran again at GamesDoneQuick, great to see Focus running it on the big screen! Donation towards runner's choice - Greetings from Australia
It's no use.
Can someone tell me if the dash tricks are frame perfect or not?
Hello from the audience! First in-person GDQ and I'm loving it. Good vibes all round. Good luck to everybody running!
Kirbymastah with his last donation during the sonic block. I hope this donation will be of Some Use - let it go to Focus's choice. Also are we going to see THE BOX showcased today? Good luck Focus Sight and shoutouts to the entire sonic couch and crowd for keeping up the hype!
Big shoutout to the dance crew in the first row! The moves are just dope!Thank you, AGDQ for all the work you wonderful people have done in the past 10 years. Cheer to you! Or as we in Germany would say: "HONK!" ;D

Hello, darlings, it's Taako, you know, from TV? Sizzle It Up With Taako? I know you have my cookbook, because you love me, and I love you! But, uh, problem is, I'm not seeing a lot of love right now. I'm seeing this Zap Brannigan fool taking the spotlight, and uhhh if that's what you want, that regrettable hair representing the entire known universe, that's okay, I guess...but here's what I'm gonna do: I'm donating three gold for every time I was completely awesome today, and because I know *MY* fans are generous, good-looking, cancer-hating talents, and because I rolled an 18, I'm betting they'll match that awesomeness quota. Just leave a comment on how I inspired you to greatness, put aaaall those piggy banks on my name, and we'll kick cancer in the pants, what do you say? Friendly competition?
Donating one dollar for each time Focus says a trick is frame perfect. This donation is itself frame perfect!
I love Vriska and hate cancer! (i still love karkat tho dont worry)
This donation was frame perfect

Shout out to my favorite girl to watch GDQ with! Love you Anna!
Greetings from Germany
honk!
Hey Focus Buddy! I think my last donation fell into the depths, but I said I would donate again if you got Trial Skip! Though I said I would donate $50, but unlike you, I am not a Math Major.
Sonic 2006 is a celebration. Have a comfy and classy time!
I'll be back with more donations, but I have to try and win the work of art that is Gotta Go Quick for my oldest, Sonic-iest friend. (He doesn't know he wants it. He's wrong.) Thanks for a fantastic Sonic Block!
This run of sonic 06 is frame perfect, every frame.
So glad I made it home before the end of the Sonic block to make this donation. Gotta go fast!
Hey AGDQ, Cancer took my dad 6 years ago, I told my mom about what you guys have done and continue to do to help fight it. She wanted to say this to all of you:The oncologist said, “I wish we could eradicate Colitis”, which is what my husband had for 20 years before his cancer…not what I expected him to say. Many diseases have an increased chance of cancer associated with them. I applaud you for your innovative fundraising to prevent cancer before it starts! Keep gaming! Thank you.
Greetings from Denmark.
Only saw the last half, but that was great!
Fallout 1 and 2 are some of my favorite classic RPGS. Glad to see them and their spiritual successors run for a good cause.
hey all. donating this in honor of my dad who passed away in march due to pancreatic cancer. let's keep fighting for a future without cancer! shout-outs to everyone in the rolling start discord.
It's looking pretty safe, but my boyfriend desperately wants the Outer Worlds character name to be ZapBrannigan, so I'm doing my part to help him stay excited about watching his first AGDQ with me <3
thank you for doing every year the great events and lets fight cancer together.Danke, dass ihr immer wieder diesen tollen restream auf die Beine stellt. RUMMEL!!

Love AGDQ. I went last year but couldn't make it to this one. Had to continue my yearly donation. Also had to make sure to donate to one of my favorite game franchises! Good luck to the runner. P.S HYPE!
Cannot wait to be absolutely BAFFLED by how tomatoangus manages to complete all of Fallout in just over two hours. SO HYPE.
Good luck with the runs tomato! Fallout 3, NV and 4 are some my favourite games, and it's really fun seeing them broken in so many ways. I'm pretty new to watching speedrunning, but between summoningsalt and gamesdonequick it's been an enjoyable 12 months or so.First time donating, so thanks for raising money for a good cause!
My first donation, Watching AGDQ knowing my fiancé is out there watching too! I love you
Ayy Bobboh!
Running all the real fallout games heh ? Good luck to tomatoangus !

Hello, its a great show as always. I watch AGDQ for three years now. Sadly I am working now so I am able to see less content but I have to follow the fallout run. Good luck and keep up this good project! :)
Huge Fallout fan and can't wait to see what can be done to these games!
My first time getting to watch live! You can do it Tomato!
Fallout is literally one of the first RPGs I tried my hardest to beat the fastest even before I knew there was such a thing as speedrunning. So excited to see it being ran at AGDQ! Donations.. donations never ends.
Amde here from the Chatmod-Team. Thanks for the great event once more and thanks to every other person that is helping onside and offside.
A Fallout Anthology run at AGDQ? That's the bomb! But hey, doesn't radiation CAUSE cancer? Here's some money to try to prevent it instead! Thanks for the amazing runs and supporting an awesome cause year after year!
I'm stoked to be able to watch Tommy destroy Anthology and cancer simultaneously! Cancer sucks and I'm glad to see so many people that agree
Howdy doodily honkerinos
Hey Tomato,Been enjoying your Fallout content on Youtube for quite some time. I really appreciate that you take the time to explain the skips you use during your runs, and its so impressive how you run all the main Fallout games back to back to back. You're one of the most entertaining runners and I'm so excited you got to be a part of AGDQ this year. Here's a little something from a fan, keep doing what you doing!Put this towards Tomato's choice.
First time donation here! As I sit at work and click away at Photoshop I'm absolutely enjoying these magnificent runs! All the best to every runner and <honk!>. CHEERS!
Give the Dancing Guy in the audience a medal!
Have to donate during one of my favorite franchises of all time. Fallout has gotten me through some rough times, and I'm thoroughly looking forward to seeing them all go by at the speed of light! Good luck to tomatoangus, and thanks to everyone making this fantastic event possible~!
Gotta go fast
Been watching AGDQ for awhile now, and this is the first year I've been financially stable enough to donate. Thank you to all the runners and staff who dedicate their time to this amazing cause.
Hi Everyone, excited to be here. My Daughter was just born a few hours ago, and i thought it was a perfect time to get my first ever Donation to a GDQ.In Honor to her Birthday I will Donate towards naming Rinoa in FFVIII, Lucia. Good Luck to all the Runners and God Bless my Friends!
Keep dancing on Kirby's music! AGDQ also cure sadness ! Love
Nothing a machete can't fix!
So honored to spend this week watching games smashed to pieces and supporting a good cause with my wife. Abby, I love you, and it is a joy to share each day with you.
Let's see if I can do this right... H... uh... Hunk? Well, Goose... I tried!
HONK for Outer Worlds President!
Is there anything better than coming home from a long day of work, cracking open an ice cold Nuka Cola, catching the Fallout speedrun, and donating to fight cancer? I don't think so. Thanks!
Best time of the year ! keep up the great work, love you all
Good luck runners! Here's to making Castlevania harder!
Take my bottlecaps, Edo! Unfortunatelly it's too late for me to watch the run. I blame Poochi. Good night!
My grandmothers brain cancer has relapce and she doesnt want to go through more rounds of kemo, she would much rather spend time with her family. Its crushing to watch what this dose to my family and I dont wish it upon anyone. Heres all I can donate this gdq sadly to help. Every penny helps work twoards a cancer free world.
Can't wait for the Fallout run, so here's my first donation of the week!
It's not much but it's honest money. Really love the Idea of combining videogames and a good cause. Keep it up!
Sonic Block was awesome AGDQ HYPE!
What's good GDQ? First time able to donate! I've been watching Fallout speedruns for ages, excited to see the entire series get deconstructed in a matter of minutes!Can I get a Honk from the Honksquad?

Greetings from Austria!Good luck to all the Runners :)
For my dad who just started Chemo today for his Prostate Cancer
I almost cried when I heard you guys are playing my favorite games of all time. I love you guys and think what you do is awesome
First time watching live and donating woot
Hey TomatoAngus! So happy to see you on the big stage. That's a real "G" move.
It's always a pleasure to hear from Edobean during GDQ! Donation to announcer's choice, and it'll be doubled if we hear Edobean do their favorite tongue twister!
This is a great time of the year and I always love seeing so many games destroyed in enjoyable new ways. And HONK!
This is the first GDQ I've ever donated at! Really loved all the runs in the Sonic block, thank you so much to all the runners for showing off their stuff on all those games! Putting this towards getting "Vriska" as Rinoa's name in Final Fantasy 8, which I'm really looking forward to!
Long time watcher, first time donating. Lost my dad last year to cancer and I hope this money helps no one else go through the same hardship I have.
The hedgehog pillow for donations brings me peace. I can outrun my nightmares while I sleep.
I wonder how many honks are in the fallout series.... At least this one, honk!
Tomato, show the memory den who's boss!
The sun has done so much for us all. It provides light and warmth and makes life possible. So shouldn't we show our appreciation with a nice hug? Put this toward saving the sun in the Outer Worlds - because suns are better than people! Good luck to tomato and sharo on their runs!
Long time watcher first time donator, my grandpa died of lung cancer a long while ago and I'm glad that the gaming community is so happy to band together to yeet cancer into the sun.
Hi Tomato, watching from Melbourne, Australia on my first speedrun live. Best of luck on your run.
Thanks for the good work you do!
Fallout is one of my favorite series. So excited to see all of these games in succession tonight!
Charity. Charity never changes... unless it involves video games!
My dad was diagnosed with cancer and had his lung and rub removed in 1997. He was told he wasn't able to live 6 months but he made it to 2013 when he finally passed away. It makes me happy to see such a great and amazing community coming together and fighting against something that took someone so dear to my life from me. Keep up the amazing work!!
Good luck Tommy, glad to see the name change fixed things.
Good luck, Tomato booty! I bet they never introduced mutant geese because it'd be to OP, honk!Lost my mom to cancer when I was 4 years old. Great cause and great event! Thank you GDQ!
Hyped for this Fallout Anthology run! Question for runner and couch: What's your favorite game in the series?
keep up all the great work.
Fallout is the genre that defined open world shenanigans for me! Love seeing them completed in record time, while it usually took me hundreds of hours (who is Shaun again?). Keep being awesome!Also: Fallout 3 & New Vegas remaster when Bethesda?
I doubt we'll see her in the run, but here's $5 for my girl Veronica, the best companion in all of Fallout. If anyone disagrees, well I guess they'll have to donate to prove me wrong ;)
Fallout HYPE!
Phineas is the best person to stop cancer so this goes towards saving him. Will donate an extra 5 if someone says any NCR trooper quote.
Thanks to all the runners and all the staff and volunteers for another amazing event.
Cancer sucks. Let's get rid of it once and for all. Y'dig?Love to the runners!
Playing games about radiation to fight cancer; seems apt. Love me some fallout.
Love us some tomatoes! Yours truly, Myla, Lola and Clark
Holy cow, I actually caught a GDQ?? The Overseer said this was starting NEXT week. Well, thank goodness we ran outta water and got to see it in time! You go Tomato! Donation to runner's choice!
Gary!
good job tomato!
So excited I get to catch the Fallout Anthology live!

I guess it was nothing.
Honk, Honk Puny Human!
if only someone had told benny that his life was going to be this way
Here's $11 in honor of my favorite Vault in the series. Keep crushing this run, Tomatoangus!
GDQ: So which Fallout game are you running?TomatoAngus: Yes.
Such a joy watching Tomato tear down my favorite Fallout games! Love the totally non-sarcastic storytelling by him as well :P
$25 in store credit for this incredible run
My kids and I look forward to watching GDQ every year. This year is a bit different because I'm watching in my wife's hospital room as she battles stage 4 bladder cancer. Thanks to all the runners for providing me with some stress relief!Here's to Preventing Cancer in the future, and finding cures for those fighting cancer.
Loving this Fowl-Out anthology run. Great to see you spread your wings in New Ve-Goose, my favorite of the series. Let's keep those donations going and nuke cancer! Honk!
Can't wait to see the Air Bud of speedrunning go through Memory Den!
Papa Paul Bless
When making Latte art in my coffee it didn't work, guess I forgot something.Well,I guess it was frothing.
This franchise means a lot to me - so naturally I'll be donating to celebrate its being utterly destroyed. Good luck!
Best fallout runs ever, thank you tomato
We all know Edobean can "Poyo!", but can Edobean "Honk!"? I'll donate another $25 to her choice of incentive if she does!
I've loved GDQ since I first started watching it years ago but have never been in a place to donate. That all changed this year when I finally got a great job and things couldn't be going better, so now it's my turn to join in the fun. Fallout has been one of my favorite series since I first played the first one over a decade ago so now seems like the perfect time to donate. Putting this toward the bonus game incentive, because more GDQ is best GDQ. Good luck to all the runners and let's make it so no one has to worry about cancer in the post nuclear wasteland.
Love to see such a great run and amazing commentary from my favorit speedrunner. Thank you GDQ and everyone involved for this amazing event! Big shout out to my pal Jesper for getting me into watching speedruns. Can we get a crowd HYPE!?
Hoping I get my frame perfect inputs during this amazing Fallout 4 run to get this donation through!
Long time watcher first time donating. Fallout was my first love when I got into PC games. Been an absolute pleasure watching what took me so long to beat absolutely destroyed. I guess in the end it was nothing.
I just have to donate for this awesome runner!
Loving Tomato explaining how to break Fallout. Keep up the great work everyone!
Silent 'G'? It must have been nothing.
Hey Tomato! I first found your channel through your... Interesting Mama Murphy speedrun and I've been a fan ever since. Good luck on your run! Incentive goes to runner's choice.
Good luck to my favorite nephew with love from North Carolina
I guess it was nothing.
I was going to donate $25 but the solo cup explanation deserved double.
The only Fallout that helps prevent cancer! What an achievement.Thank you for the amazing solo cup explanation!
Had to donate for the use of stunning visual aid.
Tomatos and muffin? interesting combination! good luck on the run tomato; and Mr. Covert Muffin, if you really are covert, does that mean you 100 in sneak?
Watching tomato angus almost makes me wish for a nuclear winter
PREVENT ALL OF THE CANCERS!!!
That explanation was complicated. So you're telling me Chocolatine is made of pipe cleaners?
Donating for the most complicated and impressive out of bounds glitch I’ve seen in a while!
here's to tomato for that helluva explanation and then pulling it off!
I really like tomato's visual aid.
All Fallout games matter, except for 76.
Thanks for that excellent explanation of COC planes
Excellent run so far, and it's always great to see New Vegas. In the spirit of the old west, I'll donate another 25 if Covertmuffin gives us some finger guns.

Homestuck
TomatoAngus sounds like Doc Brown in Back to the Future explaining time travel with models.
I love every single one of you. Can we get a round of applause for this amazing commentary?
This commentary is the best; go, Tomatoangus!
Shout out to the Space Jam. Great run and RIP Chet.
Lost my dad to cancer back in high school so I gotta donate to the cause. Also tomatoangus’ glitch props are amazing! Wait what was that? I guess it was nothing... :)
I started watching Tomato's runs after watching his youtube commentary for a slightly different category of the fallout anthology, so thought I'd donate now.
New Vegas was so buggy it crashed the GDQ website. Have my 25 caps for this amazing run.
::::)
Excellent visual aid helped me learn!
Really enjoying these Fallout runs, especially the commentary!
Epic Fallout run! Two hours and VAT’s all, folks!
I've never played any Fallout game in my life but Tomatoangus has me thoroughly entertained. Thanks for the lovely run!
Angus is the guy who does the entire group project and gets us all an A by proxy. Arts and crafts skills over 9000!
Hey, can Tomatoangus help my friend Claire. She tried quicksaving and quickloading in real life and she's caught in a wall. Thanks for any help!
Donating to yeet into the sun! I found out last week that I'll unfortunately be losing my job soon, so AGDQ has been my beacon of light. I love you all (and especially my boyfriend, Zach)!
Wow TomatoAngus, that is the best explanation of any speedrun tech in the history of GDQ. Props! Rap God talking. 10/10 speedrun
Shout out to my bro and bestie Ian, who’s always been my favorite person to play Fallout with until we cry-laugh. And shout out to Tomatoangus, my very favorite speed runner. GDQ HYPE!!
The fallout anthology runner is also the fallout anthology couch, love it! Dear couch: love you too!
I loved the explanation for the elevator skip in Fallout 4. Now I'm interested in learning it myself. Great speedrun! Keep up the awesome work!
Love fallout, this run is absolutely amazing!
Gary?
Watching Tomato's Fallout run. Super fun explanations of the speed tech ... with props! So, here's props to you.
Amazing runs across all these great games with fantastic commentary and insightful couch. The only thing that would have made this better is if tomato wore the Pip Boy from the Fallout 3 Collectors Edition. HONK!
HONK!!!!
Excited to be watching GDQ live instead of rewatching on YouTube, and glad to be able to donate to the cause. Just finished Outer Worlds last night, so I can't help but influence the ending. My donation isn't the best choice, it's Spacers Choice!
Quickload
4 Insane Fallout runs for the price of one! Loving GDQ so far. Donation goes to FF8 Blindfolded Menuing. You'll see why ;)
I've spent considerably more time on the Fallout games than 2 hours. This run is a delight!
Absolutely loving the event so far. Shout outs to TomatoAngus for making his Fallout runs the most entertaining runs I've ever seen! Keep it up everyone!
You'll see why.
Nothing in GDQ history has brought me more joy than Tomato bringing out a physical model to explain a trick. here's $40 for that 40 seconds saved!
thank you for your contribution to this great cause , keep on the good work
Big ups to Silent G for the best run slash set of runs I've ever seen
Wee Woo
You think this is terribly broken? Have you TRIED the VR version?
This is for Brad, whom cancer prevented from watching a run of one of his favorite games, Fallout 2. Actually this whole run is unbelievable, a 3-D diagram of clipping?! Who does that? TomatoAngus does. So here's my donation... Can I get store credit?
Loving all of these crazy Fallout glitches.
Greeting from Safespace!
Can't get any more fascinating than Tomato's Fallout 4 run and explanations. Looking forward to more from GDQ.
Finally got my girlfriend watching AGDQ. She isn't much of a gamer but loves watching the people dance at the events. I'll donate ANOTHER 75$ if we can get a dance party going. Donation runners choice.
Hyped Honk
I guess it was nothing, Honk!
Good job on the run so far Tomato. My sincere apologies for taking part in the overstratting this game. I regret nothing.
Loving this Fallout speedrun!!
This is a second twenty five bucks today because Mr.Angus is basically killing this set of fallout runs. the intrigue, the drama, the dioramas!
Hey Tom, big fan. Love you and your commentary, big thanks to you and GDQ for making this night one to look forward to!
Doubling down for CovertMuffin doubling down on pants on the couch.This Fallout 4 run is great!
I’ve been watching GDQs since 2013 and am always blown away, but this anthology run has been incredible. Great job Angus and the couch. Donation goes to runners choice.
GDQ is amazing
Did you Science the Door?
This is the greatest run I have ever seen! Keep up the good work! HYPE
Looking forward to The Outer Worlds. Here's $50 to naming the player after the most dashing and heroic space captain in the galaxy. Good luck to all the runners!
Guess it was nothing...Love these events, keep it up guys.Weh
I've been watching GDQ events since 2015 and have managed to make it to two of them. Bummed I couldn't make it this year, but I've been loving watching it so far! Let's beat these games and lets beat cancer!
Awesome event. Always awesome to see gamers unite to help those in need.
This Fallout run is the best GDQ run ever
This is way better than Golden Globes.
I don't think I have ever seen such a lively glitch exhibition before. Tomato, you are awesome.Greetings from a German with totally messed up sleep schedule
Talk Russian To Me
Love to all the staff, runners, and volunteers, especially my fellow mods <3
Had to donate for the Taylor Swift pipboy and the pants stacks! Bet you cant break the game a little more!
Fallout is my brothers favorite game. He loves to do mods for Fallout 3. I was never as big into it but I decided to watch this and it has been so enjoyable. You are so easy to listen to and your explanations are so great. Amazing run so far Tomato!
This Fallout run is amazing. Props to mister anGus and the couch.
i guess it was nothing
TomatoAngus is amazing, what a legendary run! Fallout 4 has never been so fun! Shout out to the 502 Krew! ORB
donation page back!
So, did you just stumble upon those pants?all this imagery is making the run look easy
Everybody knows that you should make Rinoa’s name Vriska. It only makes sense.
Been watching for a long time first time giving. You all have given me hours of enjoyment. Keep up the great work. Good luck runners. Honk
I have lost several family members to cancer, and I have always used video game as part of my grieving process. It is awesome to see people coming together to do something I love for such a great cause.
This Fallout run is *incredible*
Been watching for five years since I discovered you all while recovering from getting my wisdom teeth out, I haven’t missed an event ONCE . You all do such wonderful work and im so glad I can finally contribute financially. Lets get a round of applause for all the volunteers and runners! They're putting in so much hard work for this great cause! THANK YOU SO MUCH! HONK!!!!!!!!!! :O)
Long time watcher & first donating. Thank you all for everything that you do to make this event possible.
Shout outs to Covert Muffin for wearing all of those pants!
The visual aids for the elevator alone deserve a donation, much less forcing Covert to be dummy thicc.
Great commentary, great speedrun and great pants!
More pants!
Hi there first viewer and donator I really enjoy watching speed runs and I am happy i found GDQ Good luck on the run
Covertmuffin is just like everyone else he puts on his seven pairs of pants one leg at a time
 (Comment rejected)
Hey AGDQ! I am donating $5 for each extra pair of pants the couch puts on! Thank you for bringing funds to a much needed cause!
How many pants must a man put on, before he has too many pants?
Really enjoying the Fallout Anthology runs and this runner is very entertaining. Keep up the great work.
Loving the Fallout runs. Keep up the good work.
I think I missed 3 pants while I donated for the last pair... time to pay up!
covert's muffin is gonna be really toasty after 30 more minutes in 7 pairs of sweat pants....
Wow, this Fallout Anthology run is one of the most informative runs I've ever seen! Hats off to TomatoAngus and Pants On to CovertMuffin!
Currently watching AGDQ from Vermont and celebrating for our friend's bachelor party. Congratulations to Anderson and may all the runners be blessed with positive RNG vibes!
I demand all runs include props from now on.
TOMATO, REPEAT AFTER ME: HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKK 🦆
Good luck to the runners!
Extra pants means more rad resistance, right? Only one way to find out. Great run!
Shout out to Tomato and his couch for what is easily one of the best runs I’ve seen in a long time. I’m going to put on a few more pairs of pants, now.
Jimmy is my brother and an awesome guy, so his excellent music should be chosen for the SIGIL playthrough. Your ears will thank you! Oldschool MIDI for life!
Never heard of TomatoAngus before but watching this Fallout run has me rolling. His props and pants one me over, so this donation is dedicated to you bud.
Tomatoangus, I love your detailed explanations and the way you keep looking into the camera. It makes your run really engaging! Thanks! Also, honk.
Cancer took my best friend this year, so here's a dollar for every year of her life. In memory of Stephanie Marie Besterci 💘
Tomatoangus might be doing one of the funniest speed runs I've ever watched. He's like the Carrot Top of the speedrunning community (that's a compliment right?). Thank you for changing your name for us and thank you to all the people working behind the scenes that are helping make all of this possible.
#doomtwid Give me those sweet Jimmy MIDIs!
This run of all the Fallout games is amazing!

Gotta go fast
I was doing dishes at the start of the Fallout Anthology run... and you people made it to Fallout 3 before I finished! I can't speedrun chores that fast!
Got to donate during Tomato's fallout anthology run. Love the props.
Shoutout to Spike Vegeta on tomato's pipboy!
Regarding the Fallout 4 portion of Fallout Anthology... WHAT
I've loved the Fallout series since the original. Shout out to my partner, Chris! Thanks for introducing me to GDQ! I love you with all my heart!
One of the best runs I’ve seen. The runner is so charismatic and informative. Keep up the good work, and I’m excited to see what else is in store for the week!

This is my first time donating to GDQ, and I'm so glad its been scientifically proven that wearing more pants makes you run faster. Love all the work you're doing to help stop cancer!
Thanks Tomato for a great Fallout run and commentary
Hey Tomato, could you explain that last part again?
Thanks for all the hard work, both the staff and runners <3

A good friend of mine lost her mother to cancer last summer. She's a big Fallout fan and I wanted to make a donation during one of her favorite game series, even though I know she'd disapprove of skipping so much plot.
The Fallout Anthology run is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. Taylor Swift is behind everything!
Tomato is an incredible commentator and talented speedrunner, I had so much fun watching your run. Thank you!!
AGDQ time again! This is my fourth year following this amazing event and it blows me away every time. Big thanks to all the people behind the scenes keeping the stream up for all of us online. GDQ Hype!

Had to donate during one of my favorite games. So stylistic with a great retro feel.My friend just lost his mother to cancer today and it only makes sense to donate now. Could we get a round of applause in solidarity for my friend Kav?
Yeah, man. Frick cancer!
Having the devs and people who work on Amid Evil has made the run super fun! Thanks to all the staff and runners and here's to 10 more years!
Amid Evil was my Game of the Year for 2019! Haven't seen what the speedrun of it looks like, but I'm sure it'll be crazy!

Round of applause for this great group of people banding together to help the world in a positive way. 2020 is off to a great start!
Have to donate before the Doom games, what you guys do every year is amazing and always for a great cause! Many of my family members have been taken far to early and my girlfriends grandma, Mimi, is going through a fight with it now. Let's keep donating to help prevent cancer from taking any more of our loved ones!
Wanted to give some money during an amazing run thanks to both the runner, the couch, and the devs.
It's OK Amid Evil devs. They're not exploits; they're "Advanced User Features."
Dev Couches are some of the best couches!

DOOOOOOOM. Give to Runner's Choice

Broken game breaking devs in real time. So worth it.
GDQ is AMAZING! My partner got me hooked a few years ago, and now every GDQ we put on our t-shirts and get to spend many wonderful hours together watching mind boggling speed runs. This donation is in honor of Sarah. We miss you.Together, we can rip and tear cancer apart!Now how about a $5 DOOM donation train people?! RIP & TEAR, HONK & HONK!!!

HONK, RIP, and tear
My wonderful music mentor, Varien, bought me Doom (2016) so that I could listen to the amazing music. Paying it forward here in the Doom block. =
Lets rip cancers face off with some Doom Block donations
Loved the Amid Evil run! Just looked this game up, and saw that it was released on my dad's birthday. I lost him to cancer three years ago and Heretic and Hexen were two of his absolute favorite games. If that's not a sign to donate, I don't know what is! Thanks for the amazing run and all the wonderful work you do every year!
DOOT!
Did you know that Iggyzig is my favorite host and that AGDQ is my favorite charity event? These are facts I thought you should know.

Nathan, donate $20 when you hear this being read. After that, take out the trash. Thank you.
Doom is love, doom is life...
Very fun GDQ so far! That Fallout run was just wild! The diorama was a great touch. GO FAST everybody! Shout outs to the 502 Krew!
Hope everyone's in a Doom mooD!
Hey Convert Muffin, are you still wearing those pants?

That IDDQD guy was pretty cool, but that cancer guy sure isn't. RIP AND TEAR!
*BFG intensifies*
Playing Doom and Wolfenstein 3D is what inspired me to be a developer in the first place. Carmack and Romero are my heroes. Can I get a “DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS, DEVELOPERS!” from the audience?
We both love DOOOOM and GDQ so much! Had to donate a little in celebration of one of our favorite games. Good luck to byteme and RIP N TEAR!! <3

That Amid Evil run was delightful, dev cussing and all! Definitely grabbing that game!
So much hype for Doom block! RIP AND TEAR... cancer.

Gotta see my Girl get to 3rd Climax!
Hey AGDQ! So stoked I could catch this live. I lost both my grandpa and a dear friend to cancer in 2014 and 2015, respectively. It's not much, but here's something to help out the cause!
Awesome inspiration work
*Heavy metal starts*
Frick cancer in the bum! Tell your mom tell your dad we were super rad!
I'm dedicating this donation to my sister, who recently lost her dog to cancer. He was such an adorable people person who was a precious member of our family. Remember, cancer affects all life, not just humans. Love your furry friends with all your heart. Good luck to all the runners! P.S.... HONK!
Just finished Doom 1 and 2 for the first time a few days ago, and they are absolutely among the best games I've ever played in terms of moment to moment gameplay, so its really cool to see a Doom block to sate my newfound Doom hunger. Good luck to all the runners, and thanks to GDQ and everyone behind it for all you do.
3rd climax go go go!

QA Tester for Doom Eternal, big fan of the Any% runs and looking forward to seeing how ya'll break the 100% run!
This for the dancers in the front row. Way to keep the set up times as entertaining as the runs!
the droid is readyhey hey
:)
[in serious tone] In the first age, in the first battle, when the shadows first lengthened, One stood. He chose the path of perpetual torment. In his ravenous hatred, he found no peace. And with boiling blood, he scoured the umbral plains, seeking vengeance against the dark lords who had wronged him. And those that suffered his wrath only heard his cry..."HONK!"
Speedruns are temporary. Doom is eternal
Greeting from Germany at 5 am. I lost three close family members to cancer, and a third one is fighting it right now. Anything to help eradicate this awful disease is a worthwhile cause in my book.
Doomguy for Smash 2019
Donating in memory of John 'Totalbiscuit' Bain. Taken from all of us far too soon by this horrible disease. Not a week goes by that I don't miss hearing his take on something in the industry. RIP John. We miss you.
Wanted to give a shout of to WillyG who just moved from the Intensive Care Unit to long term treatment. He’s a fighter and we all know if anyone can solve it, he can. So looking forward to this Doom run. It’s one of the first games I owned and got me started in tech all those years ago.
This donation is for the Legendary Dancing dudes in the crowd, you go Captain Dad and Blue Dad!
Hey AGDQ, long time watcher, first time donator. Haven't heard a lot of our lord and savior ORB, but we're still early in the week. Save the frames, and no, YOU'RE BREATHTAKING
It's 4am, I just finished an essay due tomorrow, can't wait to see a great run of Doom 2016!
Tear and Rip, Save the cacodemons!!!
10 years already?! You're amazing. Yes, you! All of you! #zhtDoom
RIP and TEAR until it's done! Best of luck to Byteme, cant wait to see them destroy the game!
I donated one dollar for every time the Amid Evil team said a bad word, then threw in a few extra. Frick cancer in the bum.
Doomblock so far has been one of the best blocks I've watched in a while. Glad to see Amid Evil get some love, and can't wait to see some demons gibbed quick in Doom16. Rip and tear, until it is done.
God bless every one of you who helps these runs happen, and God bless every one of you who donates and sacrifices for others this event!
Doom Cancer!

Doom gave me palpitations when I first played it casually. I'm glad to see it beaten and broken down like it did to my poor heart.

Super excited for this Doom run, and it's for a good cause! Win,win!
I've been watching SGDQ and AGDQ for 4 years now. I'm grateful for what you guys are doing! I've lost my grandpa 2 years ago to a rare skin cancer and I'm grateful for everyone that donates even if it's a little! From me and my family. Thank you to everyone donating and everyone organising this event!
I have recently beat Doom (2016) myself, so I'm really looking forward to this Speedrun crushing everything.Rip and Tear!

After a long hard day at work, it's so great to come home to AGDQ with Covert on the mic! Everything GDQ community does feels my heart with joy, Thank you, All of you, so much! ... HONK :)
Great event (as always!) and those Amid Evil devs were a hoot.
Love the event so far. Been looking forward to the doom block all day. DOOOOOOOOOM!

BYTE! Best of luck to you on this run! Rip and Tear until it is done!!
I appreciate everything you guys do for charity. Glad I was able to donate during DOOM. Good luck to the runner!
In the first age, in the first battle...The doomslayer clipped through the wall and went straight to the end
looks like it its time to rip and tear cancer apart
DOOOOOOOOM
ByteMe, the Science G! Byte! Byte! Come on over...
I had to donate to GDQ for a great cause and to make JoeDamillio's Super Castlevania 4 run tomorrow that much more challenging. Good luck to the runners and excellent job to the GDQ crew!
It took me 2 hours to get past the first level on Nightmare! Good luck!
Had to donate during doom, one of my favorite games of the last decade. Seeing byteme crush nightmare mode will feel so good after the HOURS of pain I spent completing it. Good luck to all the runners!
DOOOOOOOOOOOD!!
Die cancer. You don't belong in this world.
Announcer please give us your best shot at imitating the Doom BFG Division soundtrack! Thank you and lets kick some cancer demons in the face!
Rip and tear.
Doom hype!!!
I think there's a typo for the game title, I'm pretty sure it's actually called "DOOT"
Hey guys!! First time donating and catching doom live!!!! Good luckDOOOM!!!
No Byteme, you ARE the demons
Have to donate during DOOM! Easily one of the best shooters released in modern history, and one of my favorite runs for any GDQ!
Hey AGDQ. When I was a kid, my grandmother bought me my first gaming console, a Sega Genesis, which led me onto a path to working on video games myself, the first of which professionally was DOOM 2016 itself. At the end of last year, I sadly lost her to cancer. Without her, I would not have be where I am or who I am, and for that I am forever grateful. Tonight, I donate in her memory to one day help people to never go through what she did, and to help others never have to experience the pain my family did in losing her. Thank you Nana for everything you have done for me. I love you and miss you.
Doom block is best block! My fiancé and I have watched every GDQ together since the summer we met, and it’s a really special event for us, so thanks to all the runners and staff making it possible. Rip and tear!!
I always like DOOM as a kid, but my parent's wouldn't let me play it. I got to play spyro instead (which was phat), but I would always sneak onto the PC to hammer out a few hours killing demons. Cheers to GDQ, Cheers to doom, and Cheers to spyro
Rip and tear until it is done..
Hello! First time donating with more on the way this week! Donating to everyone who is fighting or has fought cancer! Thinking of you uncle
Good morning from the UK! Work is going to suck today after being up since 2am, but it's worth it to watch Byte (and the couch!) run DOOM live for charity. Say hi to Olivia and Sammy for me, and let's rip and tear cancer until it is done.
♥
DOOM 2016 is one of my favorite games of all time, and I cant wait to see how Byteme rips and tears it up!
Do you know your GDQ run history? I'm going to pretend I don't because I'm glad we're Doomed to repeat it! :D
I'm really excited for the upcoming DOOM run. It's going to be a HELL of a time, and I'm sure ByteMe is going to SLAY the game; I'm CACO-ing just thinking about it. We're all ETERNALly grateful for everything this marathon represents. With these $5 and everyone else's donations, I'm sure cancer will MEET!!!IT'S!!!!!!!...... shoot, I can't think of a good pun here. Audience, can you help me out here?
This donation is 100% for seeing BT on the couch during Doom :)
I put on 7 pairs of pants in order to get home in time to watch Doom from the comfort of my 100% nightmare couch. Save the frames, rip and tear the demons.
Byte, have a great run! Love your streams and remember: Vega in the streets, Baron in the sheets
Kill every last one of them! ...Wait, wrong game. Still, pretty sound advice.
Had to donate during one of my favorite games of all time, DOOM 2016, being run by a real master of the game. 100% Nightmare is no joke, and in under 3 hours is just insane! Good luck on the run ByteMe, Rip and Tear!
My aunt and grandpa died of cancer, and my mom was diagnosed last year. Thank you so much for everything you do. Let's put an end to all the loss and keep families strong!
Hey there, long time watcher, third time donating, love what you guys do, and just had to donate during the game that I'm in. Good luck on the run and remember, rip and tear until it is done.
One of my earliest gaming memories is playing the shareware version of DooM on my grandfather's old MS DOS PC. Unfortunately he was taken by lung cancer in 2000. Here's to you, Sarge! Lock and load, Slayers! Rip and tear cancer until it is done!
DOOM at AGDQ? Ecstatic to see the Doom community represented by some of the best. Let's RIP the definition of cancer right out of the dictionary AND TEAR it to shreds.#DoomCanByteMe
Looking forward to this speedrun of the best FPS of this past decade, rip and tear!!
DOOOOOM!
DOOM is one of my boyfriend’s favourite game to speed run! We are so excited to watch it this year. Thanks for harnessing the power of speed running for a great cause!
Really excited to see the Doom 2016 100% run - good luck ByteMe, rip and tear!
I have been playing all the Doom games since 1994. I still have a DOS computer setup just to play the classics!
Just finished Doom last week. LOVED IT! **SING METAL NOISES** DSH DSH DEERRR DSH DSH DEER **CHAINSAWW SOUNDDD**
Doomguy is 💓
My this donation be doomed to punch out Mike Tyson
My spouse and I have been wrapping up our nights watching some of our favorite games get snapped over the knees of these amazing runners for an incredible cause. Big thank you to the runners, announcers and coordinators who put so much work into making this event happen.Let's kick cancer in its sorry butt and break some more awesome games. AGDQ HOYPE!!
Shoot the things until they die.
Here's 2016 big boys for DOOM 2016. Let's glory kill cancer!
DOOM's the GOTY for 2016, thanks for making this run!
Rip and tear
We've watched GDQ for years and are excited to finally donate! Thank you so much to all the runners, hosts, organizers, and GDQ staff for making the world a better place. Frick cancer in the bum!
Honk and Tear
Love me some Doom. This one goes out to MAH MAN, Tom. Rawadiss 9 for life.
From the Future A'Deary's
Doom 2016 was such a surprisingly fun game for me that got me back into shooters and I love seeing it run in GDQ. Here is $25 to fight Omega Weapon in Final Fantasy 8.I'll donate 25 more dollars to Coverts choice if he sings the Doom song from Invader Zim.<Here are the lyrics>doom de doom doom doom do de doooooooom dooom do doom deee doooooom do dom dooom doom
Byte HYPE!It's been a joy being your moderator Byte!
Byte told me he was anti-smoking but how can that be with a smoking hot set of Doom runners on camera? Shoutouts to my Doom boys, congrats Dime on a great Sigil run, and good luck Byte on the 2016 run!
Great runs from some great people! Those Doom vinyls look demonically tasty.
Please turn up the music, everyone in the chat is begging for it.
DOOM block? Time to donate!
Chainsaw Bromance Hype!
Hey crowd, you know argent cells are orbs, right? Just sayin'.
This Doom run is amazing! Keep on slaying those demons.
(Please read this during the Final Fantasy VIII speedrun because Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite Final Fantasy and the only one I liked playing and with the remastered version on PS4, I might go back and earn the platinum for it!)While I spent over $159 for my favorite MMO, I know that many can't play games like I do because of cancer, so I am giving this donation because you are so wonderful and give up your free time, your money and your sanity for charity. One day, I plan to find a way to stream for charity and get a chair that helps me sit comfortably while streaming for long marathons. You are the true heroes!I wanted to donate for prizes but I probably would win any and getting a prize for donating sounds a bit crass, so instead, I want to put an incentive. Since the only Pokemon incentives are too obvious, I decided to donate for Suhalia Silver in Blazing Chrome to start off the bid war. Good luck!
Watching the Doom block every GDQ be like,"I'm going to sing the Doom song now!doomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomdoomTHE END!"
Because "squall's fursona" has too many characters...
Shoutout to my buddy Beef who cant watch right now.
So glad to see Byteme running Doom 2016, the most frenetic run i have ever seen, it is just so satisfyimg. good luck Byteme and yes, nightmare difficulty, but apparently that is from the demons perspective :P
Greetings GDQ and Doom community. It's wild to think Doom has oldest speedrunning community out there. So many new tricks and strats that have developed over the last decade, keeping this game fresh and always evolving forward. It's a completely different world than it was back during my own involvement back between 2002 and 2005. Thanks to everyone for keeping one of the most iconic games alive 26 years later. I'll let KingDime pick where this money goes.
This Doom run is simply entrancing to watch.
Had to donate during Doom! My husband used to speed run this game back when it first came out, it's fun to see how much the run has changed since then!
Rip and Tear, until it is done!
First time donating. I love Doom 2016. Samuel Hayden did nothing wrong!

Hi everybody! Resident Neurologist here. I've been catching the events since medical school and want to shout out to everyone who puts in their time, energy, and heart into making these events so fun and memorable. Bye everybody!

All these Doom jokes and not a single doot *sad doot noises*

Love 6102 Wood. Best of luck tearing into Cancer
DOOOOM! aka, one man's quest to out angry hell.
Grew up playing Doom with my dad, he would step in to beat harder levels for me . Who knew the wholesomeness that could attach it self to the act of purging the planet of hellspawn. Thanks GDQ for what you do!
: : : : )
Hey GDQ, I do love this time of year and what better way to stop cancer then fighting it all the way too heck, as the one and only doom guy! Thank you to everyone who is here to help this year. Don't stop being awesome
Bro that invulnerability dive was insane! Shout out to DOOM!!!!!!!!
Man I’ll never get used to the 9000 FPS of DOOM 2016. Great run so far!
Doom (2016) is my favorite fps and I love watching Byteme destroy it in his run. good luck and RIP AND TEAR
Just say hi Luke, Steven, Ryan and Rashid
One simply never have enough DOOM.HONK.
Had to donate after that clutch secret grab as the countdown ended in the Doom run! Great work so far, and I'm definitely going to be tired at work tomorrow staying up for this, but it's worth it for the DOOOOOOM! Put this donation toward's runner's choice.
This run is incredible! March 20th can’t come soon enough so we can Rip and Tear in.....Animal Crossing New Horizons!
HONK AND TEAR, UNTIL IT IS DONE! Donation to runner's choice
Love seeing DOOOOM at GDQ keep up the amazing speedruns.
I had to leave a donation during Doom 2016 if only to share this fun story: I was visiting Italy a few years ago and was wearing a Doom hoodie on the streets of Rome. Some guy walked by me and cheered "DOOOOM!!" as he walked by me in the exact way that the lovely audience members have been doing this evening. Thanks for the awesome run and let's Rip and Tear cancer!
Played this game when it first came out while I was deployed to Afghanistan, very happy to see it Ripped and Torn up at breakneck speed. Super Shotgun OP, but please never nerf!
Always good to see 100% of my favourite series being done. Keep it up!
Hey guys, been watching AGDQ since 2012 and been a blast to watch all the racers. Keep it going.
Is this Halo??
Hey GDQ!Long time watcher, first time donor.I really enjoyed your Star Wars run Muffin, and the poem at the end was so heartwarming. I always enjoy your runs and love this amazing laughs :D Thanks to all the runners for making this event possible!Save the frames!
[e1m1 intensifies]
DOOOOOOOOOOOOM

Honk, rip, and tear. Let's go byte
I loved the any percent runs of Doom, but it's nice to see the game from the inside of the levels for a change.
DOOM has always been my go to shooter game! Been playing since 94, as a six year old. Let's clear Hell out and bring DOOM to Hell!!
Love the run and love this event! Special thanks to my lady for letting me hog the tv! TAKE A BATH DEMONS
Hey Doom Guy, if you happen to find my corpse, be sure to say h-and he’s gone already. Oh well.
Hello to ByteMe and Couch, and a special AYYO to Bryonato. Let's RIP AND TEAR cancer out of the future, one donation at a time. Good speed and RNG for the rest of the week!
Hey doooooooooom :) this is my first donation. My mother got cancer last Christmas so let’s doooooom it. Greetings from Germany ;)
Keep kicking some butt!!!!
"Cancer is stupid. It's about to be stupid and dead."~ DoomGuy, probably
I've always wanted to be able to donate live to this event. This year I actually have been able to watch it live. I was going to wait to for the Mario Block to donate, but this run is absolutely amazing. So much so that I feel the need to donate during both, so here is $100 to DOOOOOOOM cancer!
Been watching GDQ for years and am finally able to attend live. It's great to watch people who know this modern classic inside and out rip and tear it to pieces.
I thought this game was too fast when I plodded my way through it, turns out it requires a super human to take it to the limit that it deserves. I can barely follow what's going on. As it should be. Speaking of super human, 2 players blindfolded on 1 controller in Punch Out? I can't.. even... I just need to go to bed now.
It's like watching ByteMe do ballet, bloody, bloody ballet. With guts. And gore. Ya know, I'd go to the ballet if it were more like DOOOOOOOM!
The run is fantastic and highly entertaining. Happy to donate to research determined to send cancer cells to their DOOM in hell. Have a good night everyone!
Can't help but donate for DOOM
Hey GDQ! I've been watching for a few years and finally decided to donate to some of my favorite games this year. Here's to a great rest of the week.
Hello! This is my first donation! Yall are incredible, this run is Awesome. This event is legendary. Long live GDQ. (Hey announcer, you're doing great!)
Love seeing the Doomslayer at GDQ. Keep it up and rip and tear until cancer is done!
I hear these demons are only angry because some goose wandered in to hell, knocked their hats off and ate their sandwiches!
Dooooooooooom!
Shout out to my wife playing Pokemon on the couch while demons are dying en masse on the big screen. Gotta slay 'em all.
My best friend and roommate beat cancer this year. Donation goes to bloodthunder's choice if he names his top 3 metal albums of 2019
Point and click your Guts!
From the loudest Quake clan in the land... Woo woo woo, YOU KNOW IT! See you at QuakeCon 2020 and keep killing those demons :)
Let's point and click cancer like Byteme point and clicked those demons
Loving the runner and couch commentary for this fantastic DOOM 2016 run. The best FPS in years. This goes to runner's choice!P.S: Hype for Bayonetta coming up!!
CANCER IS HUGE! THAT MEANS IT HAS HUGE GUTS!POINT AND CLICK!POINT AND CLICK YOUR GUTS!
"here I go, killin' again"
Oh how it breaks the evening's gloom,To see Byteme through levels zoom,To see him rip,To see him tear,And conquer the challenge of DOOM.

Hope this is the single donation that pushes us over the edge to beating cancer
My wife introduced me to AGDQ and watching it with her is now is my favorite week every year! She helped me find all the Doom collectibles so this run is extra fun to watch! HONK AND TEAR!
Killer commentary in this Doom run, keep it up guys.
This was one of my favorites games of this decade and I love to see it getting absolutely torn apart for such a great cause, DOOOOOOOOOM!
 (Comment rejected)
Not including Between the Buried and Me or Rivers of Nihil in your 2019 best metal albums. Amateur.
Clearly, Doom 2016 is not only a FPS and Point & Click Adventure...it's clearly a Dating Sim as well! So which weapon are you going to romance? >=)Donation goes to runner's choice.

Point and Click those fists
(In Doom Voice)HOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKK!
(In Demon Voice)On the second day, of the marathon run, when the sun was down, one sat. He chose the path of %100 completion. In his relentless haste, he missed no collectibles, and with boiling blood he scoured the umbral plains seeking to destroy cancer. And those who tasted the bite of his sword named him..... ByteMe.Point and Click until it is done.
First time watching a Doom speed run and couldn't be more impressed. Keep up the good work on Dooooooooom!
Pun for ya. How do you catch Doom Guy? TRIP AND SNARE! Loving the run :)
Just wanted to give the commentator a break for their voice by giving a simple- RIP N TEAR

Hey there tall green and angry, if you keep up this pace my job will be half done before my run starts~ If your up for a little co-op though, I wouldn’t dare separate a man from his shotgun but if you’re interested in chainsaw shoes, hit me up.

Mine eyes can but weep as they bear witness to the majesty... the BFG 9000!As I stride knee deep through the dead, all is clear. I know what must be done. My cause is just... my will is strong... and my gun is very, very large!
POINT AND CLICK MAKE YOU STRONG. POINT AND CLICK GIVE YOU SIXPACK.

RIP AND HONK! RIP AND HONK!
Doomfan from Italy. I promise to that other guy, if I see anyone in a Doom shirt I will yell at them like an insane person. Strappo e demolire (rip and year in italiano)

Loving the stream, let’s prevent cancer!
I thought the point-n-click block was LAST night. But alright, I guess this is basically Myst with guns... right?
The next time someone wants to watch something romantic i will load up a vod of this run and show them the greatest love story of our time.
I have never enjoyed Doom, but this run and especially these people has changed my mind. Keep up the good work!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Well, I had planned to go to sleep, but this Doom 16 run is a rip that keep on tearing.
Absolutely loving this run so had to donate. Great runner, great couch and great commendation by Covert. Point and click , DOOOOOOOOOOM
The video ByteMe was referring to is most likely the one from the Boundary Break series by Shesez. "Out of Bounds Discoveries | DOOM (2016) - Boundary Break"
Greetings from germany. My grandmum survived cancer but my granddad lost the fight. Thank you Byte to rip and tear until cancer is done.
"This is Cobert" the announcer crackered. "You must fight the demons!"So ByteMe gotted his palsma rifle and blew up the wall."HE GOING TO KILL US" said the demons"I will shoot at him" said the cyberdemon and he fired the rocket missiles. ByteMe plasmaed at him and tried to blew him up. But then the ceiling fell and they were trapped and not able to kill."No! I must kill the demons" he shoutedThe announcer said "No, ByteMe. You are the demons"And then ByteMe was a zombie.
Hey there! ID Software QA Here just wanting to thank you for playing DOOM 2016! I Can't wait to watch all the runs in DOOM: Eternal in the future! Oh and I can't forget. RIP AND TEAR! UNTIL IT IS DONE! DOOOOOOOOOM! See you all in March!

Love these Doom speed runs... just didn't know that this game has this much content. <3
I played DOOM last year while recovering from surgery. Laying there high on painkillers trying not to move while everything hurt, Doom really got me through. I played on baby mode, so watching you blaze through on nightmare is mindblowing. Rip and tear, and RIP to cancer!
Sending 9 dollars because I just ordered fast food on mobile, send help.

#DOOMCanByteMe“LETS RIP AND TEAR THROUGH CANCER AND SEND IT BACK TO HELL!!Much respect to Byteme and KingDime and all the runners. GDQ beautiful event and making a difference. Let us all keep changing lives.
All this talk about “rip and tear” is making me really hungry for Monkey Bread. Oh wait - that’s “tear and share.” Ah well. DOOOOOOM!!
This Doom run is so much fun I don't want it to end, but I guess that's not really the point of a speedrun. CLICK AND TEAR
How's your Bane? "Ah you think doom is your ally? You merely adopted the doom. I was born in it, molded by it."
EAST COAST DON'T SLEEP! RIP AND CHEW!

Great event for a great cause; keep up the good work, everyone!
Slam into a RIP AND TEAR! OOOOHHHH YEEEAAAA!
Who knew point and clicks could be so intense?
This run is point and click adventure to a donation. Keep it up! Quick question, what kind of rig are you running to maintain 200 FPS?
I have no idea what's going on, but the commentary on this speed run is by far the most entertaining one I've watched to date.

Loving the runs here, especially the Amid Evil, Doom, and Sonic today! Thanks for the amazing couch commentary! Frick Cancer. Would love to hear more TFG pew pew noises! *quiet honk*
*Sing like the movie*"Yoooooou, Doom-ing that thing you Doooommm"Shout out to the guy in red on the coach for asking all the questions he somehow knew I had while watching. Great way of helping people (like me) learn who have no idea about this game.
RIP AND TEAR!!!! My Roommate and I love watching ADQ everytime it is on!! Thank you for the amazing gameplay and support for Cancer Prevention!
It's the best to start the day with so much fun. :-) Greetings from germany! You're great!
Love watching as much of the GDQ broadcasts as I can! The original Doom was my game of choice growing up, and Quake 2 in college. Glad to watch the Doom run! Quad damage!

(in joker voice) "People run Sonic all day and no one bats an eye, but you start to rip and tear and everyone loses their minds!"
Rip and Click this Point and Tear
I'd like to thank everyone who helps make Games Done Quick happen, but never shows up on camera. As one who knows, it involves a lot of hard work to make everything seem so easy.Byteme: keep fighting all the Clowns of Heck to fight cancer.
Doot your way through heck! Rip and tear cancer!
Another $25 for the Bane, with one more request:*regular voice* That's a big gun*Bane voice* For you.
Hello from Bird School! These runners clearly graduated from our ripping and tearing classes, and we're excited to contribute our first community donation of many this event, going towards the Super Monkey Ball Master run! Shoutout to all the tech, social media, and other behind the scenes crew, you guys rock.
Can we get Chrsitmas song from the crowd. Runners Choice for being fabulously entertaining
This run is making me grip my chair. When we can make it work, we’re making a trip out there.Sitting in the room would take an IV drip for care.Take a sip on a dare. To split food, rip and share.I’ll get in trouble if I keep going at this point (and click.)Poor, but told I need to stop with the puns on our couch.
Rip and tear the cancer, also, trans rights!
I knew I liked Doom, but this run and commentary have been taking things to another level! Keep up the great work, and RIP AND TEEEEARRR!!

#DOOMcanbyteme BYTE Fantastic run, always a pleasure to watch, RIP AND TEAR UNTIL IT IS DONE
I'm finally able to donate for my first AGDQ! Looking forward to all the runs, and Rip and Tear, until it is done!
Staying up late to finish this run. Amazing commentary and fricking cancer is what I live for. I know its GDQ's tenth anniversary, but for me, it's the tenth anniversary of my late boyfriend's cancer diagnosis. Without an amazing community in gaming, I dont know where I would be today.. so thank you guys for fighting the good fight. And can we get a "MARTHA!!" ?
Dashing through those demons like snow.Like a one man machine to slay.Over the corpses we go.Laughing all the way.Rip and Tear.
This Doom run has been the most wholesomely violent speedrun I've had the honor of watching. RIP AND TEAR cancer, fine sirs!
The energy in this run is infectious! Shout out to the crowd for being awesome, the couch for being informative, the runner for absolutely flying through this game and having a blast doing it, and Muffin for being Muffin. RIP AND TEAR!!!
ByteMe, have you been cheating on me with The Gauss Cannon? Siege Mode gets you around faster, but I am as Iconic as the Icon of Sin! We'll have words later in Samuel Hayden's office, when you get done with the RIP AND TEAR
Getting hungry while slaying demons? EAT A PEARRRRRRR
Hey Kap, Worsel from the Bayonetta Speedrun Discord here! Wish I could have been there but good luck with the run and I hope Rodin "stomps the yard" on every attack. Shout-outs to the first runners of this game back on the Wii U who got things started and to everyone watching: if you can't donate be sure to tell others about this event, help spread the word. And remember, Bayo 2 is the best Star Fox game.
What a wonderful Demon-stration of your speed-running skills!
Oh my god I should have been in bed hours ago, but this run is way too good. I'm going to be DOOMED at work tomorrow. Worth it.
Love the speed runs! Keep it up, yet still waiting for point and click adventure part three! Let’s get it done Byteme! Rip and tear!
Happy DOOM Year! We’re all so hyped to see you guys RIP & TEAR through DOOM Eternal! Love you guys!
Man, everything about this DOOM run is awesome. The runner is on point, the couch is great, the audience energy is amazing, and the announcer is funny as heck. Point and Tear! Rip and Click! Wait I think I mixed those up.

Big shoutout to the dancers for keeping things going. Sleep? Who needs sleep when you have DANCE? Dance on, my dudes!
Shout out to the dancers in the front row, keep vibing it up, having fun, and keeping the hype train rolling, you all rock! <3
Is dancing on „next up“ a thing now? Mh „I guess it was nothing.“ tThanks for 10 years of fighting, even if I just got into watching GDQ 3-4 years ago. Have fun everyone! Greetings from Germany.
Hi Sorrel
you gotta dance like bayo for bayo 2
here's to the dummy thicc dance boys
Shoutout to Sock, Ulura. Zeik, Mr Byte and all of the other Discord friendos. We rooting for all of the speedrunners and hoping to prevent the heck out of cancer. GDQ Hype!
I have been watching GDQ for a few years and I am finally in a good place to donate to a great cause during one of my favorite games ever. I can't wait to see how bayonetta 2 will be dominated
First time donating to a GDQ but absolutely had to give to a program which has entertained me for hours. Special props to the people behind the scenes who keep the whole thing running.
Watching my first GDQ with my dad. He says hi to all his friends in the front row!
My grandfather is currently in a battle with cancer and had a tough surgery for it today. I hope one day we can kick cancer’s butt.
Love the energy from the crowd there, clapping and dancing here with you! Big thanks to everyone involved to make this happen!
Here's to our boy Kap, good luck on the run and hopefully this reminds platinum that they announced Bayonetta 3 2 years ago
I always look forward to the Doom speedruns. My mother lost her fight to cancer so I always make it a top commitment to donate so the ripping and tearing of cancer out of this world continues.
Been meaning to do this for awhile, jI would also like to say hi to my friend Corbin
Didnt know they added DDR to the schedule. SmoothOperative you are the best!
Good luck to the runners! Especially during a game that means a lot to me, Bayonetta 2!
Hey there. Back at it again. I fell in love with Bayonetta and immediately got Bayonetta 2 when I got a Switch. Here's to a great run!
I've always loved GDQ and I love the trajectory of the stream. The pronouns warmed my heart!
Hey Kap, it's Art. I'm staying up late to watch your Bayonetta 2 run so that I can wish you good luck in real time. Good luck in real time!
Hey Kap, good luck doing Louie skip Kappa
So glad to see Bayonetta 2 made it this year at GDQ, good luck Kap. Thanks to all the runners and staff to making this event happen. Also don't forget to floss.
Wait, this isn't Pikmin? Just kidding! Congratulations on your first AGDQ appearance, Kap! The Pikmin community is all super proud of you!.
Hello there! Never played any Bayonetta game, but that speedrun sure looks impressive and definitely makes me want to try the game! Good luck!
First time catching you guys live, keep up the good work. To the speedrunners, you are truly amazing! To the crowd, this wouldn’t be so fun watching without you. To the crew behind the cameras, the announcer and everyone else making this possible you are the real MVPS!Hälsningar från Sverige.
Konnichiwa from Tokyo!Really glad to see you playing Bayonetta 2, the best Metroid game ever made.Great character, killer soundtrack, and amazing mechanics. Thanks for streaming it.
Sending love from the front row dance crew. Don’t forget to hydrate!
Let go Bayonetta! Combo kick cancer's butt!
Bayonetta 2 is criminally underrated and one of my favorite speedruns. Im only still awake for this. so please crush it :D
Witch Time = Twitch Prime! Don't forget to sub!
Couldn’t be happier seeing one of my all time favorite games being ran for the first time at AGDQ. Bayonetta 2 is truly a masterpiece and one of best action games ever made. Let’s Dance Boys!
Question for the runner. Is it easier to score better combos on higher difficulties? Will donate another 25 if my donation is read on stream.
Is bayo single or nah
Super excited to see Bayonetta run here, and super glad I'm in a position to donate. Best of luck to the run! Ho Ho Honk!
Much love from the entire Pikmin community. We're right 'behind you' every step of the way. Play good "Kap"tain.
First time donor, long time watcher here! Bayonetta is one of my all time favorite franchises, so what better time to donate? My grandma was diagnosed with cancer around a year ago, and has unfortunately been in a slow decline. I hope no one ever has to go through what she has, so hopefully even this little bit of money will help out.Also, it was Jeanne- the Bayonetta character's- birthday yesterday! Happy birthday, Jeanne! :)

Staying up late to watch this great speed run. Bayonetta 2 is pretty much THE, if not, one of my favorite games of the decade that we just passed.

Love you & love this event.

I've never been able to donate previously, but my family has been crushed by cancer, 4 family members in the last year. I feel I need to do what I can to help out. Thank you to all the runners, you all are amazing. The dancing crew is fantastic.
Glad to see San Andreas get to GDQ! It's one of those games I can never get enough of and play through at least once a year. Follow the train etc. etc.

I'll donate another $15 if you read this out loud for her:"Hemblo, Megan! It is Moon Bun of the Moon! I have snowy white peets and a little pink niffle-nose! You are asleep right now, so Snorlax Bun, Officer Judy Bun, and Emily Bun are having a picnic with me in a lovely Moon Park! We are having chamomile tea, pink lemonade, carrot soup, and strawberry-lemon cake for dessert. You are the best big sister in the world, and Del Bun loves you very very VERY much! Thank you for always being there for him, and for Mister Orange Lump and Bug the Flerken Cat. We'll see you in the morning, Blobs Magician just brought delicious rectangles and Mabel is turning on the karaoke machine!

Just saying "Hi" to my beautiful wife, Tracie. Maybe the comment will be read on the stream. That'd be cool. I'd watch the re-stream and surprise her. She's asleep now. The end.
Save them frames.
It's for charity?! I'm in!

Nice dance moves from that guy in the crowd, also you two guys casting and commenting are 🔥🔥🔥

shout out to my boyfriend who's watching this stream with me across the pond, and also got me into GDQ. stream has great 2a/10am energy right now which is perfect for our terrible sleep schedules. also, wooh trains
KZ cuties are watching, and some of them are probably more stressed than the runner. GL with the run Reset and GL with the commentary.
Fun Fact: James Cameron also partly wrote Terminator 1 and 2. If Michael Bay had any involvement in them we probably wouldn't be talking about them in 2020. Love the run and commentary. P.s. Grand Theft HONK

I'm unable to donate as much as I usually do this year due to the bushfires in Australia, but as I'm Australian and not named Lauren, I guess this has to happen. Thank you to AGDQ for being there to distract and entertain.

Wasn't going to donate again just yet, but as an Australian, I felt I needed to get my HONK in! Big thanks to all the volunteers, runners and of course, donations! Don't worry, I have one person in twitch chat covered, but the rest of you better match the $5.
Bon je fais un don pour aider le meublage!Cette phrase ne sert à rien à part gagner du temps #CoeurNoir
Hey AGDQ loving the speedruns! i took a day off from work today so i can keep watching you guys go at it! keep up the good work and lets kick cancer's butt!!
Merci pour ce rendez-vous annuel ou je vois tous mes jeux préférés se faire pulvériser. Meilleurs casters meilleur tchat. Enjoy !!! Voila le lot que je target => #Parra666 ;(
Is this the line for the Not Australian Not Named Lauren train?
Being sick with the flu for the last few days ain't so bad with GDQ in stream.
I was finally able to take vacation for the entire event and plan to for each one from now on. Maybe I'll have the courage to go to the event eventually but for now I'm happy to just watch.
Greetings from Edinburgh, Scotland, home of Rockstar North. Great to see San Andreas at AGDQ, arguably the best Grand Theft Auto. Nothing beats cruising the countryside while blasting out K-Rose. Honk!
Long time watcher, first time donator!I'm finally in a position to donate after many years watching. Kudos to everyone involved in getting this event together twice a year.I've also had a lot of hassle getting San Andreas running on a modern PC so I can empathise.Stay classy everyone!
There is ups and downs to everything technical difficulties are bad but getting breakfast without missing something of the run is great
I always love watching these old gta runs, the commentary is super fun and the gameplay is incredibly impressive. Greetings from the UK and sorry about the technical issues.
Keep up the good work GDQ. Let's do our best to beat Cancer!
greeting from england love the work you all do, keep it up!this is my first donation and won't be my last
Finally getting a chance to donate to GDQ, Glad GTASA is back up and running. Dono goes to announcers choice. Also, Honk!
Love this event. Much Love from Sweden
for excellent cometary from player and couch very entertaining
When you spend more time with farm animals than with your wife, you'll get a lonely heart. And a nasty infection.K-Rose has a special place in my heart. Not entirely sure if it's for the right reasons, but shush.
I heard all I had to do was follow the train, so here I am! Thanks for the run.
I'm just here to give money to tired people playing video games to beat cancer
San Andreas country music Karaoke? I'm all for it! "All my ex-es come from Texas!"
Here's $25 for a K Rose sing-along from the couch! You could say that's never happened before
I'll donate another $10 if you do a duet for whatever K-Rose song is playing at the time this dono is read out.
Stop honking! I'm trying to sleep. Greetings from Poland. HONK!
St Andreas country music karaoke? I'm all for it, cos all my ex-es come from Texas.
This event really hit home for me. My mother died Thanksgiving morning after a 20 year battle with leukemia. I always donate during GDQ, but this time I'm doing it because I have a new reason to believe in the cause. Thank you all for doing this. Donation goes to Enigma's choice.

Making my first donation during my first time catching a live run. Loving San Andreas so far, and I’m super excited to see the rest of the awesome runs! Best of luck to all the runners, and thanks to the GDQ staff and organizers for putting this on year after year. Let’s send cancer up in (Big) Smoke!
Loving that van. Love GTA even though I feel my teenager will drive like that. I lost my grandmother to cancer so it's an honor to donate to a wonderful cause.
Un grand bravo aux speedrunners, à toute l'équipe américaine et française de se relayer nuits et jours.Etant atteinte d'une maladie génétique orpheline (Syndrome Ehlers-Danlos) et en fauteuil roulant, je ne peux qu'adhérer à ce genre d'initiative. Il y a des choses importantes dont on ne parle que trop peu et où quasi zéro moyens ne sont mis en place.Un magnifique évènement pour une magnifique cause.Love u all.#MarioLight

Hey GDQ ! So happy we got to this time of the year again !I enjoy a long lunch break to watch an hour and a half of this great run and make my first donation.I won't be able to watch as much live as I want this year because of my job, but at least I can top my usual donation amount !Good luck Reset, and good GDQ to everybody!
Did you know? All skeletons have epilepsy. This doesn't make sense, since they don't have eyes... Or brains. Nonetheless your warnings are appreciated. The skeletons will spare you for now. Incentive is Enigma's choice.
Greetings from Germany. First time donor. My dad managed to beat throat cancer a few years ago. Let's kick cancers butt. Good luck to all the runners and let's bingo a million before the weekend! Donation goes to the cats choice.
Took me like 3 months playing on and off to get through flight school the 1st time :/ New to GDQ but really enjoying the run so far
Great show, guys! Best of luck :)
Hey Reset, cineQ here, remember to use the gun in heli to destroy targets Kappa good luck with the rest of the run man

Shout out to my mom who recently got diagnosed with cancer, thank you to everyone fighting to end it
Just a reminder that we still appreciate you for warning us about the epilepsy triggers. Watching this run brings back so many memories. I don't think I have ever played a game that felt as big as San Andreas. Greetings from Denmark.
You're both wrong, Urban Yeti is the best Grand Theft Auto game!Joking though, love the run!
this plane section is giving me flashbacks to superman 64. i'm not sure if i should be grateful for that fact. enjoying the run so far though! also enjoying the velvety tones of coach's magnificent hosting!

Thanks for running GTA San Andreas; this game is awesome! Totally worth waking up early for. Keep kicking cancer where it hurts.
Great run great cause!
Honestly this run is perfect to listen to and sometimes sneakily peek onto while at work. My colleague already wonders why I keep headbobbing randomly :) The music is great and watching takes me back to a great time during my adolescence. Shoutout to both the runner and the guy on the couch. You are doing an AMAZING job.
keep up the good work
I love AGDQ. There have been hundreds of donations saying, "What a great cause!", but it really is. Cancer is responsible for just under 50% of human deaths, but survival rates have suddenly increased over the past 50 years. That's down to a better understanding of cancer pathology, a better understanding that ultimately relies on money. Thank you to all the runners, organizers, and donaters.
The lawless movie you meant is "The Purge". I think.Honk from Germany
Thanks for noticing us, senpai!
Informational message for the lawless movie. It's called The Purge. Incentive to runners choice.
OMG he is playing for over 3h, time for a 20 min break.
Good marathon & good luck, from France.
Let's kick cancer's a... butt GDQ. Can I get a HYYYYYPE? Also, let's get that Blindfolded Punchout incentive!!

Hey couch guy, the movie you said is The Purge. First time donator!!! Thanks to Reset I will finally see the rest of the game I didn't finish in my childhood, what an amazing run, like a manly man. All I wanted to do was follow the donation train.
300k hype! Never played San Andreas but this run is amazing!
Giving my morning coffee money before I head out to work, love what you all are doing and let’s have a great day :)

Had to donate and recognize the skill required to speedrun a game while balancing a sombrero on your headset.
Eagle Island is one of my favorite games of 2019. Super excited to see it during AGDQ. Good luck on the run!

This is my first time being able to donate during a live stream. We lost my father-in-law to brain cancer shortly after getting married so being able to donate means alot to us. Thank you for saving those frames for the cure!
Such a great time watching ADGQ every year. This year is no exception! Runners like MrDino are a pleasure to watch, I love hearing about the strats and communities around each game. Good luck on the run and let's get cancer done quick!
I've had Eagle Island on my wishlist for a while, love to see it run at GDQ. Shoutouts to the Mexican speedrunning community from Arizona! Howdy neighbors!
just wanna get into some of those prizes for this block, sorry no witty comment here
Donating for the awesome sombreros. Way to add flair to an already-awesome run!
Honk
Had to do my part.
I always look forward to GDQ and donate each year, but this year I donate in the name of a friends dad who passed away to cancer just before newyear.
Amazing run so far. It's been a HOOT. I hope the dev PixelNicks can add sombreros to the game. Especially a tiny one for Koji.
Great run so far, MrDino! You have my support!
That owl-eagle pun made me put down my pudding. I hope you're happy.
GDQ never ceases to make our week so much better. The commentary and community is the best. Best luck to all the racers! HONK
Hey GDQ, love to see this awesome Event. Good Luck to the Runners and Greetings from Germany. :D
This game looks like so much fun! And that owl eagle joke was really good!
Long time watcher and fan of the GDQ event series. This is my first time donating to the event. Good luck to all the runners at GDQ. Hope may the RNG be in your favor and may cancer be defeated soon!
Thank you Dino for this run. One of the best parts of GDQ is getting introduced to tons of amazing games one might not have heard of otherwise, and getting a glimpse of their passionate and lovely communities. Best of luck going forward!
Good luck!
Hey MrDino, glad I was able to wake up in time to catch most of your run. Never heard of this game before, but you make it look like a lot of fun, so I’m going to have to check it out. Thanks for the great run!
Hey AGDQ! I'm currently going through exams for uni, with the next one being Molecular Biologie this friday. We learn a lot about cancer and the origin of it, so I thought I had to donate to this good cause and do my part. Good luck with the runs everybody! Will be watching during my breaks from studying!
Always nice to watch AGDQ and an awsome way to see new games and how good some people are at them
MrDino making this look so smooth, good luck on the run and let's beat cancer
This is an amazing run and a cool game! Love the sombreros!Also - 300k HYPE!!!
Looking forward to the Final Fantasy 8 run hours from now! Putting this money towards “Vriska” as Rinoa’s name!
Super cute game and super good run. And the puns are owlright! :D

Paying my respects to MrDino both for showing off this lovely game and for setting a world record at GDQ! I remember when we used to be spoiled by many such records each marathon, but it's all the more impressive to set one now things are so competitive. Congratulations!

Second dono on the third day of this awesome event! I appreciate all that GDQ and the runners do for our community as well as for those who are fighting cancer right now. Let's keep it up!
First of many donations this week. Two of my aunts were recently diagnosed with cancer, one of whom just passed away. Thanks to all the runners and everyone who helps with A/V, setup, and anything else at GDQ. You're all doing very meaningful work to contribute to a noble cause. Good luck to all the runners!

So rarely do you see a movie tie-in game that's clearly better than its movie, love this game so much, glad Codepiece is here running it!
Hey, another game where the runner needs some Rat-away? Good luck on the run and watch out for zombies!
That world record run was amazing! There were some heron-raising close calls, but MrDino made owl the right plays, and after some eagle-eyed shots he made it through! I could keep raven about that run for a while, but I'd better stop before it gets hawkward. Amazing run, and keep up the great work! Donation goes to host's choice.

Had to donate during my favourite game (Hotline Miami). So sad that the speedrun means we get less of the amazing soundtrack though.Also wanted to remind everyone that it doesn't have to be a big donation to do good in the world! So Toss your Runner a coin, oh Twitch Chat OOOoOohhh oh Twitch Chat OOoOoohhh
This is my first time actually watching GDQ and it's amazing to see all the runners with all their tricks and just breezing past all these levels... but most importantly, that everyone can get together and donate to charity. Happy new year everyone!
I played Hotline Miami to 100% on a trackpad with no lock on, and loved every second of it! Good luck on the run!
Here’s for an awesome Mummy run and an awesome Hotline run!
Hey Snow,I had to donate during your run. Glad to see you are doing well, please choose where this donation goes.
Second year watching GDQ, amazing content as always. Thanks too all the staff and runners for putting on a great show and supporting a cause that's close to my heart. Also, that Hollow Knight Print is amazing. I'm going to need one.

Hey can we get a shoutout to the people wearing the pipopipo helmets in the background of the Hotline Miami run? No reason just glad to see people representing Ape Escape this year without a Ape Escape run
Is it just me...or is this game a tiny bit confusing and strange?
The comment reads: Not Intuitive gives a 1 dollar donation with no comment

Thanks to all the staff, volunteers, runners, attendees, and donors that make GDQ what it is!
There are times when life piles on us, and we can become surrounded in negativity and grief. We wish that none of it had happened.Remember the wise words of Gandalf when Frodo made the same wish-"and so do all who live to see such times. But that is not for them to decide. All we have to decide is what to do with the time that is given to us.”
Had to donate during theboyks' run! This event has been absolutely "ribbit-ing." Now, hop to it, and let's make cancer "croak"!

All I can say is that I really love frogs

So excited to see TheBoyks at AGDQ. He is truely my favorite speed runner. Just wondering, since this might be my only opportunity to tell him something special. I was just wondering if you could tell him this special message: Hey.
Hey the_boyks! Good luck on your run and have fun at AGDQ for me!
Hip hey
I bought a pet bird but it keeps getting itself suck on fabric, I think it might be a vel-crow
These runners make the games look to easy, so I vote we make it harder for them. Let's go Super Castlevania IV Hard Mode!
Excited to see TheBoyks running Croaktel! Thanks for getting me interested in speedrunning all those years ago, and leapfrog to rapid victory!
Shout out to the man, the myth, the legend, TBCR over on the couch! Wattup buddy!
Hi AGDQ community!I've been following you since 2013, and it's now for me an event as important as Christmas or summer holidays :)As many of us, I have too many many members of my family or friends that have been hit by cancer. This event is such a good opportunity to remember how much prevention can avoid this horrible disease.You all guys rock, keep up the amazing job, I can't wait to see cancer disappear once for all, I can't wait either to see the MegaMan relay run :)Cheers from France, a big up to the LeFrenchRestream community and HYPE !!!#GDQup

First time donating. I'll try to donate for each of my patients who are battling cancer. This first one however is for TUEN to support his bid for Pokemon name. He wanted to break the record for the first 100k raised (a true speedrunner). Next one lets crush that record!
Keep up the good work!
This is for my boyfriend who is at home watching instead of at work because he's "sick".
Merci à tous les ambianceurs et commentateurs comme d'habitude. Excellente AGDQ à toutes et tous ! #GDQup PS: Tristesse pour Sekiro mais coeur sur le runner
My card got frauded last Friday so I was worried I wouldn't be able to donate! Thankfully my bank has pulled through and I can, so here's $25 to some awesome runners running a hard as heck game!
MAHMAN proud of ya on the GDQ stage!
Thank you so much to GDQ and all the runners. Save the frames, save the humans.
I unfortunately won't be around to watch the sapphire run but I had to donate for my favorite game.
Honk!
Huge thanks to all of you for getting this together for a great cause! Can't wait for the Castlevania run later, let's kick this towards making that a little bit harder.

First time donating and I just had to add to the Sapphire Wingull name incentive as Sapphire was my first Pokémon game.
Two players on one controller for Mike Tyson's Punch Out, BLINDFOLDED???Impossible! I HAVE to see this!
Watch speedruns, beat cancer.

Here's my contribution to the fight against cancer for this year's AGDQ and to hoping that we can find a way to treat every kind of cancer out there.
Shoutout to GDQ and all the Runners for making my boring work day much more interesting!
Shout-out to the whole GDQ crew from us over at Desert Bus For Hope! We love y'all!! HONK <3
I just noticed all the prizes, could not resist donating again :-O
Five more hours to hit Punch out? Come on guys we can do it!
Thank you for the great effort you put every year to deliver one of the best events. Good luck to the speedrunners and let's beat the Cancer together!
I think I've donated to every GDQ since a couple of years ago, so here's to another successful GDQ. Also I need those Eevee pins, they're SOOOO CUTE! (° A °)

Hello from the front row! Great event so far, but it could be better if we got that Punch Out run!
Keep being awesome
This event is amazing. Thanks to all who make it possible!
Where's the ref? Cancer clearly has committed a foul play and needs a red card
Castlevania should always be in hard mode.
Oh dang those Eeveelution crotchets are cute as heck! And that hat! And that poster! Take my money!Super excited about that Tyson run, lets get that met.
Cancer is an Omega Weapon. Here's to fighting and Defeating Omega Weapon.
Hi there GDQ!Thank you for these ten years, and hopefully many more ahead!Awesome work everyone, keep it up!And guys, we need to see that Punch-Out run here later! Hype!
I have to donate during Lolo, been a huge fan of the series since I was a kid, thanks for running this amazing game!
Most kids in the early 90s were introduced to the NES with a Mario game. Me? My first game was Adventures of Lolo. It is now 2020.... and not gonna lie... I don't think I can remember ever beating this game. So show me how it's done, and let's fight cancer at the same time!
orb?
Petit don habituel contre le cancer. Moi l'ayant vaincu l'été dernier, ce combat représente plus pour moi maintenant. Qu'un jour cette saloperie puisse disparaître !!#Goupix
Greetings from Czech Republic! Adventures of Lolo was my first NES game I've ever played. It's awesome to see it at GDQ! Good luck and have fun!
I love this game and used to play it all the time. I’m so surprised and excited to see it at GDQ! Good luck on the run!!
I'm going to need to go to work, and miss so many great runs. Looking forward to catching everything in the vods, if that goose doesn't run off with them.

Hello GDQ. My first time donating. I recently lost an aunt to cancer. A good friend of mine also had a friend just diagnosed not too long ago. I'm tired of cancer taking those who are important to us so let us all band together to punch cancer in the face. Speaking of punching. How bout a donation train to the punch-out run? More runs equals more donation chances and that run is one you don't want to miss!!! Good luck to the runners and thank you to the staff and tech team for making these possible.
Love Adventures of Lolo! Can't wait to see it beat, because I never could...
Have to donate for those pokemon cross stitches. I'm sure my fiance Jennifer would love having those around. Also hi Meg and crew.
I've been watching GDQ events for a couple years, and I'm always impressed with the amount of work that goes into these events. I've vonly ever been indirectly affected by cancer, but i know how important research is to find a cure. Put this towards host's choice please.....aHONK
Premier AGDQ que je peux suivre, vraiment une super ambiance et une cause qui vaut nos dons ! Merci à vous pour la qualitay du stream FR ! #ConseilDes4

Happy AGDQ runners! This donation is from my brother and I. Our grandmother beat breast cancer a little over a year ago thanks to early detection, and seeing all these games get destroyed for such a good cause brings us joy! May your runs be fast~

I love video games and think cancer is hot garbage. Here's to a great week! Let's break some records!
Adventure Island II is one of my favourite childhood games, so many great memories! I replayed it over and over again during 90s in Poland and I had a Polish version of NES (gray-coloured 'Pegasus' TV console). Mexican Runner, thank you so much for bringing it to AGDQ! Let’s fight cancer together.
Shoutout to Sorrel the dancing rockruff & co! It makes me sad that people online can't enjoy everyone's dancing spirit. Keep up the good work in entertaining us all at home!!

Thanks for all the good you, the sheerly massive amounts of positivity created by this event is amazing and uplifting.
Shout out to all the groovy dancers in the front row. You are all beautiful humans.
Got to see that Punch-Out run. How can it even be possible?
Shout outs to Cartridge Blowers (hey, that's me! (that's just written in the comment)), been watching GDQs for years, but this is the first time I've actually been able to donate. Looking forward to all of the great runs this week!
Sad I won't be able to watch the Pokemon Speedrun because of work tonight but glad I got to watch some great games before work!
Had to donate during NES block with all of these amazing runs! We're so close to the Super Castlevania incentive! Let's honk our way to some more difficult orbs!
This event is Great! keep it up guys!
Save the frmaes
Putting my money down for the punchout run. Last year's run of punch out Wii blew my mind. I'm ready to be mind blown again and everyone else should be too.
First time watching AGDQ live, huge respect for all the runners and organisers for coming together for such a good cause. Let’s see that Castlevania hard run!
As the proud owner of many geese, hearing these honks warms my heart.
Gyarados hat?! Give it to me. Also, HARD MODE!!! Do it!
25 more for a honking good time!
I love myself some Adventure Island 2. The best part is that you might think there are only 2 Adventure Islands, but there are actually 8! That's 4 times the amount of islands you expect! Great value and great game, good luck with the run.
Shoutout to Lobster and the speedpals from your friend Johnny 5 Aces! Donation goes to that crazy punchout incentive!
TMR! TMR! TMR! TMR! TMR! TMR! TMR! TMR! TMR!
always a pleasure to watch AGDQ and especially TMR <3
I got my long-time username from Final Fantasy 8, so I'm going to return the favor and put this donation towards a character in the Final Fantasy 8 speedrun! Let's go, Vriska!
Definitly enjoyed most of the awsome speedruns so far.Also cant wait for pokemon saphire.Best generation with best starters.Good luck too all runners
T M R - Beat the game!
Hey there, here to donate from the Netherlands in name of both myself and my Florida based friend Christina. Been watching GDQ for a long time, but this year is the first year I'm watching all of it together with a friend through the power of the internet. One day we hope to attend the event in Orlando, but till then this has to do. And to Christina, if you are hearing this, thank you for watching this with me! GDQ, let's prevent cancer. Everyone there is AWESOME!
Shout out to my compadre TMR and the best of lucks in this run. I am so glad to see Adventure Island II in GDQ, one of my childhood games. Little trivia: Did you know that Master Higgins (our main character in this game) is known as Capulinita in Mexico because of his resemblance with a late comedy actor named Capulina?. Greetings from Mexico! NO MAMES!
Ten years of GDQ means ten years of me making this donation comment, but it's as true now as it was in 2010 - NES. BLOCK. IS. THE. BEST. BLOCK!!Great luck to all the runners. And shout outs to Cart and Sooraya giving us ALL the fantastic comments!
Wanted to throw my donation in for one of my favorite games when I was growing up. I used to play adventure island 1 and 2 on my parents NES. Both of my Grandmothers are breast cancer survivors, many arent that lucky, so donating to the Prevent Cancer Foundation to make sure that no one else has to go through it is a very worthier cause. Good luck to TheMexicanRunner and all other runners this week.
Here's to watching AGDQ in sunny (I'm assuming sunny because of TMR's sunglasses) Florida. Hope you're enjoying that weather instead of the snow that the DC area is getting now. Donation goes to Punchout because the 2014 run of it was what got me interested in speedruns. Good luck, everyone! And thanks to the tech team. :)
Honk, but in a menacing, suggestive way.Suggestive meaning plotting to steal Spike's badge again
LETS GOO
Adventure Island II? With the soothing voice of TheMexicanRunner? Yes please, best run so far. I'm sad I won't be up for Pokemon Saphire, I'll have to catch up with the VoDs later. Greetings from France.
long time watcher first time donate, keep it going boys
Cancer touches everyone and doesn’t discriminate let’s knock it out together, from Fizz, Chlorhexidan, and Soverieghn!! Good luck and game on!!! Let’s get that bonus game!!!
Hey TMR, good luck on your run! Remember, hardcore gaming is the only way. Also, no mames!
Cheers to the best week in gaming!
Wanting to donate for the Lolo perlers!!!
Don't think for a second that I've forgotten TMR's blindfolded Battletoads speeder bike run. That was nuts! TMR FOR PRESIDENT
Hey TMR! I watch you every time you are at AGDQ and Adventure Island 2 is a favorite of mine. As a kid I learned the code to world select: left, right, left, right A, B, A, B but starting on the last world with no items is terrible! Ha e you tried it?
Go TMR!
Did TMR just redefine Marathon Strats?
I added a "pan" to this comment for all the scary moments of the run.
I was a game tester all through the 8 and 16-bit eras and TheMexicanRunner is a true king. I know the stress that man's thumbs go through, and I salute you, sir.Press B to jump and knock out cancer!
TMR is my favorite speed runner and look forward to seeing him at each GDQ!
Always great to see TMR running at AGDQ.
The true Famicom was the family you met along the way!This donation goes towards a great run for Adef and towards naming Kyogre "Rainbow Whale." Break a leg, Clay!
I don't have anything funny or interesting to say, but I didn't want to leave it blank.
im half asleep at work because i stayed up too late watching gta san andreas heres 10 bucks as thanks
Let's get that Punch Out run! Hype!
FOr a good cause, dad is fighting cancer second time as we speak. So why not help stopping it!
I just had to donate for TMR (and those Pokemon prizes). Loving the runs so far and I'll be watching all week for everything going down.
HONK, HONK! The goose caboose is on the loose!!
Where were we on that’s Super Castlevania IV hard mode train? Here’s 15 more dollars so my peoples attending the event can watch one of my favorite games live and harder than I could handle! #honkitup
First time that I can donate! Been watching for three years now. Absolutely love watching the speedruns, and for a great cause! Love everyone that are involved. HONK!
Hype!
Good luck to Adef on his Hebereke run. Sad I could not be there to race against him but I'm confident he will crush the game on his own. Shoutouts to the NES community. Love you guys!
Hilarious and entertaining run as always by TMR. Keep up the great work everybody.
Seems like TMR may of beat this before 🤔
C'est réparé? Je peux faire un don? Courage à tous ♥

Awesome runs, awesome work, awesome crowd! You guys put the AAAAAAAYYY in AGDQ!Keep smiling, guys!
Thank you AGDQ!
Each Eeveelution is best Eeveelution.
hype for honk orbs
Can we get a 10 dollar donation train going for Blindfolded Punch Out? I’ll donate 10 more dollars if we can make it happen!
Wait, we can make Castlevania harder? Let's make it happen!
Shout out to my pal Eirik in Norway who is a big fan of Hebereke! And to Adef for running the game! Let's beat cancer!
WOOOOOOOO! AGDQ Time,Gaming is a big bart of my life so I'm really happy to support for all. Greting from Poland
Wishing all the best of luck to my lil-bro-adjacent Adef as he crushes Hebereke! Always nice to hang out with ya here at home and excited to see you on the stage again. Happy to keep donating to the amazing cancer fighting cause too, keep up the solid work all!
Greetings from the UK! Loving Dance Dad and his troupe of dancers on the front row; makes me smile between games! Keep it up!
Let's get some Punch-Out on the menu, please!
My wife met someone with stage 4 cancer today in line at the grocery market. She texted me about it while I was watching GDQ. Felt like a sign that it was time to donate. Thanks for such an amazing event and great cause. Good luck to all the runners!
MTPO and Ninja Gaiden II are the games which brought me into this wonderful community. Lets get that blindfolded run met, you won't regret it
Shooting a donation because Brossentia needs to be a part of Super Hydlide
Gotta get that Punch-Out incentive met. Runs today have been great, and I'm super hyped for what else is on the lineup for this event!
Too many of my friends and family have been taken by cancer over the years, and it's about time we put an end to it before it starts. Donation goes to blindfolded 2p1c Punch Out because any time Zallard and Sinister take the stage it's amazing. Let's continue the magic.
Hoping we can get to the point that no one has to lose a family member or loved one to cancer ever again. I love GDQ, and the Prevent Cancer Foundation is a great cause to donate. Also, let's see that Punch Out run!
I am here to kick butts and donate!And I'm all outta butts!keep up the good work, a real pleasure seeing so many games run for such a great cause!
Hi from Australia. With all the fires going on over here, i could only help with this little bit. My dad was diagnosed with cancer late last year and i hope with more events like this, we can defeat the monster that is cancer!
Hey AGDQ! Having had a grandmother survive breast cancer due to early detection, I am forever grateful for programs like the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and wish to see them continue their work.
Here is 10 more dollars to Castlevania hard mode
Just wanted to donate. Nice work on the runs everyone!Greetings from Norway
Alright twitch chat, I'm calling us out. I see over 100,000 people watching and we still have incentive's not met? Time to jump on the 5 dollar train here!
Thanks for all the entertainment GDQ. Love to all
Greetings from HONK, long time HONKER and I've been watching AGDQ for two honks now. Love what you're doing!! Honk from Seattle :)
Mike Tython's Punth Out? With two playerth and one controller?? Thign me up!Thank you for a great stream once again and much love from Finland.
What happens when two legends of blind-folded PUNCH-OUT play on one controller? I need to know! Sooraya host hype!
Been watching for years so it's time to donate! Always a great cause, runs are always amazing, and the prizes are just icing on the cake. Good luck to all the runners!!!
Always good to hear Sooraya on the mic. Wish I could be there in person but I'm spending time with my newborn daughter Marnie, which I think would also be a great name for a Wingull. Does that make me a member of Team Yell?
#YomiCeleste
Pokemon Block HYPE
Seriously. 2 players. 1 controller. No Eyes.
Gotta see that Punch-Out run!
Hey all. Yetee here. Had to donate after some of our favorite NES titles. Between the clutch LOLO and Adventure Island 2 runs our eyeballs are almost popping out of our heads! Speaking of that, Good Luck to Adef on their Hebereke run!
'sup all, Kenny here with greetings from Sweden. Had to get one in during my OG speedgame Ufouria. Somehow, my recorded on VHS 41:40 any% from 2005 is still up on SDA. What's up with that? Happy 10th anniversary to Games Done Quick and an extra special shoutout to UraniumAnchor.
All in all, this is such a great event.Doing this whole thing for a good cause is truly inspiring.Everyone has so many other obligations in their live, but we're all here anyway.Fighting cancer.So many people are here, and donating too!Most people probably don't even know that this event exists.Even so, this gets put on twice a year, and so much money is raised for a great cause.Let's keeps donating.Let's keep raising money.Some good luck to adef as well!now read the first letter of each sentence
I can't give much this year, but sending my love to everyone working AGDQ. This is in honor of my mom, a cancer survivor and my biggest hero. Donation toward that blindfolded co-op punch out!
Good luck adef, from an occasional Ufouria runner. Put the money to runner's choice.
I need to see 2 players blindfolded while playing Mike Tyson's Punch out! Let's meet that incentive. I also ❤️ Eevee! Honk!
$20 for one of my favorite games . Punch Out
First time catching a GDQ. Really enjoying it and as a budding medic I'll definitely be donating and spreading the word. Good Luck to all the runners!
Seeing one of my favorite games run at a GDQ is a pretty good birthday gift and made even better when my old speedrun buddy is running it, gl Adef! Do it for Norway.
this one’s for my childhood friend Paula who is currently battling brain cancer. gotta go quick!
Here's a perfect donation for a perfect run.
let's get a $5 donation train for the hard mode Castlevania
Thanks to all three runners. I'm at work while most of this run is going on, so I don't know if I'll be able to watch you guys live, but here's a small contribution towards putting that blindfold on Luz', because Muttski's mom needs to see her favorite speedrunner do his magic once again :)
Vous êtes tous des belles personnes ! #ConseilDes4

My name is Jennifer, but I am not a frog. I'm a 38-year-old with metastatic breast cancer. Enjoying this perfect GDQ run is helping me take my mind off things, and donating what I can is helping make stories like mine more rare. Donation goes toward Mike Tyson's Punch Out, one of the first video games I ever played.
You're doing the right thing. Thank u <3
Hello from Norway! The sister of a friend of mine recently learned that she has early stage cancer and will begin treatment later this week. Donating to help others in similar situations, since early detection is like discovering an out of bounds glitch, enabling you to reach and defeat the end boss faster.Also: HONK!
I woke up sick today, but I'm glad that I have GDQ around to help me feel better. Good luck to all of the runners!
What the honk am I watching, this is great! Really enjoying this run!
Hello there,I just got a call that somebody turned on a sink, and it flooded a whole game. Tnx for the job man! With this I'll be able to buy a new vacuum for my brother.Much love to ADEF, awesome run!
We absolutely need more PunchOut!! If you've never seen what they're about to attempt, I promise it's worth your five bucks.
This is for a special someone on the couch:(song by Seal - Kiss from a Rose)"Baby, I compare you to a kiss from a rose on the greyOoh, the more I get of you, the stranger it feels, yeahNow that your rose is in bloomA light hits the gloom on the grey"I will donate additional 50$ if the Announcer sings it and another additional 50$ if Patty actually sings it.I love GDQ for everything it does; the runs, the audience, the runners and of course twitch chat! It is one of my favourite times in the year when watch a GDQ event live on twitch!Good luck with the runs, bless RNG and lets donate cancer away!Germany from greetings... i mean... Greemany from gertings... uhm you know what i mean!
Thank you to everyone who makes this event possible for such a great cause! Happy new year to everyone watching and participating in this wonderful event! <3
PlusUltra !!!
I don't know who this "adef" guy is but he's pretty cool
Prendre un verre avec les collègues, leur annoncer que tu as posé le reste de la semaine, et rentrer comme un prince te mettre devant le restream FR : la vie, c'est avant tout des petits plaisirs.Un grand merci au French Restream pour ce taff fantastique comme toujours. #donnezbourré

Loving AGDQ 2020 and this Hebereke run in particular — the animations are so cute! Put this towards Punch Out, this is a run we can’t afford to miss.
Super slide!
The runner's charisma is winning me over, good run, man, and good work on the guy holding that sign for so long too
ADEF is doing an awesome job at entertaining! I love it when the runners put on such a great show!
Shout outs to the guy in the Rock-Ruff Hat. Keep on making things awesome.
I have lost family members and pets to cancer and I have people in my life who are cancer survivors. Thank you so much to everyone at GDQ for raising money for such a great cause! This event helped me a lot last year while I was dealing with the death of my cat, so I'm glad I'm in a position where I can donate a bit this year to help out
Come on everybody let's meet that punchout incentive! I propose a 5 dollar donation train, starting NOW! HYPPPEEEE (goongetdatboi)
We need to see that 2p1c Mike Tyson's Punch-Out blindfolded run!! Let's go! :)

It's my 26th birthday, and what better way to celebrate than to sit back and watch one of my favorite weeks of the year? Absolutely loving the event so far this year. Donation goes to FFVIII blind menuing. Always awesome seeing big JRPG menuing sections done out of pure muscle memory.

Let's get that Punch-Out run!
My husband and I watch GDQ every year. He introduced me to GDQ and every time it comes around I am reminded of so many happy memories. Thanks for everything you guys do. I'm so glad I finally have the money to give back this year.
HONK!! My girlfriend loves you guys, Free hugs for everyone watching!I love the hat in the crowd, you know who you are.
Come on Sent, multiple world theory is very simple. But before we can get into multiple worlds, first we have to define what exactly an A press is...
Love you guys so much, it's heartwarming to see all the people donate!!!!
Love watching GDQ and donating to a great cause. Good luck to all the runners and a HYPE for all the great announcers and people behind the scenes keeping everything going. Lets get this amazing punchout run!
2 Player 1 Controller Blindfolded Punch-Out? Let's do this! Shout-out to the AGDQ crew and runners this year for putting on a great show, as usual.
3rd donation this week, going towards that Punchout run, we need to see it, even if the runners won't!
Making up for not being able to donate last night. I will always donate for more GDQ. Donation goes to Punch-Out.
That run was ALMOST perfect, but it was missing just a few things: Honk! Orb! Hype!
<3 HONK HONK
MAGfest followed by AGDQ is the toughest possible thing for my sleep, but I must power through!
Did I hear that correctly? 2p1c blindfolded punchout? That sounds completely random, crazy and like an absolute must watch. Sign me up! All of you are doing an awesome job on a regular basis to ensure that charities that are in desperate need of money to help the people get said money to continue what they're doing. I'm happy to be able to help twice a year. Keep it up! And good luck to all runners that are yet to have their runs shown.
HONK!
Orb! I mean Honk! I mean... Horb? The memes are mutating too fast for me to keep up with. Donating toward Punch Out -- they won't be able to see it, but I sure want to!

For my husband whom enjoys watching gdq, and is a double cancer survivor.

<3
Had to donate when I saw the Pokemon cross stitch. Hands down the prize with the most hours invested into it.
Donating during one of my favorite games of all time, Ninja Gaiden 2. Obligatory long time watcher, first time donator comment. This game was one of the first I ever tried to speedrun. I switched when I realized that this game is so darn optimized that it's probably going to be over by the time I even finished typing out this donation. I'm definitely not mad about it. Let's kick cancer's butt!P.S.Here's a little known bit of trivia about Ninja Gaiden 2; it has tons of OOOOOORRRRBBBSSSS!!!
Donating because I can not get enough water in my life and had to donate during the Pokemon Sapphire block.Drink water folks.
💖💖💖
First time donating and hoping to get that awesome hat for all the gaming conventions coming up this year! Kick cancer's butt!
Hey everybody, I love what you guys are doing keep up the great work?!

Happy to witness yet another GDQ, good luck to all the runners!

I still have fond memories of going to the store for my older brother and I to pick up our brand new copies of Ruby and Sapphire. Can't wait to watch a game that means so much to me get destroyed. Putting this toward the Punch-Out run!
Lets get that Mike Tyson's punch out incentive knocked out!
MTP 2P1C! THAT'S THE ONLY RUN FOR ME!
This donation is in honor of my mother who lost her battle with cancer 15 years ago, and to my buddy who was just diagnosed with testicular cancer and is recovering from surgery. Thank you to all who donate and thanks to GDQ for these wonderful events twice a year!
My mom has been losing her battle with cancer and it's been really hard to deal with lately. Hope one day we can stop this horrible disease.
I have no idea how they're going to do Punch-Out 2p1c AND blindfolded, but i MUST see it (even if the players can't)!
Please keep delaying the zelda series run so I can watch it when I wake up tomorrow ! Good luck for the FFVIII runners, and the commentators from each restream, stay hydrated for this long run, you'll need your throat !___________________________________________________________S'il vous plait, continuez à retarder la run des zelda que je puisse la regarder en me levant demain matin !Bonne chance aux runners de FFVIII, et aux commentateurs de chaque restream, hydratez vous pour cette longue run, vous aurez besoin de votre gorge !#zhtSonic

Greetings from Canada! Been watching GDQ since 2011, got my wife into it when we got married in 2014 and now we both watch - This year for the first time I took the week off to catch runs that would otherwise be happening when I was "at work" or "sleeping" or some other such nonsense.
It's that time of year again, another donation during my favorite gaming event of the year.
This is for my husband's grandfather, who struggled with bone cancer for over a decade. It was thanks to the wonderful doctors and nurses and researchers that he lived as long as he did, giving me the chance to meet him. He was one of the most wonderful people I've met, enough that I named our son after him. Thank you Harvey, for welcoming me into the family, and for being such a great guy.Let's go GDQ, and give enough to kick cancer to the curb.
I'm excited for Pokemon Sapphire later tonight. Good luck, Gunner!
Not gonna lie, really want to win that Pokemon cross-stitch. Also, blindfolded shared-controller bonus game? Come on, people, let's get it!
Great Organisation! Catch‘em all! Greets from Germany!
Thank you GDQ for 10 wonderful years of entertainment and charity work! I want to give a shoutout to everyone in the audio, tech, volunteers and anyone that has been doing their best to be good and be good at it. <3
Bourrez le pif et buvez de l'eau ! #TempeteDivine
Here’s my contribution to this amazing event. My family was recently hit with a bit of a cancer scare with my step mother. Fortunately, early detection has lowered the severity of it tremendously. Now, why not go for preventing it all together. You guys rule. Ps. I’d be down for a lecture on quantum physics from sent if you are?
Thank you so much to the Prevent Cancer Foundation, all the staff, runners, community, and everyone that makes this event so incredibly amazing.
Hi everyone! IRLGoomy here! I'm so proud of the Homestuck Twitter community for coming together and currently raising over $1.4k to get Rinoa named Vriska for charity! Special shoutout to my friend Griever who got the donation train rolling! THANKS FOR BEING AWESOME!! LETS KEEP THE DONATIONS COMING! HONK!!
[Insert very funny joke the audience WILL love]. Please clap.
This is my first time donating and my first time catching games done quick live. I wish I would be able to give more, but as a student I don't have much money. Still wanted to support, as I have lost multiple people to cancer! Keep up the work!
This comment box intentionally left blank due to a lapse in creativity by the donor.I hope to do better next time.
I just want to help out where I can. Love all of you and everything you do. Keep it up!
My Girlfriend and I had a bet last GDQ from 1v1 race, this time we doubled down and Loser has to Donate from the sonic & knuckles ... guess who's not coming to my place for awhile. much love to the speedrunning community and save frames, Kill Cancer.
The way you guys are just pummeling these Nintendohard games is just mindboggeling. Also a hello to Brickroad in the Audience.
Hey guys, long time watcher and donator here. Just making my yearly donation on my birthday. AGDQ has given me much entertainment over the years, and here's to many more.

Je regarde les GDQ depuis des années en ayant donné de temps à autres pour cette cause importante mais cette année ce don à encore plus d'importance pour moi car ma cousine à été diagnostiqué d'un cancer du pancréas... Merci à toute l'équipe du French Restream pour votre travail magnifique, Love sur vous, love sur le Chat et qu'on parviennent ensemble à venir à bout de cette merde.#DarkMage

Hey GDQ I'm really enjoying all the great runs! Keep up the good work.

I've tuned into GDQ twice a year since 2015, and I'm always looking forward to it.

Thank you all for your hard work and dedication. Let's beat cancer !
Zallard and Sinister's blindfolded race at AGDQ 2016 was one of the first runs that got me hooked on GDQ. I hope we get to see their 2p1c run!

Here’s 50 from my grandma, who I introduced to AGDQ last year. She was blown away by what an amazing event AGDQ is, and has been patiently waiting for me to update her on the next “videogame telethon”. So here’s the first donation from her during one of my favorites—Castlevania!
Killer VampireKiller kills Vampires gets ORB
Greetings esteemed guests. Joe is kicking a lot of butt on this run of Castlevania so far. Let’s see if we can get the incentive to Punch-Out met before the run ends. Keep on grooving all.

Those crochet Eevees are too cute. Let's see them not see Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!
Good luck, Joe! one of the first things I ever learned on the piano was Castlevania music, and CV IV was one of the first SNES games I ever managed to get my hands on with a real paycheck of my own. Shoutouts to Skav and...uh...is that 'Lixewup" on the couch? I can't tell, I reversed the video on my stream. Anywho, rock on, brother.
8/20 nonobstant le défi brillement relevé
I am a nurse practitioner and I see every day the damage that cancer inflicts on those afflicted and their families. It's my hope that all this raised can bring new treatments and better detection to help relieve suffering. Also I just really like video games. Yay!
Let's get Punch Out done.
Mike Tyson Train, Choo Choo. Love all the hard work the runners and GDQ staff put into this great event!
All aboard the Punch Out Train Choo Choo! Also, good luck on the SCIV run Joe!

While playing the Pokemon Sword, I was working with my friends to catch a Gigantomax Grimmsnarl, so that we all could have one. I made the statement that if it got in the next ball I threw I would give money to charity, so here I am. It is even more fitting that I am giving during pokemon prize giveaways. Let's also put this to Bonus Game 2 because Punch Out runs are amazing!!!
Had to donate for the Mike Tyson's Punch-Out! It sounds amazing and like the runners I won't be able to see it live but I will for sure watch the replay.

C'mon folks, we gotta get this Punchout run incentive met!
Remember that time we all donated to represent our favorite Pokemon and it raised a TON of money? It's a tradition now, trainers, so open those wallets! I'm donating $5.03 to represent the best Pokemon of all time, Samurott! And anybody who thinks otherwise... has to DONATE to prove it!
I want to hear the singy thingy!
We are donating because we love to watch GDQ every year as a family and love donating to a worthy cause. Props to all the dedicated runners and the event organizers! Keep up the great work! Save the HONK!!

I'm really looking forward to this Pokemon Sapphire run and to the day when we can say we beat cancer!
I had to donate after watching that Great run of Castlevania 4, which was a game that gave me and my brother such a difficult time. Early detection and surgery saved my mother who is now cancer free. You all are doing amazing work so thank you for doing this every year.
I got into speedrunning after stumbling across a video of Mike Tyson’s Punchout performed by Zallard many years ago. Seeing his runs at GDQs over the years has been awesome... but seeing a 2p1c blindfolded run WITH Sinister1?? TAKE MY MONEY!!
GDQ is awesome and I watch every year. Can't wait to see the Legend of Zelda relay tonight! Thanks to every single person involved in this event. You're just as awesome as this amazing event!
Excited for the sapphire run! Gen 3 has the best starters dont @ me.Money goes to getting that Mike Tyson's punch out run!
Hey Gunner! It's a joy to see my favorite streamer getting to show off his incredible talent. If you've never watched a Pokemon speedrun, this is the guy to keep your eyes on! This donation is for those I've lost to cancer and for the hope that those in the future will not have to experience it in any way. Good luck, Gunner! And can someone make sure Nix is banned in the chat?
If we can beat Mike Tyson's Punch Out with 2p1c, we CAN be cancer.
Gotta get that Punchout incentive!
Loving the marathon so far, keep up the great work everybody! Please put this donation toward blindfolded 2p1c Punch Out, I have *got* to see that.
Good luck in your speed run!

Hello Gamers!!! HONK!!

We all want to see this!! Let's get it!
Super pumped for the Pokémon Sapphire run! Also pumped for the crazy Punch Out run so lets meet that incentive!
Pokémon Sapphire 2/10 too much water!!!
For my job I had to make a shadowbox for a signed pair of Mike Tysons boxing shorts. They were some of the most annoying things I have framed and were cursed enough that the first frame actually broke. So this goes to the two player one controller blindfold run, I have no Idea how that is going to work, but I need to see it for the sake of catharsis.
Let's get the two good lads to fight Tyson, choo choo, donation train comin' through!
"Fufufu... I commend you. I must recognize that you are truly gifted. But! I have this in my possession! A donation to cure cancer!" Good luck on the run! Honk!

Hoenn is my favourite region and gen 3 were the first Pokémon games I ever really played properly so I gotta donate during this run of Sapphire. This is for my step dad, who's had cancer three times, and my best friend who's mum is suffering right now. Thanks to everyone for all their hard work!
Remember what you said, #NeverRunThisGame... Good luck, hope the twin battle goes well!
Always love a pokemon run. Love and Respect.
Here I was thinking that we were about to meet the donation goal for that punchout run, only to realize we're still thousands of dollars short, and that's not okay everyone! I mean come on two players on one controller, that's like twice the players, which means twice the fun right?
Been watching old GDQ Pokemon runs for the past week, so glad to finally see one live! Donation goes to runner's choice.
Pokémon runs are such a delight! After taking a gentle stroll through Galar let's enjoy blazing through Hoenn!

Much love to all, BlessRNG, and if I don't see chat popping off with BlessRNG's I'm going to be disappointed.
Hey y'all! Pokemon has always been a huge part of my life. Pokemon Yellow was the very first video game that I completed! My cousin was diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, so this donation is for him and ending this horrible disease!

Nothing could make us happier! Thank you all for everything you do!Ps : Put this donation to the Zallard1 Sinister1 blindfolded punch-out 2 players one controller race.

Just two months ago we found out my Stepmom has cancer. Donating during the speed run I've been looking forward to the most this AGDQ to help any families in the same situation.
Pokemon Gen 3 is the deffinition of my childhood. Can't wait to see this game torn apart! Also can't wait to see what may be the craziest challange at GDQ with that Punch Out run. Let's make that happen!

Honk! Pokemon sapphire is one of my favorite games of all time. Good luck for gunnermaniac to beat the game. Let's beat the cancer!
Hello! Good luck with the Pokemon run Gunner!
As a cross-stitcher myself, I needed to get into the draw for Christina's amazing tapestry! That piece must have been started back in 2010 to be ready for AGDQ 2020! The prizes right now are all amazing! I just wish I could afford to donate $133 in honour of my favourite pokemon, Eevee!
I like donations, they're comfy and easy to make!
A friend introduced me to AGDQ last year and got me interesting into speedrunning through that. Since then I´ve started to race several games by myself, starting with almost every pokemon edition I got my hands on.Loving the series, good luck to the runner and let´s beat cancer.
Sapphire was my second but my overall favorite Pokémon game and I’m excited to see it ran! Let’s see punch out!!

Greetings to all my members
Let's see some Blindfolded 2p1c punch-out action!
Donating $7 for my son's favorite and best starter Pokemon, #7, Squirtle!
Greetings from Germany. This GDQ has been a blast so far. Cancer has taken my Grandfather 7 years ago so and he has been probably the most important person in my life so I want to help as much as possible in the cancer research so noone has to lose their lost ones to those disease. Donation goes towards the Punch out incentive because everybody needs to see a 2 player 1 controller blindfolded run.
Donating 39 dollars for my favorite Pokemon, #39 in the PokeDex, Jigglypuff, the greatest Smash Character.How about we start the favorite Pokemon dex number donations from past GDQs up again chat? I apologize if your favorite Pokemon comes from Sword and Shield.
Happy to donate during the Pokemon Sapphire run! Pokemon Sapphire was the very first video game that I got engrossed in as a kid, and it's shaped me into the Pokemon loving nerd I am today. Here's hoping that the RNG is ever in your favor, Gunner!
<3
Thank you guys for all your effort!
Pensée à tous ceux et celles qui comme moi se mettent un réveil pour ne pas rater leurs runs du coeur, mais s'étalent lamentablement comme je vais le faire d'ici quelques minutes. #ConseilDes4

My favorite Pokemon is #500, Emboar! Since I don't have 500 dollars, have 500 cents instead!

I’ve been a fan of Pokémon since Gen 1 and will never forget my dad taking me to buy my first gameboy with a copy of Pokémon Blue Version. We lost him a year and a half ago to cancer, so a Pokémon speed run benefitting PCF is extra special to me this year. Good luck with the run!

My grandfather just died from pancreatic cancer in November, and now I'm kicking myself for not having donated over my past several years of watching AGDQ. I'm making this donation in his name in hopes that it can go towards having nobody die from cancer EVER AGAIN

Hey guys, had to donate while Pokémon. My dad was diagnosed with cancer last summer. Luckily it seems like he will survive without further treatment needed. He bought me my first Gameboy back in the day and of course my first game was Pokémon blue. So of course this holds a very special place in my heart. Even though my dad is not watching I wanna say I love him so much and I will do everything for him. And I love agdq, watching since 2012 and will always keep watching! Keep up the work and let's hyyyype this run up!By the way, favorite Pokémon? Charmand! Disagree? Open up your wallets people!

$18 for my main on my first play of my first Pokémon game, Sapphire, which I stole from my brother. Sure, Blaziken is cool, but why not Pidgeot?
This is SUPPOSED to be a $197 donation for my favorite Pokemon, Umbreon, but I sadly don't have that kind of money on hand right now. Still, I think this is close enough? What's #50? DIGLETT?...I guess that'll do. Good luck, Gunner! May your steps be light and your RNG manipulated! Also, how could this NOT go to the Mike Tyson's Blind 2p1c run? HYYYYYYYYYYYYYYPE!
Being home with a nasty cold, been waiting all day for Pokemon. Greetings from Denmark. Here are 15 dollars, because I can't remember the number of Gunner's favourite Pokemon, Oddish. Good luck with the run.

How has the Punch Out run not been met yet? I don't mean to take a *jab* at everyone, but frankly, I feel *cross*. A run like this will be sure to *hook* the audience. We need to *go the distance* and meet that incentive. Sorry about all the boxing puns. I guess I'm just a bit *punch drunk*.
Had to donate to this amazing event. GDQ, you're breathtaking
Howdy from the audience! I said during the Pokémon run back in AGDQ 2015 that I dream of attending a GDQ in person, one day. Five years later, I'm finally here, and I can happily say that it's been one of the best experiences of my life. Thank you for giving me something to look forward to year after year.

Pokemon has been my favourite video game series for over 20 years, and watching Pokemon Sapphire as a speedrun for an incredible cause is nothing short of incredible. Shoutout to my favourite Pokemon of this Generation, Duskull! Let's faint cancer forever!
Somebody mentioned a PokeDex donation train. Mawile doesn’t top many lists, but it’s definitely my favorite. Still saving a spot for it in my Sword play through.

I skipped French course to see this. It was worth it.
Donating during the sapphire run to show some love for one of my favorite pokemon gens, also putting this money towards the bonus game 2 incentive because i NEED to see that 2p1c blindfold punch out run
You know I had to donate during my favorite Pokemon game! What does it say about me that when I got my first adult job, my first thought was "oh boy! I can donate more to AGDQ this year!" Thank you so much to the runners, volunteers, donors, and viewers for putting on such an awesome event. Y'all are the very best, like no one ever was.
Joining the Dex donation train with my favorite Pokemon, number 778, Mimikyu! Good luck to Gunner and the rest of the runners!
Break out those trumpets - it's Hoenn time!! I'm so HYPE to see my favorite generation being played at GDQ (and heck yes mudkip)! Best of luck to Gunnermaniac! Here's to another decade of awesome games and awesome causes. <3
Hey, all! I'm excited to be watching this year's AGDQ! Donating because PCF is an amazing cause to be supporting and I've gotta try to get some of those prizes! Putting this towards Mike Tyson's Punch-Out, because let's be honest, one player beating the game blindfolded isn't enough. We need to see TWO PLAYERS beat the game blindfolded!
Have to donate for Sapphire given the amount of time I spent on RSE as a kid.I've also been told that I need to bring up Eiffel 65 when donating for any Final Fantasy incentives.
10 dollar because my favourite Pokémon is 10 Bulbasaur :)All the best for the run!
Love watching Pokemon runs while playing Pokemon. I am currently work my why through Shield again. Good luck Gunner and much love to all who make this event happen.
Pokemon Sapphire was my absolute favourite game as a kid, and was the first Pokemon game that I ever completed the Pokedex in, so I had to donate during this run. Huge thanks to all the GDQ staff for everything that they do, to the runners for all the entertainment they bring, and of course all the viewers and fans who support this amazing cause. Let's Punch=Out! cancer (while blindfolded of course!)
Great work on the quick Mudkip manip! Good luck on the rest of the run and let's keep the hype!!
Watching me and my wife's favorite game of all time, good luck to the runner!

Having seen punchout runs before, this bonus game seems more worth it than ever.
25 smackaroonies for punchout
Some time watcher, first time donator. My sister suffered from leukemia as a child and we bonded a lot over video games while she was in the hospital, especially Pokémon. Thank you all for your amazing charity work, good luck to all runners, let's all help prevent some cancer!
$26 for the best electric mouse, Raichu!
It's not a pokemon run without hearing the Jynx cry, can we get one from Shen?
Always a fan of the pokemon runs. My favorite is vaporeon, what's yours.
Greetings from Sweden!Seeing as I've been a huge fan of Pokémon ever since Gen 1, and have the worlds greatest grandfather that's currently kicking ass in his years-long ongoing fight against cancer, how could I not donate during the greatest Gen in the series, during one of the best events of every year??I do have a question for the audience though; I can't seem to remember what shape a Pokéball is?Best of luck Gunnermaniac on your run - may the RNG gods be in your favour!
My best friend is fighting against a non-operable cancer, so being with him this year is the only thing we can do. This is for him. Let's kill cancer.

Watching this Pokemon run with my two kids, who are 6 and 3. I'm hoping to make it a semi-annual tradition to watch GDQ with them as they grow up. And, I hope that cancer research continues to improve so that they never have to worry about cancer in their lifetime. I love you Addi and Jaden!
I recently learned one of my friends was diagnosed with breast cancer late last year. This donation goes out to her and to everyone else who's battling cancer. Thanks to everyone speed running this week! Lets beat cancer!
Monkey uh uh ah ah banana likeybanananana uh ah monkey monkey

Appreciate everyone who donates, keep it up guys.
Pokédex train! Donating for #365 Walrein, a Pokemon I love so much its even on my Christmas stocking!
Hey Gunner good luck on the Sapphire run and have a great time in Florida! Looking forward to hearing about your trip when you get back on Twitch!
Lucario.
Wanted to donate during a Pokemon game with my favorite Pokemon's Pokedex number, Vileplume. Shout out to my best friends listening Tyler and Bert who have helped me through losing two loved ones to cancer
Sapphire is probably my personal single most-played Pokémon game, so I'm super satisfied to see it destroyed here! Good luck - honk!!
came all this way just to see this run and I am LIVING for this! Pokemon literally was my childhood. Thank you so much to everyone involved and wishing the best to Gunnermaniac!P. S. Thank you to my hubs for pushing back our vacation so I could be here for this.
Waited to donate during Pokémon, the series that defined my childhood. Took a hiatus after gen 4 until X/Y came out and I got back into it. Good luck on the run!
I heard you like mudkips?
For that Charizard that I so cherished in my childhood. Start that 5 Dollar donation train for Punchout!
28 dollars for my favorite pokemon of all time, Sandslash! I'll donate 28 more for the alolan version during the XY run on Friday!
Hello there, long time donator, first time watcher. My first video game and console was Pokemon Ruby for the Game Boy Advance SP. It was amazing, everything about the game blew me away. I loved all the little things too - seeing my reflection in puddles, wondering what those big rocks that housed the regis were, misprounouncing Groudon and Rayquaza as "Ground-don" and "Rah-quay-za". Donating 116 for hoenn pokedex number 116, Trapinch, which is underrated. I'll end by stating that the vocal versions of the Slateport City and Trick Master songs, from the OST, deserve to be in the game. Best of luck on the run.
good luck gunner, and shoutouts to the amazing couch, bobelle, and nix!! uguu
I'm donating on behalf of my mom. She is my hero and has beaten cancer at least four times.Through it all she has remained one of the most cheerful and supportive people I know. I've always loved Pokemon and I remember watching the show every morning while Mom and I ate breakfast. Her birthday is on Thursday (the 9th), so if we could get a "Happy Birthday Denise" from the crowd or the couch, that'd be amazing! The things that PCF does for cancer awareness and early detection are so important, and I'm so happy that AGDQ supports them with this marathon every year. Thanks everyone and keep up the great work!
Mudkip for the win big bois! Favorite run and favorite game? Had to DONATE! Thanks couch and runner you're amazing.
How much for Jynx cry tho? SOMEONE has to... (Donating 22 dollars for Fearow; give this good bird some love for once!)
As an Eeveelution myself, I couldn't not donate for a chance to get those pins! $5 bonus if this is read with my name pronounced correctly!
As a pokefan i had to donate during pokemon. Take that cancer, it is super effective!

I've lost multiple grandparents and pets to cancer. So AGDQ supporting the Prevent Cancer Foundation makes it a very good cause. Let's beat cancer into the ground, and beat Mike Tyson blindfolded while we're at it!
I had to donate during Sapphire, along with Ruby and Emerald, my favorite games of all time! It's the best to see the Advanced Generation back at GDQ!Let's go Mudkip, my first and favorite, forever!

Had to donate during Pokemon! Here's $4.18 (plus an extra 10) for my favorite pokemon, Buizel! I Lost my uncle to cancer a few years ago, so if this donation can help even one person fight cancer, it'll be worth it! Good luck to all the runners this week!

I couldn't afford to donate 872 dollars, but I had to represent Snom in the "best Pokemon" competition. Been watching for years, and am always glad to pitch in to help PCF.
I have been watching for a few years and have always wanted to donate. Now that I can, what better time to donate than during my favorite pokemon generation of all time? Love this event, good luck to all the runners left to go!
Huge thank you to all runners and organizers this and every year. Long time watcher, first time donating. Couldn't hope to find a better time than my favorite pokemon gen. If possible, put this toward the Punch Out incentive.
Hey GDQ! Been looking forward to the Sapphire run all week. Donating $45.3 for Croagunk! Shout out to all the donation readers, they've been great to listen to. Cancer would be poison-type, right? That means Mud Shot is super-effective! Let's go, Marshtomp!

Hi from the third row!I've watched GamesDoneQuick from France for years and this is my first time attending. I'm so glad to be part of it for such a great cause. It's incredible to see this event has been a thing for ten years now.I'm unfortunately also affected by cancer: my uncle is going under his third chemo this month. He's one of the most incredible people I know. My dad, my aunt and my cousins are as scared as him about this whole situation but we stand as a family against the disease and I really hope cancer research discovers more efficient and less intrusive treatments for future patients.His moral isn't at the best since my Granny, his mother, passed away last September. I try to do as much as I can for him, and I would love to hear the crowd make some noise for him... Can we also get a "We love you Tonton" to cheer him up ?PS: We love you Patrick <3
Love to watch Pokemon and happy to give to an awesome cause!

Wanted to give a little something since I can relate to anyone who lives with someone sick... I had to quit everything (job, school, etc.) for almost 4 years to be by the side of my mom who was getting more sick each day... (I was 21 years old). Unfortunately, she passed away a couple months ago and I felt this AGDQ was the right moment for me to donate! Pokemom was always important in my life and my mom knew it! I Love you Mommy and this donation is for you and everyone who endures sickness or live with someone who endures it.

Had to donate during my favorite gen/game of the series. I figured this money can go to someone who needs it more than me today. I hope this makes a difference
Dont quite have $393 but heres $7 for Piplup using its Sinnoh DeX number instead. Also let's get donations going for that one controller blindfolded run!!
I'd thought I'd donate equal to my favorite Pokemon's number, Squirtle (7). Then square it. Then add in Arbok's number squared (24). Finally, we square root it all.Simple maths.
Donating on behalf of my partner, Kevin, who punched cancer right in the face. <3

So excited to be watching this run with my brother across the country! Hi Adam! Good luck with the rest of the run, Gunner! :)
The minimum donation amount is $5 and Turtwig is #387 so... What's better than one Turtwig? How about two! Thanks to everyone here at GDQ and good luck to the runners.
It is intuitively obvious, even upon casual inspection, that my preferred Pokemon is objectively superior to your preferred Pokemon. Come at me, fellow Donators! :D #blindfoldedTysonFTW
Hey all! Long time viewer, first time donating! It's always a blast when AGDQ comes around, so glad this community can come together for a good cause. Shoutouts to my sister who's watching AGDQ with me this year!

I'm always glad to donate for this awesome event but this year I have more of a reason, two years ago my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer and was eventually able to go into remission. However this thanksgiving we found out the cancer had attached to her bones and she needs to start treatment all over again. Cancer is awful no one should have to watch a loved one deal with it. I'm glad I can donate to hopefully prevent other families from dealing with it in the future.
AND THIS IS TO GO EVEN FURTHER BEYOND!!!! HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK!!!

$100 from me and $2 from my daughter who is excited to donate for Pokemon. She wants to make sure you know she does not have very much money which is why she can only give $2.

Cancer prevention and treatment has come so far since I lost my mother years ago. Molly and I are thrilled to help.

My dad was a huge gamer all his life and he got me my first video game, Pokemon Ruby, when I was only five years old. Unfortunately he lost his battle with cancer a few months ago, but I know he would love what AGDQ is doing and I hope we can all work together to kick cancer's butt!
Always gotta donate during Pokemon runs! Shout out to pokemon 27 Sandshrew and to my boyfriend for turning 27 on the 27th of next month!

Doc Louis said to take the money I would use to join the nintendo fun club and put it towards the punchout run.
Long time viewer, first time donator. I love watching GDQ whenever it comes around, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. I just moved into a new place and it’s nice to relax to some speedruns while sorting everything out. Chugga-chugga-Pika-CHOO-CHOOOO!
For the $5 hype train! And also for the best pokemon game with the amazing trumpet soundtrack.
Lugia is my favorite, but I got to get in on all the rewards, so why not add ten cents.

Love what y'all do <3

Donating for a chance at that amazing Pokemon cross stitch! Thank you to everyone that donates time and prizes to make this event so special!

Hello GDQ and hello SushiCord
Every year I want to spend more money then i should but its going to a good cause so that makes me want to spend more.
The first GDQ I watched was a zallard1 blindfolded run. I was blown away! Thanks to him I have been addicted to this awesome community. Psyched for this two man blindfolded run!
The past GDQ runs of Zallard1 and Sinister1 are how I first heard of AGDQ. I'm so psyched to see this happen. Time to take the World Circuit titles yet again. Go get it, guys.
This is for My 6 year old Nephew who doesn't understand live content and wants to play the games the speedrunners are playing so he can play with them
My lovely sister is in the audience today ! 11,000 kilometers away yet I am very glad that such a great event dedicated to gaming and preventing cancer is the thing that unites us today !Good luck to everyone and love from Azerbaijan !

Hey everyone. I'm donating for the sake of my beloved mother, who's been struggling and fighting against cancer for over twenty years now. I'm always hoping for that day when she can finally be free from that pain. Thanks for all your hard work, and keep on doing great things for the work!
I love the idea of donating for your favorite Pokemon! Here's $38 for Ninetales! 🦊

Huge shout-out to everyone working hard on and off camera and to everyone donating. This event is always a great way to start off the year and shows what we can accomplish when we work together!
This stream got me into speedrunning countless years ago, and with my grandfather dying of cancer, and some of my best friends having cancer scares, this charity means so much to me. Thank you for all you do, and of course, don't stop going fast. PS: I'm envious of you all that get to watch it at work. Must be so nice!
For the pokemon whose original tv episode made me cry, Butterfree!
Omega weapon is like cancer, let's crush it!
I've been very lucky to make it decently far in life without cancer affecting any of my loved ones. Donating to help keep it that way!
Stay motivated! Go Badger!
I box at college and would sooner go against Mike Tyson in the ring than blindfolded and one-handed in Punch-Out. Good luck to the runners!
Excited for the upcoming Terraria run, wonder what crazy shenanigans is going to happen during it.
I just left my grandmother's funeral. Thank you, AGDQ, for giving me something to smile about with Zelda runs and good commentary. All week, you've given me a source of levity amidst all of the sorrow. I'm donating $74 - one for each year of my grandma's life. Here's to more years for more grandmas.
Super excited for this Punch out, Terraria and Zelda block, how are there so many amazing runs happening already? It's only Tuesday! GDQ you're the best!

Gotta donate during Punch-Out!! One of my proudest moments as a kid was beating Sandman (who is waaaaaay harder than Tyson).Let's go Sinister and Zallard. Make it look stupidly easy!
Glad to see the legends, sinister1 and zallard1 doing the impossible, Take down Tyson. Get the new WR for a new category.
Finally able to catch this live. Loved seeing the runs on YouTube!
Let's go Punch-Out! I'm in awe of runners who can do any game blindfolded, so donating for the FF8 blindfolded menuing for more of this master sorcery.
Donating for Bryce Walton's birthday!
Tyson doesn't stand a chance. Stick and move, stick and move!
Sinister and Zallard are the greatest duo in Punchout history! Sorry Little Mac and Doc Louis...
What a crazy run! Runners your style is impetuous! Go get Mike!
Best charity gaming event there is! Go Zallard and Sinister!
AGDQ is my new favorite event and it runs for the entire week of my birthday!!
Watching the Kings of Punch out doing the impossible
Amizing blindfolded madness!
Hawk swooping in, long time watcher and frequent donator. Im always looking forward to the GDQ events and this year I even took a week off from work to watch as many runs as I can. Lets give cancer an uppercut, people!
The kindred Contra spirits say - knock him out! Good luck Zallard and Sinster!
Here's ten dollars for each of the first three fights. I'll be donating another ten dollars for every fight won without a knockdown.
Loving the blindfolded Punch-Out! Keep it up!
We have witnessed history today with Zallard and Sinister! Shout-outs to everyone in Orlando!
HEY GDQ, WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE FLOWER?MINE'S CHOCOLATE!!!GO GET 'EM MAC
My significant other and I have watched GDQ for a few years now, and while I haven't been able to donate in the past, as a former brain cancer patient myself, I couldn't NOT donate this year, no matter how small the amount may be. Happy I'm able to help a wonderful foundation, and even happier to do this while watching some amazing runs.
Uncle, Maternal Grandmother, and Mother-in-Law all affected by the Big C. Let's PUNCH OUT cancer, AGDQ 2020!
Long time watcher, first time donator. Loving the runs. Much appreciation to all the runners, commentators, staff and volunteers.
This donation is from my son and I. We are greatly enjoying the Punch Out! run - he's incredibly impressed. As an actual Pediatrician I can truly say that I appreciate everything that the runners are doing to support Prevent Cancer!

This is the first GDQ where I've been able to donate, and what a time to do it! My Mom is officially cancer free, and what better way to celebrate that than during this incredible run of Punch Out. Thank you to everyone who makes this possible, let's Punch Out cancer!
Punch it allll!
This mike Tyson run is insane. Let’s punch out cancer!
love punch out, love gdq, loving this INSANE RUN. good luck against tyson, not that you’ll need it! ding ding ding!
Grand bravo a vous, premier don que je fais sur un stream caritatif, le tout en pleine nuit vers 3h du mat ! J'espère pouvoir aider même si je donne très peu car je suis étudiant ! ^^ Courage a vous tous ! Je vous donne toute mon énergie ! #YomiCeleste
I never knew how exciting speedruns of the Punch Out games could be until I watched Zallard’s blindfolded run at a previous GDQ. Now, it’s a highlight of the marathon and I wouldn’t miss it. Let’s Punch Out cancer! Best of luck to the runners!
It isn't a GDQ without Zallard punching dudes while blindfolded. And bonus, there's Sinister as well! Go get 'em, guys! By the way, put this toward singing "Eyes on Me," because who doesn't enjoy live performances?!
Let's punch-out cancer! Good luck to all the speedrunners and thank you all for this amazing event.
It's a good cause and I love gdq.
This Punchout run is amazing! Here's to knocking out cancer.
This is simply amazing
Please read the following aloud on stream! It would mean a lot to my wife :-)After watching AGDQ for years, what better time to donate than on the 10 year anniversary. And what better way to honor our dog Loki who we unfortunately lost to cancer. Here's to our amazing dog who we lost way too soon, and here's to many more years of speedrunning and charity!
I always love watching these events and I can't stop being amazed by the two runners owning this game while blindfolded! Let's continue giving the 1-2 to cancer and eventually deliver it the TKO punch! Keep up the amazing job, runners!
Loving the event so far!! special shoutouts to the dancing guys at the front row, loved 'em!!. Cheers from Brazil!
H-h-hey... Berri.... I wont be making it home for awhile, the fellas are shipping off tomorrow. Something about "Saving the animals", I dont know. Hope you understand. Wonder if AGDQ voted me their favorite this year.... Who doesnt love a squirrel in a hoodie?

Let's go Sinister and Zallard!
Hi, Melinda!!!
When I saw Zallard's blindfolded Punch Out Wii at a previous GDQ I was impressed. This is ridiculous!
I owe these runners more than this for all the events I've enjoyed over the years, but this is a start. Let's hear the best video game theme song ever EVER live and in person.
This two player, one-controller blindfolded Punch-Out run is absolutely MENTAL. Had to donate again for this. Go Sinister and Zallard!!
All I have to say about this run is, "Are you freaking kidding me?!?!"
Punchout run is insane so far. Lets knock out cancer and keep this event going for another 10 years! Miss you grammy!
Love AGDQ!
Had to donate during this awesome run. We lost my dad a couple years back at the age of 66 to a rare cancer. Punch out was his favorite game in the world, so I could not miss this! Thank you for all that you do for this great cause. Shout out to my gaming brothers in the front row! They know who they are.!
My now cancer free grandma give me $10 for the awesome cause, and i will spend it now because I just can´tbelive that there are 2 guys playing blindfolded with one controller
Love the event, love the charity. Good luck on on your runs, runners!
These Blindfold Punch Out runs are so epic! Gotta show love to my guys Zallard and Sinister! Like Rocky and Apollo the rivals join together to beat a stronger foe! GL you two! Show em the DUFF!
I used to just love watching GDQ but now every time it rolls around I can’t wait to donate as well!
It's become a tradition for me to donate during Punch-Out, one of my favorite Nintendo series of all time. So....TRADITION! Have a great run guys!
6 year old Zelda says "Good job! Hope you win!"
Blindfolded Punch-Out run is spectacular!! Such amazing runners! Let's also get to that Final Fantasy VII Blindfolded menuing!
Here's 20 smackeroos!
Here to conquer cancer, beat Mike Tyson Blind-folded, and say hi to our boy DTysonator!
Totally geeking out on this Punch-Out!! run! Sinister and Zallard making this look easy! Great playing guys, this is fantastic!
This run is a Knock Out so far. Keep it up.
Got to love GDQ
Hot diggity. I'm not usually a Mike Tyson person, but this is amazing.
Two-man blind-folded Punch Out is the definition of entertainment! Amazing job guys!! Can't help but donate after watching this!
Wish we had the skill shown in this years GDQ. Awesome job to all the runners and to everyone in support of preventing cancer! Donation goes to them sweet sweet dulcet tones of Sumi's to sing Snake Eater!!!
Amazing performance for an incredible! What will Sinister and Zallard do next, play with their toes? Play wearing boxing gloves?
Great games for a great cause! This AGDQ has been amazing so far!
First time donation. Keep up the awesome work by everyone involved.

Wanted to give a shout out to my big brother, Eric. If it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be a gamer and therefore wouldn’t have gotten to experience AGDQ. Thank you all!
Incredible run Sinister and Zallard! I missed the earlier NES block so wanted to shoutout to the epic Ninja Gaiden 2 race and Castlevania 4 runners! Congrats everyone!
 (Comment rejected)
Had to throw in one for that INSANE Punch-Out run! Sinister and Zallard have BLOWN MY MIND to smithereens! ...Blindfolded Punch Out Wii with motion controls when?
I just had to donate after that amazing TASbot run of Mike Tyson's Punch Out! Great work, team! Please put this toward Super Monkey Ball!
GDQ is so monumentally entertaining! It's something I look forward to, and it always feels like a holiday when it comes around. :D
This blindfolded two player Punch-out run is amazing.
This PunchOut run is amazing. Can’t wait for the FFVIII run later tonight. This donation goes to defeating the always tough Omega.
Hit 'im. Hit 'im!
Did that really just happen? Sinister and Zallard are maniacs.
I wasn't going to donate this much just yet, but that Punchout run was amazing and we have to hear Eyes on Me the way it was meant to be sung: by dozens of sleep deprived, over caffeinated super-fans!
That was amazing
I know I said $10 for every fight won without getting knocked down, but that was so impressive I'm doubling it.
Ultima weapon, is the ultimate incentive to donate to help defeat cancer. Good luck to the runners!
Greetings, Altermaven here! As a Terraria player, it's good to see that Badger is here to take it down quick. Hopefully nothing goes too horribly wrong. Let's get Omega Weapon in Final Fantasy VIII unlocked. Excited to see the runs for the rest of the week!
I do not believe what I just saw! Here's some worth dollar for the cause, that was unreal. The money goes to the runner choice
Gonna try to send this at the right time, this time. Awesome punch out fight, insane! Question for the Terraria runner, have you ever done a craftless run?
Absolutely incredible run, take my money.
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE OMG
That Punchout blindfold run was absolutely ridiculous. Great job!
Truly phenomenal co-op blindfolded Punch Out run, that scarcely could have gone any better.
Blindfolded, shared controller, beaten without being knocked out a single time?! Are you heckin' kidding me?!Putting this toward some more blindfolded action in FF8!
AMAZING punch out run. SO excited for the terraria run, one of my favorite games of all time!!!!!
#ConseilDes4 vive le gaming

That was AMAZING!
What an incredible Punch Out run! That level of skill and cooperation was intense! Love all the work GDQ does.
That Punch-Out!! 2p1c blindfolded run was amazing! Here's ten bucks to see some more blindfolds during the Final Fantasy 8 run. Luzbelheim's blindfolded menuing is worth seeing!
What an absolutely INCREDIBLE run of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out!! These runners never fail to amaze! Put this towards bringing the blindfolds back out for the Menu Boss!
O-M-G!!! That blind Punch out fight!!
THAT MIKE TYSON FIGHT WAS BEYOND HYPE!!! WELL DONE SINISTER1 and ZALLARD!!!!! BEST RUN OF THE MARATHON!!!!
This is for that amazing blindfolded PunchOut run!
I love watching the mike tyson punch out runs every year. Great job knocking it out yet again!

That was... incredible!
Zallard. Sinister. How? Just...how?
What an incredible run! Those Punchout skills knocked me out. ;) I can't not donate after witnessing something so impressive. Good luck to the next runner and I can't wait to keep being in awe of all the talented speedruns.
Donating another $20, because “Why do we even play video games” hahaha
Hey Badger, nice to see you on GDQ. Here 100 for you to choose where it goes. no pushups needed for these. As all AGDQ this is the annual donation for my Uncle we we lost years ago on Christmas to Melanoma. Here is hopeing that we can make sure no one else has to suffer for this lost.
Are you sure Tyson wasn't the one blindfolded here? He got STOMPED!
Enjoying this awesome Terraria speed run with my son. Thank you to all of the runners and staff for all of your hard work and dedication!!Lets here your best HONK !!!!
Kudos to the staff, crew, volunteers, runners, and this hype crowd for putting on this great event every year. Keep up the great work!
That punchout run was insane!!!!! I couldn't dream of playing like that with both eyes and hands let alone co-op and blindfolded.
 (Comment rejected)
You are all amazing. Heres to gaming and Amiibos!
I can't not donate after that. Good grief! What's next!? Blindfolded punch out controlled with the NES Power Pad?!
 (Comment rejected)
What an amazing blindfolded run, take my money!
Mighty impressive run. What's next, blindfolded playing two games at once with two players each having half of the controller for each game?
Zallard and Sinister always put on a good show 2p1c blindfolded is such a crazy run. Can't wait to see the zelda relay races, going to be pretty hype as well!
I've played a ton of Terraria and I can't wait to see this game destroyed
Having spent over 200 hours on Terraria, I thought I was pretty good. But 4,500 hours, gazooks! Fantastic runner and fantastic game. Let's kick cancer's butt!
 (Comment rejected)
Congrats on an amazing run! Hands down incredible.
WAY TO GO ZALLARD AND SINISTER! STILL THE BEST!
What an amazing 2P1C blindfolded Punch-Out run by Zallard and Sinister! It's always amazing to see you two skyrocket the bar every GDQ. Keep up the great work!
Woooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow see ya Tyson!
So glad I tuned in in time to witness that amazing blindfolded Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!! run. Love watching AGDQ for moments like these.
Excitate vos e somno! (Awake, sleeping ones!) I'm super excited to see "Final Fantasy VIII" at AGDQ. It was my first "Final Fantasy" game and is still one of my two favorite games in the series. I'm donating a dollar for every "Triple Triad" card, even though we probably won't even see the card game in this run. Put my donation toward the Omega Weapon fight!
Truly amazing seeing tyson knocked out blindfolded without being downed once! take my money and knock out cancer!
THAT PUNCH OUT WAS INSANE!
Gotta get in my donation for them Zelda Orbs. I just lost the game.
What a great game a wave of nostalgia getting ruined by sandman. donation incentive goes to dancing white hats choice.
Zelda Hype!!!
Sinister & Zallard just blew my mind w/ that Punch-Out run, probably the best thing I've ever seen at a GDQ event.
Been enjoying AGDQ So much this year. Looking forward to the Zelda run ahead. Amazing show. Thanks to all the behind the scenes crew who keep this event running.
That punch-out 2 person blindfold run was insane! Also, gotta get in the draw for some of those sweet prizes.
nice to see and hear Breakdown!
Since all the bonus games have been met, I'm donating not only to help stop cancer but also for the additional content of these incentives like 'Fighting Omega Weapon' because lets face it Omega is the real boss of FF8.
Had to go ahead and make my first donation of the event. The Prevent Cancer Foundation does such important work, and as someone who works at a university and sees the important research happening to try to detect cancer earlier and beat it once and for all, I know how important research funding is to these efforts. Thanks to everyone at AGDQ for your efforts to make this event happen, and to the Prevent Cancer Foundation for everything you do!
PRIZES!!!1
Amazing work on that blind tag team Punch Out! Thanks all for showcasing their amazing skills with these awesome games!
Oo those enamel pins are dope!

Thank you for all of the positivity generatd by everyone that has participated in this year's event!
Sitting here with my wife and our two toddlers watching some amazing runs! Hopefully they grow up loving this aweosme community and wholesome event as much as we do. Heres to 10 years! HYPE!
Cheers to GDQ for everything you all do. It's awesome to see all the crazy things that happen in these events. I love all of it.
I didn't think anything was going to top the blindfolded run of Punch-Out Wii from last year, but I was wrong! That was an amazing two-person one-controller run! Thanks for a wonderful AGDQ this year, here's to many more in the future (and some money for the OOT glitch exhibition later this week!)
mon corps est prêt #LonaLink
I have to donate toward anything to keep FFVIII on the screen longer!
Absolutely love Terraria and looking forward to this run
Oh please let me bring that Zant home <3

Amazing blindfolded run by Sinister and Zallard! Here's 15 dollars for some more blindfolded action.
That Punch-Out!! run was phenomenal. Props to the runners!
Thanks for the many years of great entertainment and for helping a great cause!
That Punch-Out run was incredible. It's been an awesome few days of runs so far and I'm looking forward to the rest of the week. Thanks to everyone for making this event possible. Good luck to all the runners.
WE ARE NOT WORTHY. That 2 player blindfolded punch out run was INSANE.Also, I see there is a Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition incentive not hit yet. That HAS to happen!
I had a lot of fun playing Terraria with my brother when the game first came out, but I've never seen a speedrun of it before. I'm excited to see what happens!

Amazing Run and would love to win the Eevee Perler for my girlfriend. I love all the work you all do and incentive goes to Contra Hard Corps Bonus Ending.
Words can't express how awesome that Punch-Out run was. It certainly made me believe that miracles can in fact happen. I'm putting half of this toward making sure "it's a joke" in Super Hydlide and the other half toward seeing Mega Man 3 DOS in the graphics mode it truly deserves to be seen in.
Terraria HYYYPE!!
Mike Tyson’s Punch out was the craziest thing I’ve ever seen. Now let’s Punch Out Cancer!
That Punch-Out run was amazing! But I can't wait for Saturday. Where we get to see the greatest game released in 2019 staring:The Agent of Anarchy, The Commander of Chaos, The Villain of the Village, the one the only HONKY BOI.Untitled Goose Game is my 2019 game of the year.Lets blow past $500,000 and hit $750,000 TONIGHT LETS DO THIS!
In memory of my best friend, Kerry Coen
Just woke up, what did I miss?
Still trying to pick up my jaw from the floor after that Mike Tyson 2 player one controller blindfold run. Simply amazing. Keep up the great work folks. Kick cancers butt. Honk!

Hey AGDQ, I was floored when I heard that Badger made it in this year. Terraria is one of my all time favorite games. Badger has inspired me with how open and involved he is in his and the Terraria communities and the many things that he has talked about during his streams. Donating during a personal favorite streamer AND game could not be a better time. I do this in remembrance of my grandfather who passed away just over 3 years ago to mesothelioma. Let's continue to defeat not only Moonlord, but cancer all together. GO BADGER!
I saw my lord running this game so you know I had to donate good luck on the run lord badger
S/O to Raz the Orc in the audience
First time donating! I just got my first job and I'm excited to see everything coming from GDQ!!! Have a great time to everyone there!!

That Punch-Out run was amazing!
First time watching live and had to donate. Since I got here just in time for Terraria, here is one cent for every hour steam says I've spent playing it. Incentive to runner's choice.
Hey Badger, your old friend here KillKill. I've been waiting very impatiently the whole event for you to come on stage. The entire D&D crew is rooting you on! And let's beat cancer!
ZELDA HYPE!!!!!
Holy cow. That double-blind PunchOut run was something else!
Keep it up AGQ!
Love Terraria, and love what you guys are doing. Thanks for an amazing week of runs!!
Keep up the great work!
OMG THAT HYLIAN SHIELD THO
Let's go badger! We love you! Let's beat the moon lord like we will beat the cancer from the world!
Super excited to see Terraria being run at a GDQ, I've put in over a thousand hours on it according to Steam so you could say I'm a bit of a fan.Shoutouts to Speedfriends, stay comfy
Badger! Have a great run. The Badger Clan loves and supports you. Good luck and enjoy! Love, Nekkra
Being home sick isn't as bad knowing there is all these exciting runs to watch. Good luck to the runner and let's make cancer a thing of the past!
I'm nominating Squall's name to be Rinoa because it would confuse people and confusion is hilarious.
In honor of my love, cancer survivor and Zelda fan. Also...thank you all for the amazing content!
Let's GO!
Been working on a terraria run for days now... time to be shamed. HONK!
First time seeing a Terraria Speedrun and I'm excited to see this boss get stomped faster than I ever could
Badger clan bringing the LOVE
Absolutely loving ADGQ this year. Congrats to all the runners doing an amazing job for an excellent cause.
Gotta donate during my favorite game! Good luck with the run
Watch GDQ every year and LOVE the Zelda block! The blind punch run was ridiculous! Doing this in memory of my aunt who died of breast cancer.
That blindfolded 2p1c Punch-Out!! run was absolutely insane, flawlessly executed. That will be almost impossible to top.
So grateful to be watching GDQ with my brother - thanks to the amazing group of humans involved in pulling this off! GDQ Love!
I love the work you guys are doing. Keep it up! amazing streams for an amazing cause.

Thought I was done donating but Punch Out was bigger than a silly budget. Let's go Terraria.
Trepies represent, let's get a train going so the best girl Quistis can put the Laser Eyes to cancer and Omega Weapon!
Fantastic to see Terraria at GDQ! You will be brilliant, as always, Badger. I'm praying to the RNG gods for quick voodoo doll and Plantera bulb. Good luck and have fun! Love, from the Badger Clan <3

Long time GDQ watcher, but first time catching the stream. I've been watching it all week at work, so I've obviously been very productive. Put my donation towards singing SNAKE EATER!!!
Here's to that amazing Punch-Out run and to get me into that juicy Grand Prize drawing. But for real, everything you all are doing is awesome so can I get a HONK for all the people running, those behind the scenes, and everyone from the Prevent Cancer Foundation?
Seeing this game on AGDQ is urging my warts to fight cancer!
Hey badger. Rageplays here. Still working on the everything% run. I'll donate $5 more if you do a pushup during the run.
Hope everyone is having an AMAZING time with this AGDQ marathon, I know I always do. Good luck to all the runners and keep up the good work to all the staff.
Here's to all the Runners at GDQ & to a Good Cause! Also multiple runs of the Zelda Series? That's Crazy!
So cool to see a Terraria run - this game is so much fun and seeing a speedrun of it is incredibly cool. Good luck with the run tvgBadger!
Thanks to everyone for making Games Done Quick possible!
Yay for the first Terraria run at GDQ!
Can't wait for the LOZ Series run!
Terraria is one of the few games I've gotten my girlfriend into and I'm so happy to see such a fun game that has helped bridge that gap at GDQ! Wishing you a great run Badger!
I don't get to watch most of GDQ this time live, but from what I've seen, these runs look... Awesome. Can't wait to catch the VoDs.

Badger, GOOD LUCK and Great RNG! Here is to an awesome game, and an awesome Streamer!
Y'all were getting my money no matter what cause heck cancer to heck, but that framed Zelda Pearler set is to DIE for...or at least donate for? Maybe?
Lets go @Badger ! Good luck !
Good job, Badger! So glad to see you on here! You got this!
Hey Badger! Loving this run of terraria! You are doing great! TVGBdummy! Also where is hat?
Gotta donate during Terraria! Easily one of my favorite games of all time, with almost 2000 hours in it on Steam alone! Seeing you dupe bars en masse is quite jarring.
that punchout run was great, terraria run looks really fun donating $7.22 for my favorite bean rowlet because i missed that donation train earlier.
Let’s beat cancer!
Keep up the Amazing work Badger! Much love from the whole Cuddle Crew!
Long time viewer, love the event, love Terraria, love everyone!

I've been playing Terraria since I was a small child. it's one of my favorite games and I can't wait to see it torn apart. Good luck TVGBADGER!!!!
MEATWALL!
Hey guys! Hey Badger! Good luck with the run.
Little known fact, but Bike is short for Bichael.
Loved Badgers energy so much that I felt compelled to donate. This one is on you!
Keep doing good!
Lets Go Badger!
Hey AGDQ, the year I first donated to this awesome event was the year I lost my aunt to cancer. I haven't stopped donating since, because even though it was too late for her, many more can still be helped. I wish to honor her memory in this way, while adding to this awesome event! Have a Honking Good time!

Thanks for helping to combat cancer--Keep it up, and break those donation goals!
Enjoying the energy from Badger in this run. Keep up the good work!
Hey Badger, who needs a couch when you have a whole crowd?You're awesome dude!
Greeting from germany at 3 am! Had to get up for Terraria - one of my all time favorite so I needed to donate. I wish best luck for all the runners and keep doing what you started 10 years ago. Donation goes to runners choice.
Had to donate after that insane Punch Out Run. What's next? Blindfolded, 2 players, with feet?
Thanks to the organizers and runners for championing a great cause. Good luck in all those sweet, sweet speed runs!
badger with the best commentary and 9000 IQ gameplay. HYPE!!
Someone close to me recently got diagnosed with cancer. Fortunately, it is at a highly treatable stage. Early detection, research and education definitely contributed to an optimistic treatment schedule and I am so happy organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation are around to fund these efforts! (PS: donors, make sure you find out if your company does employee giving match)
No need to read, I just like prizes :)

So excited to see a run of Terraria @ AGDQ done by my favorite streamer! You have one of the best streamer communities and getting to see such an extraordinary game being run by an expert makes this an even more awesome experience. Keep up all the great work and GL on Moonlord!
Donating to give a shout out to my friend Jackson, who loves Terraria, but is not able to watch this live as he spending his evening feeding the homeless. The spirit of GDQ is to give back, and we all are doing our part!
I wasn't sure when/if I would donate, but after seeing TVGBadger bring so much positive energy into his run I just knew this was the right time. Thanks for the energy and joy you're bringing, Badger, and best of luck!
Just as in Terraria we struggle to remove the Corruption, Crimson and Hallowed from the world, we too fight to strike cancer from our world. Keep up the good fight both PCF and Badger!
I'm loving both the Punch-Out! run and this Terraria run!
Gmod Speedrun (Big Thonk)
Awesome Terraria run by a great runner! Doing a great job giving a great explanation. Shout out to my wife Jessica who I just married two weeks ago! Love you Jessica!
Terraria is the first game I did speedrun races of, many versions ago. I don't recognize what's happening now but it's amazing.Putting this donation toward Cadence of Hyrule double time mode!
Let's go for some sing along with Final Fantasy.
Really enjoying the Terraria run. Big Thank You to TVGBadger for the upbeat commentary. Hope the luck stays on your side!
Never heard of Terraria, but I'm really digging this run and the runner's attitude and enthusiasm and especially his INSANE multitasking skills. Best of luck for the rest of the run and thanks to the whole GDQ team for putting on such an awesome event for a good cause! HONK!
Hi
Never seen nor heard of Terraria before, but I'm diggin' the game and diggin' the runner. Keep it up, Badger!
I'm so glad I managed to make it in time to see your run, I'm do proud to see you make it here, this is so great! Let's all help prevent cancer, together!
Have to donate for my favorite game! I have spent many hours playing terraria myself and its insane to see it get destroyed by Badger! Goodluck! Honk!
I’m loving Terraria’s GDQ debut! You’ve inspired me to finally finish hard mode. Good luck on the rest of the run!
I SEE EEVEE, I DONATE (I need that peeler)
Honk!
This run made me reinstall terraria. badger is a great on screen personality. incentive to runners choiceFor my Nana <3
My system's always loved Terraria and it's great to see it run here, even with the game being item-duplicated in half. Bring on Master mode!I'm starting the donations for Animorphs here. Another try of that would be interesting- um, I mean, they totally finished it the first time, right?Quack
Another GDQ, another incredible experience and another way to give!
Thanks for all the incredible work!
Finally my favorite time of the year when people beats more games in 1 week than I did in my entire life!
TY for this run on terraria ! GLHF !
Sending in my donation during the run of one of my favorite games. I've got almost 1000 hours dropped in to Terraria and I'm overjoyed to see it at GDQ. Good luck on the Moon Lord and watch out for Plantera spikes!
Lucky-Quack!
This is the weirdest dig dug mod I have ever seen. Shout out to the retro room crew from ODU. Beat cancer so GDQ has to find a new boss!
Good luck on the run!“Impending doom approaches...” For The Moonlord and Cancer!
Watching Epic Terraria run with my son and loved the wall of flesh take down. Let's go!!!

Badger is so entertaining! Donating for his enthusiasm!
I first found Terraria thanks to TotalBiscuit's videos back in the day. Wherever you are, TB, this goes out to you.
Much love badger, thanks for being awesome!
First time ever watching TVGBadger and I'm super impressed by your energy and positivity! Great job so far! Keep it up!
Never seen a Terraria speedrun before, so it's safe to say that I've really been missing out. All the best on the run. HONK!!!
Learned about this broadcast from cl0wnt0wn on Twitch. Please accept this donation on his behalf.
Looking forward to the Legend of Zelda Relay. Honk Hype!

Hello from the tech team! KILLER RUN! Glad to see the game in GDQ! I guess I am BlackBadger I am already apart of the Badger Clan without even meeting you! BADGERS UNITE!
Happened to get home in time for Punch-Out, and what a show it was! The runs continue to raise the bar, and the charity continues to make the world a better place, keep being generous everyone. (Greets to QuakeNet IRC, yes we are still here!)
Let's defeat cancer like we're gonna defeat moon lord! Go go Badger!
My whole family has been looking forward to the Terraria speed run today. Here's $5 from each of us. Good luck, Badger!
Honk!
Wanted to donate during the Sonic block the other day, but I was at work, so I will ask this now: Why do you think they call it Naruto Running when Sonic did it first? Great runs so far btw :)
First time for Terraria, first time for badger, first time donation! Best of luck to Badger, duck machine hype!
Glad to donate to a great cause, sadly will miss the zelda run but oh well take my money and lets beat Cancer!

Badger, Good luck on the run. So excited to see such a great speedrunner doing an amazing game. Also, Badger do the star dance.

Terraria is one of my favorite games! Beat up Plantera so I can get revenge on all the times I died to him!

This Terraria speed run has my palms sweating!! So happy to see this at a Games Done Quick. Badger you're killing it my dude! *QUACK?*
This is fun to watch :) Greetings from Germany
Cancer researcher here! Grateful to PCF and organizations that fund this critical research! Just a quick reminder to everyone (including myself!) that physical activity is one of the best tools we have to prevent cancer. Any movement counts! Front row dancing, stretching, and walking around are all subtle ways to punch cancer in the face! Everyone take a quick stretch!
Badger, badger, badger, badger, tvbadger. Really loving the run.
It's been some time since I played Terraria, but this run is bringing back the memories. Keep doing awesome.Greetings from back couch!
This Terraria run is brutal! You can do it Badger! Donating to hear Eyes on me! Love that song and all the final fantasy runs at gdq! Keep up the great work everyone!
SENDING YOU MY ENERGY TO GET THROUGH THIS! YOU GOT THIS!!
Please, please, PLEASE keep going Badger! This game is fantastic and I want to see all of the ridiculouslness in store with it!

For that literally unbelievable punch-out run! I mean they were obviously finger syncing to a premade video. Right? No way they actually just did that!
Hello Orlando! Long time AGDQ fans here, we're so happy to see our all time favorite game (Terraria) for the first time at a GDQ marathon. Thank you for always having such a diverse selection of games.
Choo choo BADGER GO
I saw that sweet spirit orb and had to donate for my shot at that. Are we still saying "orb?"OOOOOOOOOORB!!!
BUX FOR BONKS! I will count every bonk I see and donate $10 per bonk to the cause. SAVE THE FRAMES, KILL THE CANCER. There is no honk, there is only BOOOOOONK -- #zeldarelay

15 minute wait? Let's show Badger our support with a $15 dollar train!!!
Hey there ! Good luck for the run ! My girlfriend is watching the stream cause she love the game. Can you say: "Love you SuperStephh" Live ? i'll double the donation if you do it !
BUILD A HOUSE BUILD A HOUSE BUILD A HOUSEJokes aside, this is a really cool run for one of my favorite games, Badger is rocking it!
Never seen a terraria speedrun before, badger you’re doing awesome and thank you for your sacrifice
This Terraria run has been great, despite the small setbacks. Badger's brought great energy to the stream!
Love the energy this runner is bringing to one of my favorite games!
15 minutes? Sounds like a good excuse to donate $15! Still loving the run, can't wait to see the final boss!
As someone who spend the past 6 years fighting cancer, I am very grateful for everyone's efforts to make sure others don't go through the same thing. Had to donate during one of my favorite games, Terraria always needs more love. Stay awesome!
I've never donated before and I've also never watched Badger before but this Terraria run is one of the most enjoyable runs I've ever seen, and I've been watching AGDQ since the beginning. Great work, Badger. Followed.
15 dollar train for a 15 minute wait? you're doing great badger, I love this run!
Badger, this is amazing, you are amazing, can you demonstrate a HOIK? My favorite part of Terraria
Best of luck Badger! Great to see a run of one of my favorite games once i chimed into AGDQ!
What about the Enchanted Sundial from a wooden crate, Badger?! Good luck with the run!
Build a House!!!!
Excited for all the fun games this year, let's kick cancer's butt!
Donating to help fill in the delay time for Badger. Please read this slowly. I've never played Terraria before and I totally don't understand it at all, but I'm enjoying the stream.Anyway, It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way – in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.That's all I could find on Google. Good luck, Badger!
i lost my Grandmother back in 2011 during my second deployment from cervical cancer, never got to officially say goodbye, so lets keep the donations going to kill off cancer and not have more people in these situations.
Suggestion for TVGBADGER : build a house or cool structure while waiting for nightfall!
Build a house dude!
Don't give up!!! There are items that change the day/night cycle! Enchanted sundial
Don't worry, you're still on track to beat this game faster than it took me to figure out how to build a wall!
build a house!
Support train for Badger and PCF!
Hey TVGBadger, In the meantime, how about some building? I'll donate another $25 if you build your best wooden goose.HONK
Badger - you are an incredible member of the Terraria community. We are so thankful to have such a kind, entertaining, and talented member of the Terraria Community Team. Keep up the legendary work!
Yo listen, big Terraria fan, always been for a long time and seeing it at GDQ is the most exciting thing ever and Badger has without a doubt been one of my favorite runners in GDQ so far. Absolutely loving the run so far, good luck!
BUILD THAT HOUSE
The gameplay you see when you turn on GDQ never fails to blow my mind, this Terraria run is off the hook! Shoutout to the 502 Krew!
Hey badger, before this run I had no idea who you were or that it was even possible to speedrun terraria but I’m loving this so consider me a new fan! Can’t wait to catch your streams and good luck on the rest of the run! Donation goes to runners choice :)
Enfin insomniaque mais pas trop non plus, quand vous lirez ces messages je serai couché, bonne soirée/journée et hydratez-vous #LonaLink

Bet you won't get rainbow blocks before the moon lord. Do it and I double the donation.
I have never donated to a stream before. But what you all do,-the broadcasters, runners, even the crowd that keeps the hype going- has moved me so much I just had to give something. Thank you all so much.J.R. Young
I've never watched Terraria before but your passion and knowledge of this game made me have to donate. Keep it up!
I was saving this for another run but Badger is amazing and super positive. Let’s build a house while we wait!
Hi from the front row, sitting with my daughter and the dance crew. I’m 70 years old, and I’m enjoying every run so far! Go Badger!
Glad to see such a wholesome runner with such a fun game. My grandmother's cancer has relapsed and she doesnt want to go back to kemo. I agree with what Badger is saying. Everyone here is doing good work. Lets work together to kick cancer.
I Like Pancakes.
Hey Badger, we're with you. Finish strong! Cancer sucks - stretch!
This run has been so much fun to watch. My husband Rob and I love watching GDQ together and even when things don’t go as planned, we still love it. Thanks to the runners, crowd, announcers, staff, and everyone else who makes this event so great! Oh and HONK!
This is Badger's first GDQ? Couldn't tell--obviously it won't be the last. I'm learning so much about Terraria AND preventing cancer!
I forgot about the autoscroller level in Terraria, love it
I know nothing about Terraria, but lord am I emotionally invested. You got this Badger!
HOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!
On behalf of chat, tell Badger we love him and can't get enough of his wholesome personality.
I will lose my father to colon cancer this year wich.... wich is bad. It's the same sickness that took my aunt 5 years ago and it seems like there is a high chance of me getting that too. It's thanks to you guys that people like me have the chance to prevent that from happening in the first place on for that i will forever be grateful.I honestly have never heard of TVGBADGER before but the way this guy is killing that commentary is just too good to not subscribe to him immediately.Thanks for your awesome work and keep up the HYPE!
Seeing Badger so passionate and friendly really warms my heart. I think this is gonna be my favorite run because of Badger's quick thinking and charming personality
This is my favorite part of the Terraria run, because I can actually follow what's happening! Badger, your positivity is awesome, and I'm glad you've brought Terraria to GDQ.
#DonationsForNightTime #Badger
Hi Badger! I've never played Terraria, but you've made it seem like so much fun - I've really enjoyed watching you get through the run. Sure it's been a little dicy, but you've been a joy to watch and such a wonderful runner. Much love and encouragement - you're making the run as awesome as it is (which is very awesome!) You got this!
"honk" is the 11th most used word in donation comments! Let's get it into the top 10! HONK! Also, I love the passion for the game that bubbles out of badger as he talks about Terraria. Very wholesome!
speedrun: HACKED
Donating on behalf of the woman who helped get me into gaming, and saved my life several times over. My mom passed away during the Castlevania block exactly one year ago. I hope that this donation helps to prevent others from going through the pain of losing a loved one mid-fight. If it's allowed, my family is offering another $30 if one of the Zelda relay runners would name their file after my mom, either Teresa or Tree for short. Zelda was her favorite series.
Started watching about 10 years ago. Awesome that this event is still happening. In fact one of my college roommates actually did a run of Donkey Kong Country 3 a few years ago. Keep it up and lets cure cancer!
Hey everyone! I just recently bought Terraria and played it for the first time only two weeks ago and I've been loving it! Any chance I could convince you to craft my favorite item, the Rainbow Rod after the robo bosses?
If you build the guide a house, I'll donate another $25.Really cool run. Loving the Terraria.
First time seeing Badger and I just want to express how much I love his positivity and energy. He seems like a true entertainer and I truly appreciate the vibes he is sending with his commentary. RNG bad, runner incredibly good :D
Loving this run. Let badger finish!
Waiting for the night donation train?
Hey there AGDQ! Long time watcher, first time donator. Glad I managed to peak in, in the middle of a Terraria run. Kinda forgot AGDQ was going haha. My grandmother died of cancer literally the day before AGDQ in 2017 I believe. Whether this gets read live or not, I would like to say that I really appreciate everything that the Prevent Cancer Foundation, Doctors Without Borders, and the GDQ community do. Good luck to everyone with their runs. Here's to breaking $1 million soon!
Put this donation toward time travel research to bring on the night!
Badger, doing great. Good fun so far. I can't really think of a great way to make this donation message terribly much longer.
I’ve never watched GDQ live before so this is absolutely magical. Keep up the wonderful work you guys!
I'm here to buy time for Badger! Good luck brother!
I love speedruns. So when GDQ I love it. Such a noble cause to donate to. Regards from Costa Rica
Marathon Luck is real.
Donating during the Terraria run, can we all figure out how to fix this situation? Picksaw is my guess.Put my donation to the Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition.
Build a house while you wait. <3
Absolutely loving this Badger run. One of my new favourite runners!!
hey hunter, excited for you to come visit. Terraria is one of my favorite runs to watch, due to the fact that theres always something happening on screen, best of luck with the run badger

Hey Badger, I can only imagine the anxiety of having a run go south on such a big stage. I'd be absolutely paralyzed, but you're keeping it going and keeping it positive like a boss! You've got this dude!
shout out to badger's amazing hair!
Working night shift, this might be the only chance I get to see sunshine all week! So I'm happy to sit and enjoy it! Always happy to see new games up on stage!

Hey Badger, never seen you before but so glad to see Terraia at AGDQ, it’s my favorite game. RNG sucks but you’re energy is amazing. Keep it up!
Love it when runs go bad. Donating to pass the time, and because everything is better when WE DO IT LIVE!
Thought I was done donating for today but gotta throw some money in for Badger. Never seen him run before, but he's handling this amazingly. Not easy to have the charisma to carry 15 minutes of dead air. Hang in there, you got this!
First time seeing badger and I love this man. More Donations to read to keep the run alive! You got this
You could always switch to the superior game, StarBound. Also, sealW
Just wanted to donate and comment saying how despite how unfortunate this run's RNG has been, Badger has been an absolute treat to listen to, making this run really engaging and fun! You've got this Badger!!!
Why is it daytime? Aren't badgers nocturnal? (donation to runner's choice)
Decided to do another $25 donation, since it seems we have time. Great cause, great people. Thank you GDQ staff for making this possible! Also, shoutout to my friends watching with me, Calvin and Alien, you guys rule.
Night time donation train HYYYPE
Thank you to all the runners giving us such great experiences this week and for AGDQ for supporting such a great charity. Several of my family members have battled with cancer, so to see such enthusiastic support has meant a lot. Hopefully this will lend a bit of luck with the Terraria speed run!
Hey Badger! Thanks a bunch for playing Terraria for so long! Wishing you luck with the Plantera bulbs - let's aim for a future where your ingame chat reads "Cancer has been defeated!"
I know nothing about Badger or Terraria but I am thoroughly enjoying this run! Keep up the great work, Badger!
Well for the tech issues ;)
So excited to see a Terraria run. Couldn't have picked a better runner to deal with this trainwreck! Go Badger!
Donating for Badger, whose positivity is inspiring! You can do it!
15 extra minutes of badger and this incredible energy? praise RNJesus!

I love Badgers energy with this run! You can do this now, Back on track baby!
Hyped for this 100p1c terraria run!
Aye Great run Badger! Great to see you at GDQ man!
Badger, watching the community come together to support you is just what I needed tonight! Good luck on the rest of the run!
All you had to do to skip to night was use the Deku Scrub's bubble magic to knock your ocarina out of Skull Kid's hand and then play the Song of Double Time!
I checked the leaderboards, and I think this on record pace for the GDQ Co-op run. Just putting that out there.
Badger this run has turned into one of the most honking incredible runs I've seen here and props to everyone in the room for helping to crowdsource this run... MUCH BETTER than any TASBot run. You're a legend!
I only recently purchased Terraria a few days ago, and this run alone has shown how kind the community is.
GO BADGER!!! What an incredible guy. This has been a huge example of why GDQ rocks.
Perseverance through adversity, nice work Badger! Well worth another 15 to fight cancer!
TVGBADGER You can do this! We're all in this together!
This Terraria run, for all that's gone wrong, has been so fun to watch unfold. Never know what's gonna happen next! Badger is a treat to watch and listen to.
Comeback HYPE! Thanks for the entertaining run so far, Badger!
Been so excited for this run for months since you announced it Badger. Good luck. May Plantera bless you with her presence. Also, HONK!
Wanted to donate for one of my favorite games, and learned recently that my grandma have gotten an aggressive type of cancer.Want to give more but hope every bit counts.Lets beat this speedrund and Cancer together!! Best of luck!
Here's 10 dollar for great "teamwork" on a great game.
I can't believe I witnessed the first ever instance of AGDQ plays Terraria. Major props to the runner for staying calm and being such a gracious person.
Thank you to everyone in the gaming community for putting your efforts towards such a great cause. Thanks to the gamers and everyone on the GDQ team.
Amazing runner, one of the most enjoyable runs for me so far, goes to Badger's choice.
Let's get to that half-million!
This guy is great. What a positive and fun experience for everyone. I love watching this every year, it fills my heart with joy!
Can Badger play any more games? Cause I could watch this all night.
So excited to see a game at GDQ that I've actually played, and a speedrunner that can run with the technical punches!
Absolutely love watching my favourite ever game. Don't sweat it, you're doing great!
I love the never say die attitude, BADGER!
Amazing Terraria run! Keep up the great work!
TVGBadger, I've never seen you before, but after watching this run, I hope I'm able to give you a high five on-site at the event. You seem like a real cool dude.

I think this is maybe the best run I've seen at a GDQ. Definitely better than if nothing had gone wrong. Love the positive energy and keep up the good work!
Badgers unending optimism and flexibility were just too much!! Had to donate. What a run.
Donation train for a great runner!
What a wholesome Terraria run!
Go badger! You can do this!

Badger's Terraria run is so incredible. I've seen Terraria before, but nothing is as magical as having the whole crowd working together to come up with a solution to bad RNG. Keep up the good work Badger!
Badgers run is making my day after a 12 hour work day. I don't want it to end, make it day again!! Also HONK

I’ve never played Terraria and Badger is already my favorite runner! I’d wait an hour for that night time!
I'm having a blast watching Badger (and everyone at the studio!) play Terraria. I lost my grandma about four years ago to pancreas cancer, and this is always a hard time of year because of that. Thank you, Badger, for being awesome.Also: Badger badger badger badger mushroom mushroom!
Three zeros! Legendary save by all!
Fantastic Job, Badger! I’ve never played Terraria or even watched a run, but even in the face of a scary delay, you stayed cool, you worked hard, and you got through the worst of it! Thank you so much for dedicating to overcoming these hurdles while helping raise money to help others overcome their own. LETS GO
I cannot help throwing something in to support Badger. He's keeping the positivitiy despite a set back, and that is important. Great Terraria run, never give up!
Thank you so much for handling this run so well, Badger! I hope you return next year for another episode of "Nothing Goes Smoothly at a Marathon"
I look forward to AGDQ every year. This is such a great charity and cause and there's no better time to donate than during this Terraria run as this community comes together to support each other. Thank you for all you do AGDQ Staff, runners amd audience! <3
Love the energy, great run!
Runs like this one are why I keep watching GDQ every time. Pure chaos and a community coming together to play the least amount of a game possible.Also, will there bee any Bees in this run?
FYI Badger, the entire honking game is RNG.
This run has quickly become one of my favorite GDQ runs yet! Three members of my immediate family have been diagnosed with cancer in the last year, so I'm loving all the support for this event! Lets kill Moonlord and cancer!
Only at gdq will you find more plantera bulbs then chlorophite..
Okay I had to donate now to tell you how absolutely entertained I am by this Terraria run. It's amazing seeing this on the fly routing. I got Terraria years ago when it was on sale for like $2 and I've put hundreds of hours on it. Literally one of my favorite games of all time. My grandma passed a couple years ago from colon cancer so this event is always very personal to me and I always think of how much she would love people coming together to do so much good. Keep doing good and good luck on the runs!
Hi Badger! You're doing amazing! My partner and I are rooting for you. The energy you add to the run make it even better. Good luck with the moonlord, have an amazing gdq everyone!
Had to donate after watching Badger and the crew turn a bad situation into an entertaining success!
A Terraria speedrun???? In the words of Phillip J. Fry, "SHUT UP AND TAKE MY MONEY!!!"
Badger, your positivity during your interview turned this into a much watch run for me and your constant optimism during what could have derailed everything has earned this donation to your choice of incentive . Keep up the positive energy!
My boyfriend and I have both played hundreds of hours of this game, and we're truly in awe watching this run. So awesome to see this game at a GDQ, run by someone who loves it as much as we do!
The teamwork I just witnessed in this Terraria run was incredible. Badger you are the man. Here's 20 bucks.
It's been great to get to finally attend a GDQ live after watching it online for the last few years.
This Terraria run is good and wholesome. Excellent work by the runner and the staff.
What a fantastic Terraria run!

Hey badger!! This run is amazing and I'm proud to be experiencing it! Love how you saved the run and I love watching your streams. WR Pace!
Thank you so much for bringing my favorite game to ADGQ... I had to donate! Don't worry about the hiccups, Badger. I may not know everything there is to know about Terraria, but I'm pretty sure we can blame this all on ducks. Incentive goes to Runner's choice.
Hey Badger. I just wanna say you're doing a great job on this run and you have earned a life long fan with it. Keep up the amazing work and much love!
Love watching AGDQ. Keep up the fantastic work, guys!
This Terraria run is too good. Have to make an unexpected bonus donation and badger totally earned a follow. Donation to runner's choice.
Loving the energy, hype, and improvisation :) You rock Badger!
A friend of mine died from cancer today, actually, and I hope this donation goes towards preventing that from happening to anyone else. RIP, Noah.
I know nothing about Terraria but Badger's energy is captivating, and he sounds like a really wholesome guy. Loving the stream!
Props to Badger for that amazing recovery! You got my whole family with no speedrunning knowledge to root for you.
don't play terraria, but i respect the heck out of your ability to keep cool and keeping things fun, badger
Hey Badger! Has my seed treated you well? Really sorry I couldn't offer more, really wanted to, but I hope this helps. Good luck, man!
This is all I can afford to donate this year as I’m currently paying for cancer treatment for my dog. Badger’s energy and positivity is too unreal to not donate during his run. Amazing run! Donation goes to runners choice.
great Terraria run!
What a wholesome guy, congrats on gettin here man
Donating for the first time because BADGER IS AMAZING! GO BADGER!
Had to donate during an amazing game that I have played hours off. Its amazing to see someone beat it in 1 hour.
Hey Badger? You're great. Thank you for this run.
Just wanted to say that Badger's doing a great job, despite the technical difficulties. Money goes to his choice.
This man has had everything possible go wrong and just kept rolling right along. Very entertaining and good at keeping the mood up, thank you badger

Hype for Terraria at GDQ! This is such a positive run.
Badger you are awesome! Thanks for such an awesome run!
HONK!
Really loving the first GDQ of the Decade!!! Can I get a "HONK" from the crowd??
Badger has so much positive energy that I can't help but give
Hey Badger, Just curious, when you and the rest of the terraria speedrunning community were pathing the optimal runs, I imagine you use a specific seed everytime. What made you choose this specific seed with all the variety possible?
Badger, be my dad please, you rule.

3rd time attending AGDQ. Looking forward to the Legend of Zelda relay. Good luck to all the runners!
Can we start a $5 donation train for how great this run is and how positive and wholesome Badger is??
ive been watching a few speedruns for the past 3 years and not once thought of Terraria as a speedgame, This run is so fun, Thanks badger and thanks everyone else for making this fun
Badger is cool
Badger positivity is unreal, had to donate
POSITIVITY HYPE!
500 dollar train anyone?
Watching GDQ with my son and he is living Badgers positivity. We had a good talk about being a good sport in the face of adversity. Thank you!
Thanks for such an optimistic run, Badger! It was a little stressful at points but I never had any fear (one fear though). Here's to a clean and easy finish!
From one Badger to another - you're rocking this run despite everything that's gone wrong. Keep up the positivity and thank you for showing us an entertaining run that no one would have ever expected.
Badger, your positivity is unending. Wife and I are snuggled up, watching you play one of our favorite games on our anniversary. Keep it up, and spread that PMA!

My girlfriend and I are watching this. We had spaghetti. It was nice.Thanks for the killer run Badger
I've never played Terraria before, but Badger's pure awesomeness inspired me to donate during this run, and I'll have to check out this amazing game now. Thanks!
Badger you gained a fan and you earned my donation for GDQ your positive attitude made my tuesday night.
Can someone let the runner know Re-Logic is the developer, not 505 games, the X-Box publisher?
I am really glad that I stayed up for the Terraria run, even tho it's past 4 am for me. But badger is just so entertaining and this run deserves an extra donation.
I used to watch your twitch and replays all the time, suddenly I come back from work you're on AGDQ, helping save lives. First AGDQ, go get'em Badger!
Thank you so much for this run Badger. We all are doing good, but you are doing great!
Badger, your enormous positivity in the face of a tough run has been amazing! Let's kick cancer's butt!
What you are doing is going to help so many people. please keep up the hard work
Thank you so much for coming on Badger!! This is a game I've wanted to play for a while but continue putting it off. This has been a blast and an inspiration to watch! Keep up the positivity and Kick cancer's butt
Was about to give up on trying to debug my program but this run has given me life. Thank you everyone at AGDQ and thank you Badger. Goes to runners choice
This Terraria run is incredible. It was inspiring and heart warming and fun to see Badger navigate the challenges, take the unknown in stride, keep the crowd energized, and to hear and see everyone in the room and on the chat step up to help. Well done Prevent Cancer Foundation, AGDQ, Badger, and every good person listening and involved.
Hey Badger, thank you for the amazing run, encouraging optimism, and your passion with this game! You are truly an inspiring human!
Hey badger, donating for you buddy, great attitude man. Mom went through breast cancer all of 2019, here's hoping for 2020 to bring cancer DOWN!
This donation is just to say that Badger seems to be a really cool guy. I don't know anything about Terraria, much less its community, but this run has been wonderful to watch even if just for the positivity and kindness he so blatantly exudes.
Loving badger and his terraria run. The best one for me so. Keep up the energy.Greetings from germany

Years ago in high school I picked up Terraria thinking it would be a fun detour from Minecraft. It's now one of my most played games in my steam library and I played it even through college. Seeing this run helped remind me why I loved the game in the first place, and now that I have a co-worker that's suffering through chemo and a relative that passed away from cancer, it means more than ever to me to donate to this wonderful cause.
I lost my dad to cancer in 2010, and my mom to cancer this past year, and I love this game, so I'm happy to be here and be able to donate to this cause, and support Terraria, which needs more love.
Amazing run, Badger! These high energy, high positivity runs are what make GDQ great! Keep it up!
Hey fam, can't donate much. You give motivation for those supporting family. Mother is fighting leukemia, and knows people like you have her back.
So far, this is $110 to hopefully reach BADGER!!!BADGERCLAN HYPE!!!! Monkeyman1520 here, YOU ARE AMAZING!!!

Great speed run here. My 6 year old is mesmerised and you've created a new fan of terraria. Keep up the good work!
Badger's positivity has made my whole day!
We need more ORBs, so putting another $25 towards Super Monkey Orb, er, well Super Monkey Ball. Honk!

Thanks Badger, for a highly entertaining Terraria run!
BADGER - you da MVP. This run has been a PLEASURE to watch and your PMA made my day! Keep up the energy!
Nice Run Badger. This has been so much fun because of your positivity.
Have played a ton of Terraria with my best friend (shout out to Lucky!), and am loving seeing it at GDQ!Badger, your positivity is inspiring! Keep it up!
I lost my grandmother to cancer a few years ago and her last message to me was to do good in the world. Badger's message of doing good hit a special place in my heart. So donation goes to runners choice.
Incredible hair, incredible smile, incredible attitude, incredible game, INCREDIBLE CAUSE! Way to go badger!
So hyped for Terraria, let’s get it into future GDQs!
This was a super fun run! Thanks badger
Badger, relax, this is the best GDQ run in years! You’re raising tonnes of money and will double it on YouTube replays!
First time watching badger, great energy with a great attitude. donation goes to runners choice
Throwing my hat in the ring for fighting cancer and some great Terraria gameplay. Shoutout to my best friend, Liude, for getting me into GDQ in the first place. Go Badger! Keep that positivity rolling.
Holy cow, such a positive runner, unbelievable! HONK!
A penny for every hour i've spent in terraria to this point.
Second donation of this GDQ and had to give it up to Badger! Never heard of this streamer before, nor have I ever played Terraria, but this run has been absolutely incredible. Badger please never lose this passion and positivity you've displayed during this run, it's infectious and the world needs more of it, lets kill cancer!
i dont have enough money right now to donate more but i hope this help, thank you so much for what you doing, when i get pay i will give much more... thanks guys. Peace and love.
Had to donate just for the unconditional good vibes in this run. Badger is so entertaining and a great representation of the positive things were here to accomplish.
So far, this is $115 to hopefully reach BADGER!!!BADGERCLAN HYPE!!!! Monkeyman1520 here, YOU ARE AMAZING!!!

This run has achieved legendary status, here's 25.00 to a genuinely entertaining runner who is overcoming tons of obstacles. Keep it up and spread the love! :)
First time donating during AGDQ and it's a real pleasure to donate during this amazing Terraria run! Every donation counts and let's all keep up the amazing work to defeat cancer!
Thanks to a great speed run, my husband and I convinced our friends to purchase and download Terraria! Thanks for such a wonderful run! It's our new favorite!
Mate, I can happily say for everyone watching live and around the world that this is by far one of the most entertaining runs this year, I’m so glad I’ve flown internationally to see this. You’ve done everyone proud and you’ve set a huge standard for everyone else, donation goes to runners choice
Terraria is a fantastic game, but the though of dealing with its RNG in a marathon is terrifying. Badger's amazing positivity throughout this run's speed bumps has been inspiring. Keep being awesome!
Had to donate during this fantastic, super positive and super fun run. Thank you TVGBadger for being so awesome!
So far, this is $120 to hopefully reach BADGER!!!BADGERCLAN HYPE!!!! Monkeyman1520 here, YOU ARE AMAZING!!!

Definitely not forgetting this run! Twitch chat is loving you Badger!
This is the greatest mediocre run I've ever seen.Thanks for being so entertaining and positive, Badger. You rock!
Not even an hour ago my best friend's brother called me and told me their mother had passed away from the aftereffects of stomach cancer. The brothers host party games for our friends every Sunday night, and one of the games we played together was Terraria, about a year ago. This small contribution goes out to their mother, and my hope that one day, no son should ever have to make that call again.
Really love Badger and Terraria, that speedrun seems pretty intense. Love the positivity.
Last time this year I lost a dear friend to complications due to leukemia. He, like this run, never gave up no matter what hardship he faced, and I know he would be proud of what everyone has accomplished here. You guys are truly amazing!
You have no idea how much Dirt Blocks sell for overseas. Enough for this donation!First time donating, props to Badger on a run as unreal as your forges want to be!
I absolutely love Terraria, it has given tons of great memories over the years, with more still coming. To me it was always a game about making the best of what you're dealt, so this was a perfect speedrun.
I don't think my previous Donation went through, so I'm doubling it for this 'glorious' run.Runs like this one are why I keep watching GDQ every time. Pure chaos and a community coming together to play the least amount of a game possible.
Thank you for the amazing run! My husband and I look forward to gdq. Favorite run by far!
Let Badger's run go as long as he wants. We need more people like him in the world. Much love
Bless your heart Badger
Hi Badger, seeing all this positivity has inspired me to donate! I lost a family member to cancer before I was born, and it's lovely to see this event taking cancer head-on. Also, I wish I was half as positive as you!
First time donating after years of watching. Hopefully next year it'll land closer to a paycheck but I do what I can for now. Big blow finding out my grandfather was confirmed to have cancer a few months ago. Looking forward to the zelda relay, and i really hope you have it in your heart to save the animals
My good friend Jeremy and I used to play Terraria before he passed. He didn't pass from cancer, but he would have loved to support this run and event. Thank you for everything you all do.
I have never played Terraria a before, but this is my favorite run so far. Your positivity is infectious, and can’t help but show my appreciation. My mental health has suffered lately, but the only tears I’m crying tonight are tears of laughter. Thank you for being a sensational human being. Much love!
Because Badger losing it at the donations has to be rewarded. This also goes out to the staff behind the cameras. Thank you for covering up so much of the madness. LET THE RUNNER SUFFER!

give youRSELF MYSTERIOUS TABLET
This is for Badger! Most entertaining run <3
I don't know what's going on, but this is going to Badger's choice.
This is for the $500 train and in memory of my mother who passed away this holiday from cancer
I know I sound like a broken record, but Badger's energy is amazing! I've been telling myself "I'm going to donate this year" but procrastinating. Badger's positivity got me up off my butt! Great run. Better showmanship.
First time in a place where I can donate, and what a run!
TVGBADGER, you're breathtaking.
All the love for Badger <3
Never forget “Money” Badger
<3 Badger
Go Badge
That terraria run was UNFORGETTABLE. Choo choo on the donation train~
BRING BACK BADGER NEXT GDQ SO HE CAN SHOW US MOONLORD! Still a great entertaining run!
New Incentive, Terraria Speedrun by Badger TAKE TWO?
So glad I got to catch the end of Badger "The moneymakers" run. Also HONK!
I feel bad for the Terraria runner, things go wrong sometimes and it happens to everyone. I hope he's not too stressed out, he gave a great run!
Hello, Screevo here, ALTTP speedrun community resident dad dropping in to tell Blunt, Josh, TGH, and the Z1/Z2 runners good luck, have fun, go fast, and don't hug the pig.
HAd to donate during the Zelda block, SHout out to all the rando runners, also Animals respawn frames dont. put this to killing the animals!
tvgBadger is amazing
Did it go over time? Sure. Did we have a great time? Absolutely.Thank you for the amazing run, Badger.
GDQ when it's going right is a super tight concerto. GDQ when the rails come off is super fun jazz.
Badger, you're a wonderful person, even though everything went completely sideways on you in your run. Thanks for staying so positive and happy the whole time!
Loving all of the positivity and energy, even in the face of disaster! Lets use that energy to destroy cancer!
This is for TVGBadger’s amazing energy. A perfect example of why GDQ is so great!
I enjoy GDQ as much as everyone else and maybe one day I'll beable to go but right now I am enjoying it with my new born baby girl, born last month. We both really enjoyed Badger's run even though he couldn't finish it was still great! I love his attitude and the tricks i will have to try at another time to play that game some more. Badger's choice for Incentive!
What an amazing night at AGDQ! Badger, your run was delightful and inspiring.
TVGBADGER! What a fun run! Thank you so much for your optimism and cheer. I hope you all are enjoying visiting my hometown for GDQ this year! ZELDA HYPE!
thank you!
Whatever I just watched was absolutely amazing! Never got around to playing Terraria properly but I enjoyed that run nonetheless! Thank you Badger!

I’ve been watching AGDQ for years and never had enough to donate, but I always promised myself to donate when I could and now I can! Here’s to all you incredible people doing all this for such an amazing cause. I also wanna give a special shout out to all the LGBTQ gamers and speed runners. What a beautiful inclusive community. Keep doing what you’re doing! Hi Jonathan!
The Zelda Series followed by Final Fantasy 8, all in one night, for over 12 hours of epicness! I hope the three energy drinks, gallon of tea, and pile of unfinished craft projects will ensure I stay awake for all of this! Good luck to the Zelda racers and the Final Fantasy crew!
Inspired by Badger’s positivity! Money’s been a bit tight this month, but that run made me realize that there are definitely good causes to put this toward. Here’s to a great GDQ, and to kicking cancer to the curb!
Really looking forward to this Zelda race! Sad I won't be able to stay up for all of it, but it'll be great to watch later. Donation goes to last-place finisher's choice!
Love GDQ. Highlight of the Year so far!
Here with my annual AGDQ donation. This goes out to my mother who battled and beat cancer twice. Thank you for doing a relay of one of the best video game series of all time. I love you all for doing this and keep the great speed runs going!
I always watch GDQ and I'm very excited for the zelda run! Good luck to the runners.
Cancer has hurt my friends and family too much. Hope this helps. Hyah!
Have to donate for one of my favorite game series of all time, and for the unbeatable positive attitude of the runners!
I can't do much, but here's the money I would normally spend on evil cheat food - New Years Resolutions and all! :PI have a special connection to Link to the Past because I associate it with my dad, who used to know every single thing about this game and could beat it, dare I say, almost as fast as a speedrunner. GDQ, keep being you and keep bringing us awesome crazy runs each year!P.S.: Have you SEEN those awesome prizes? :D
Love the energy the folks at GDQ, runners and supporters, are bringing for such a great cause. Let's keep up the hype and make a difference against Cancer! HONK!
Have to donate during the Zelda Relay! I'm a new runner and just starting to learn ALTTP and ALTTPR runs! Thank you to the runners and all the LoZ Streamers who reminded me how much I love these games!
Shoutout to everyone involved, Sent, i know you'll conquer them geese! keep doing awesome stuff!
Had to donate after that Terraria run, a shame it couldn't be finished but Badge absolutely killed it with the positivity.
How much do we need to raise to bring Badger back on stage?
For Badger! Great Run!
Epic runs of Punch Out and Terraria, but I'm gonna have to catch the Zelda Series run and FF8 on the YouTube uploads with my husband later. Rock on, GDQ!
In memory of my Dad who also loved the LoZ series
Love love loved that Terraria run!
Super hyped for this Zelda relay - honk!And a special hello to AlmightyBobino who's there in the room, from a friend in PRS!
First time Donating. Let's see the end of cancer in our lifetimes
AHHH MORE EEVEE MERCH (This will be a recurring theme)
is this the stream that is going to speedrun the games that will have the mighty hero Eponur and their mighty steed "Herp-Skerp Lonk"? No? ok. #gbird
That was a great Terraria run. Really enjoyed all the personality the runner brought with them. Here's $10 toward the OOT Glitch Exhibition. Keep up the great work.
Donating on behalf of Badger! What an incredible run by an incredibly charismatic guy.
Here take this!!!
May the Goddesses of Power, Courage, Wisdom.....and RNG be with all runners. Good luck everyone.
Second time donating! Props to all the runners and the staff and the energy they put into these events! Happy 10th anniversary GDQ!
I need that Eevee perler in my life.
Terraria was amazing. Go Badger!
I’ve been playing through Terraria for the first time for the last few months so was excited to see Badger’s run. I’ve been watching AGDQ for a few years now but listening to him talk about everything PCF does convinced me to donate for the first time. So great to see such positive energy and actions!
Hey GDQ, looking forward to the Zelda relay race! Never seen them run back to back so looking forward to it! This goes twards the Animorphs Bonus game
BADGER!!! OMG, dude great run! So much great energy. Thank you and all of the community here at GDQ. I loss my Mom to Cancer a little under 2 years ago, and I have to say, the good vibes here and by Badger... Well she would have loved it. Best crowd source speed run ever. This is what the community is about. Thank you!
AGDQ has been an incredible event so far! I am especially psyched for this classic zelda relay. Here is a 202 rupee donation to account for the amount needed to get through the first leg. Good luck runners, and...... HONK!
That Punch-Out run was unbelievable.We also need to see Animorphs. I expect similar levels of quality.
I am donating during my favorite game series in honor of my Dad, who was fortunate enough to beat non hodgkin's lymphoma a couple years ago. Keep up the good work, both in the event and the fight against cancer.
Bring back Badger
Throwing my support for my favorite pokemon, #79. Can’t wait for that Punch Out run later, too.
Cant wait for the relay, that Zant cross stitch also looks incredible!
Go racers! Love this community and all it does for the world. Zelda(Link) block hype!
Had to donate for the Legend of Zelda.
Thanks for years of entertainment and charity!
Badger has brought such a positive energy tonight. As a cancer survivor, I can't express how important positivity and kind words are for those who are struggling with illness. Thank you Badger, and thank you to everyone at AGDQ for all your hard work. Let's beat cancer together!!
It’s dangerous to speedrun alone. Take this
So much love for Badger - I loved all the knowledge and passion you had for your game, for living life to the fullest, and for being good people! I can't give $500, but every bit counts, right?
mrow!
You seen the news about Hava?Hava nice day!
La Hee
Zelda Relay Hype!
As a resident of Aus, we've got our own brand of chaos happening here, but I'll always make time for this amazing cause in memory of my Grandparents. Love and miss you John and Pat.
well howdy there pardners keep it up game players
Omg Rez, look at those tinks dude! You guys make this game look "simpol." Love you guys! P.S. let's hear it for the commentators!
I love you GDQ! I love you runners! You guys do amazing work!
Final Fantasy VIII HYPE!
Donate each marathon during the various Zelda runs. Super excited to see the Zelda series relay. My son Lincoln (Link), loves Cadence of Hyrule and we can't wait to see that run, as well! Donation goes to double time Cadence of Hyrule to really amp things up!
Zelda race!!!! Let’s do this!!!!
Oh my hero, so far away now- oh wait, wrong Final Fantasy music.
For Badger's awesome Terraria run and the amazing upcoming Zelda relay! Y'all are amazing! Thanks for doing so much to help fight cancer!
First time donator, long time watcher. Thank you all so much for everything you do! It's been so great to hear about the amazing impact this event has had worldwide. Good luck to all the Zelda runners!
Take this!
It’s dangerous to go alone, take this!
This one if for my grandma, who casually kicked breast cancer's HONK twice. She does not understand what a speed run is in the slightest, but said the event was "lovely" nonetheless. And I'll throw in an extra $25 if announcer can either pronounce my name correctly, or is wrong enough that it makes me laugh.
So excited for the Legend of Zelda relay. It's not a secret to everybody, donations are a courageous way to help the fight against cancer.
For my friend Rob. Day 5 into cancer treatment. It may take your jaw and your teeth and your face, but it's not touching your spirit. Does anyone know how to fix a stuck '2' key?
Sup, y'all! Donating to this amazing cause and loving the energy and love from everyone involved! I have to put in my first donation during the Zelda run, because I just love this series so much. Good luck to all of the runners! May the Triforce be with you!
Honk? Honk!? Hoooooooooonk!!!!!!!
Let's get a $10 train going to help defeat cancer!
Choo Choo
Such a great event, so many speedruns I’m looking forward too! Thank you to everyone who help put together this event and thank you too everyone who donates!!!!
Take this donation! It's dangerous to go alone.
I love the OC Remixes played during the breaks! Shout out to whoever put the playlist together.
I can't give 500, but I wanted to hop on the donation train and shout out Badger for his infectious enthusiasm! Such a fun run, and happy to help out with such an important cause.
It's not $500, sadly, but all the same be proud of that phenomenal run, Badger. If only we could all have such poise.
Bring back Badger!
AGDQ is my favorite thing to come around ever summer and January. Thank you so much and rock on!
ive been watching gdq for the last 7 years and happy to donate yet again , zelda always been my favorite serie and cant wait to watch all those speed runs , i will add another 25 $ donation if my name is name is said correctly , donation goes to announcers choice

Congrats to everyone on a fantastic AGDQ!!! Here's to a great Zelda speedrun! Best of luck to all the runners today and the rest of the week!
First time donater. I may not be attending agdq, but since i'm a local I got to meet a bunch of great people today. This donation for every dab on the mummy ride attempted during a picture.
Tonight, squall will be the best looking guy here.
My mother passed away from lung cancer a year and half ago. One of my fondest memories of her was watching her play Zelda when I was little. Thank you for raising awareness and funds to fight cancer.
honk
I've been waiting for this relay all week!
Just wanted to thank cantaloupeme for the spoon; it really came in handy.
Hooray!
Thank you for an amazing event! In memory of my Dad who passed from cancer 2 years ago.
Badger’s recent run highlights what I so love about this event and this community, positivity, encouragement, and people coming together to do good. Thank you to all the runners, staff, and volunteers for making this event so very special.

How long can i donate for that amazing hylian shield replica?
So hyped for this relay! It's a tri...fecta of triforce!
Hip! Hup! Hiyaaa!
My mom was diagnosed with cancer last year, and I couldn't think of a better way to help the community than to donate and stomp cancer. And with zelda being one of my favorite games, what better than to donate to stop cancer and watch my favorite game. Thank you for all to all the streamers and volunteers for this wonderful event.
Here's some rupees for the blue ring; remember it's dangerous out there.
I took off all week for GDQ, and am super-hyped for tonight's FF8 run. Donation goes to the blindfolded menuing because, even if Luz can't see it, YOU have to.
Hello! 4th year watcher, first time donator here! AGDQ means a lot to me since my grandmother passed away in 2010 from colon cancer, and my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2019. Luckily, she is in remission now, so what could be a better time to donate to AGDQ? This is in honor for both of the strongest women in my life. Good luck to all the speed runners this week, especially all the Zelda runners out there!
It's too dangerous to go alone, play with two friends instead! Had to donate for all of the incredible Zelda runners in this relay! May your combined powers lead you to the triforce!
Had to get in a donation during the Zelda series. Much thanks to all the amazing tech crew, volunteers, and of course, runners in this event!
Speedrunning always needs singing!! Put this towards Eyes on Me performed live during Final Fantasy 8!
Honk to the Zelda relay
honkity honk honk
Premier don de la semaine, merci encore LFR pour ce fantastique évènement dans la bonne humeur quel que soit l'heure, continuez de bourrer les dons contre le cancer, hâte de voir ce relais zelda #monalink
Super excited for some Zelda and Final Fantasy! It's so cool to see so many people coming together to fight cancer. Let's keep this excitement going! Shout out to my best friend Liude for introducing me to GDQ. I'm happy to do my part.
hydration for the third bonus game.
Lost my grandmother to cancer a few months ago. Happy to do my part in joining the fight against this terrible disease. Zelda HYPE!
Long time watcher, first time donor! Super, super happy to donate during the Legend of Zelda. These runs are amazing! Putting this toward the Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition, those glitches are WILD!
Did GDQ leak Zelda 3 before the direct tomorrow?!
Coucou aux courageux de la nuit, continuez, vous faites du super taf. #ConseilDes4
Excited to see the final fantasy VIII run, good luck to the runner and can I get a “HONK” from the audience
Badger was an inspiration to watch. He obviously cares so much for AGDQ and for this great cause. Grateful to be able to show support for both his dedicated heart and the great cause. Like Terraria, let's help build a world without cancer.
That was the silliest but adorable Terraria run I've ever seen. Kudos to Badger and all his new team of adoring fans. I'm happy myself to have survived cancer twice now, and have been 5 years clean and clear! While not well off, I always try to donate a little to these events now. Here's to kicking cancers butt so hard it never comes back!
It's nearly 4am here in Scotland but had to stay up to watch some Zelda! Can we get a HONK please?
Zelda Hype! Keep it up and have fun!
Hey good people! Greetings from Italy! A friend of mine is fighting right now and needs all your energy! So please honk! your positive energy for everyone fighting and for my friend Chupita!
Hi everyone! I'm sending this donation from Brazil. First time donating and it feels really good to do it. I love this event and it's easily the best week of the whole year. Thank you all so much!
It absolutely boggles my mind how much this event has morphed over these past 10 years. I've followed GDQ since AGDQ 2016. The amount of support this community gives is absolutely amazing and I can't wait to see this all continue growing and supporting such an amazing cause. Thank you to everyone for all your contributions and especially to the staff, volunteers and runners that can make this all happen!! GDQ Hype.
Shout of to everyone in the crowd, ya'll keeping it hype for the runners! Especially the dancing floppy ears in the front row, you're rocking it!
It's always a great time to watch GDQ but it's even more fun now watching it with my daughter who was even more excited me. A shout out to my daughter Ellie who just beat her first Zelda game ever Links Awakening
Wake up in the middle of the night, see I'm just in time for the Zelda Relay. Let's go! HONK!
So exited for the Zelda run about to start. Good luck to all the runners!

A Zelda relay sounds absolutely fantastic, and will be a great way to round out the night for the many of us who will be going to bed afterwards!

Only ever watched vods before and am SO excited to finally watch live and donate! Hoping to be there in person next year but for now good luck on the run!
Zelda Relay Hype!
I've been following GDQ online for the last year, have to donate now that I get a chance to see some of my favorite game runs live. Go Link! Defeat Gannon and cancer!
Love the white bunny ears hat dance in the front row ^¬^ Drink water!
Best of luck to all the runners in the Zelda Relay!

Greetings from Germany, so Hyped for the Zelda Relay
Cancer's gotta stop trying to take my friends and family, happy to support this amazing charity and drop some cash on the Zelda series run.It's dangerous to go alone, take HYYYYPE!
To one of my best friends, Zsisron, I know you've been going through hard times, but know that I believe in you and that you can succeed no matter what!
here is to the best gaming series of all time! good luck to all the runners in this LEGENDARY challenge!
The Legend Of Zelda is one of the first games I can remember... Not the first three, though I remember those being hard as hell as well. Knowing there are runners completely crushing these game makes me feel very eager to help! So here, take a purple and three blue rupees! And let's make cancer nothing but a rupoor memory
Haven't been able to donate for the last couple GDQs because life, but glad to be able to do so again now. Hope to never miss a donation again.
I just love it when the Zeldas go fast!
Here's to fighting cancer. My mother just under went surgery for melanoma today. Let's keep the fight going with the tenacity that Badger showed trying to salvage his run. With the same positive mental attitude.
Hey everyone. Had to donate for one of my greatest franchises of all time. Thanks for all the great runs and let's make cancer a thing of the past!
Badger was absolutely amazing. Have a Bring Back Badger Incentive! The chat is asking for it! :)
Been looking forward to this run all week. The Zelda series has meant so much to me in so many ways, as I'm sure it has many other folks here, so it's so exciting to get to watch 3 of the best ones (heck yeah, including II) back to back and for such a great cause. Have a happy and safe GDQ everyone!

This is the third GDQ that my wife and I have watched, and we've enjoyed every second of it! My wife's been a big Zelda fan since she was a little girl. Unfortunately, the sort of games I usually play don't make for good speedruns. How WOULD you speedrun a flight simulator, anyways? Good luck to all the runners!
Can't wait for the Zelda relay!!!

Keep up the good work.I normally donate a bit later, but I just wanted to shoutout Badger for just being awesome to watch. I've never even played Terraria and I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I know the run didn't finish, but does it even matter? It was a blast and he raised a ton of money doing it.

$10 train HYPE! Donation to runner's choice.
Badger's run was simply amazing! There is a lot of pressure being up on stage in front of everyone and trying to do your best to perform, and when things start to fail and not go as planned, the pressure mounts even more. Badger keeping his positivity throughout the whole run was simply amazing and really showed a ton of perseverance. A lot of grace under pressure. Thank you to everyone who makes an event like this possible to help make the world a better place. Thank you.

I lost my dad to cancer as a kid, and he donated his body to science in hope that he would help other families avoid the same loss. Every AGDQ my family watches and feel so touched by this genuine and sincere community, and I see that same selflessness from everyone involved. Here's to saving lives, one glitch at a time!
Hi Kyle(GreenMario),It was a blast hanging out with you at AWA last year and I can't wait for it to be that time of year again. I also haven't forgotten about those SF 3rd strike matches you owe me at some point! Good luck to you and your team on the race!

Hey runners! I'm stoked I can donate during a Zelda stream! I actually lost my mom to breast cancer at age 10 and whenever she heard the theme song, she liked to image Link slicing away the cancer cells. Glad that the money can go to such a great cause!
I'm not one for clever comments. Whoever is reading this can put it to whatever incentive they want.
My kids love watching this! Save the animals!
Had to donate during the Zelda relay, but they forgot to add the best Zelda game of all time Majoras Mask. Don't @ me. Good luck to all the racers!

I'm so hyped to see this Zelda run! I hope to see many more in future GDQs!!!
Zelda Time? Zelda Time.
This is my first chance to donate to a gdq, so of course I had to pick during a zelda themed run. As per usual I am in awe of the skill of those who do these runs. Kick cancers butt, and let it know it is as useless/annoying as tingle.
Played these for the first time with my boyfriend a few months ago. My mind is blown by how much faster this is!
I always love tuning into each GDQ and I'm glad I can start contributing to a great cause.
Go GreenMario! Congrats on making it to AGDQ and an amazing run.
I’ve been looking forward to this race since I saw the schedule. Link to the Past is one of my favorite games of all time. Best of luck to the runners!
Good luck! I hope Zelda can save the princess!

Hey folks! Cute Monster Props here checking in during one of my favorite game series. Zelda has been one of my favorite fantasy series and speed running it makes it even more entertaining. I've made, and will keep making Zelda props for a long long time and I'm happy to share them with y'all to contribute to preventing a disease that has affected many of my loved ones. Shout out to my Yetee family at the event. I'll donate another $25 if the crowd shows a little SPIRIT for my ORBs that are a prize during the relay.
My dad was diagnosed with colon cancer this past year. We were lucky and his doctor was able to detect and remove the tumor before it even had a chance! Gladly donating some money which will help others catch this disease early. Bravo to the whole team at GDQ and all the runners for putting on a great show and bringing in some big money to save lives!

Much love to everyone involved in planning the marathon and keeping it running so smoothly! And good luck to all the runners!
Happy to donate during this awesome relay! Have to put down towards the Glitch showcase for Ocarina of Time! Be great to unwind after a long day at work with the soothing sounds of "Hiyaa, Hiy-Hiy-Hiy-Hiyaa Hiyaa Hiy-hiy-hiy-HiyaaaaH!" Soothing white noise... ^.^zZzZz

Zelda 2 hype!
Thanks for putting together my most anticipated part of the week. Much love to the Zelda community. I hope you all get the chance to relax afterward with two shrimps and a cocktail.
Don't read this. ;)
Loving the relay race of my favorite series of all time, Half Million HYPE!!!!
My wife has been battling cancer for about a year now. She is the strongest person I've ever met and she has endured more than anyone should ever have to endure. Together we can help detect and prevent cancer sooner so fewer people have to deal the hardships so many already have had to endure. I wish to thank you all for the amazing work you do to make GDQ happen, and thanks to every one donating to this amazing cause.
Good luck Zelda runners! 500K hyyyyyyyypeeeee!!!!!!
get your flu shot if you haven't yet it's not too late! also lets go vriska squad
Hey everybody. Sad I can’t be there to watch in person, but donating a bowly (red rupee) to some of my favorite Zelda runners. Glad to see everyone representing the great community for the series. Donation to JSR’s choice, as long as it’s a thing.
Getting in on that $10 train! I will also donate an additional $10 for every death in the Zelda relay.
I spent like five minutes trying to figure out how I missed a Zelda 3 before I realized it was ALLTP WHAT'S UP
Which one of them is playing as Zelda? It's hard to tell on the screen
Up working late, nice to have some company :)
Hey, everyone! My partner and I are currently in school studying nursing and computer science, and love GDQ for bringing our two biggest interests together to so much good for so many in need. Donation goes to winner's choice. Good luck, runners!
Just wanted to be a part of this magic.
Did you see that Mandhandla get... manhandled? What, someone didn't Like-Like that pun? Hopefully no one was too rupeed off by these because it bombed. Wisdom says they can Goron and on, but if you have the courage to Link them together well enough, your collective groan will just power them more.
Congrats on FIVE HUNDY! Here's more MONEY!
it's 11:11 PM here in EST, and I'm wishing for a record-breaking GDQ!!
Hey Pro_jn, don't forget about old shrimps!

Holy cow, this Zelda race is HYPE! We're sitting down to watch it as a family and having a blast! AGDQ always a good time for a good cause, and I look forward to it every year! Here's to nipping cancer in the bud!
The Legend of Zelda series has brought me much peace and serenity amid what feels like endless cycles of medical issues. I am always overjoyed to watch Zelda speedruns to bask in the nostalgia and comfort that all the music and sound effects still conjure up.Thank YOU, you the person hearing this now, for what YOU are doing to make the world better. Love, Rynn <--[rhymes with "win"]
I would make a Zelda pun, but I don't want to Tri and Force it!
First time ever donating! So excited to contribute to this move and worthy cause!
Games Done Quick is the best content on the internet. Thank you for all the years of hard work, good times, and worthy charity you've provided. Honk-HYYYYYYYYYPE!

Cheers to Cantaloupe's 1,043rd and final run of the Legend of Zelda Any% - No Up+A! There may have been a few setbacks, but it was still a spectacular introductory performance to see for Team Peahat! I'll need to see Cantaloupeme run Silver Surfer and Karnov for the next GDQ! Love ya man!
This one's for Mike! He hates donation and love so I have to love TWICE as much!
I feel your pain, Cantelope
Link, m'boy, I can't wait to go eat an octorok!
My grandmother was recently diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and started her first round of chemo today. I have watched for years but this is my first donation. Thank you for the great work supporting those going through such trying times.
Lets yaaaaah! the cancer!
I heard there was a $5 train a-rollin'! Choo choooooooo
I've somehow never seen Zelda 2 played ever, so this second part of the relay is pretty interesting. Much love to everyone involved with AGDQ. Glad to do my part to raise money for cancer prevention.
$500k Keep up the good work. Also ill sub if someone does their best realistic honk. <345
I heard an EoN... Hi EoN!

I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer, and my friend's brother has a really bad brain tumor. Let's kick cancer's butt the way these runners are kicking these games' butt. It's Zelda time, so how about a HONK! from the audience?
Been watching GDQ for I don't know how many years now, first time donating and had to be during my favorite franchise. Great work all, thanks for the show!
I love watching gdq with my wonderful partner who introduced me to the fantastic event

I had to donate during the Zelda relay, great run so far! GDQ is always my favorite time of year, and I'm so glad I'm able to donate to such an amazing cause.
Giving up sleep tonight to watch the Zelda relay. Totally worth it. Let's get to 550k before the race is over!
Badger isn't done bringing in money just because Terraria's over. Vote "Badger" for Squall's name!
Always watched GDQ since 5 years back and it's amazing to see so many speedrunners in one place, as always keep speedrunning and be awesome, GO SWEDEN!

Shout-out to canteloupeme for giving it the old fashioned try! It's all good man! Keep going with the speed runs!
Zelda 2 is one of the first NES games I owned, and it's awesome to see pros speedrun through it. Watch out for huge bots!
Love AGDQ, and Zelda. I can’t think of a better time to donate!
I’m not Swedish....but go Sweden!! Let’s get that 550,000 peeps!! Wooooooooo!!!!
These relay races are my favorite runs of the recent GDQ events. Loving this Zelda race and can't wait for the Mario Maker 2 race on Saturday! Keep up the great work GDQ staff!

It's absolutely amazing how much we've manage to raise in just a couple days. My Fiance and I love watching GDQ every year and I just HAD to donate during this Zelda race. Love you Renan! Rooting for Team Sittin' Sidewayz and donation goes to couch's choice.
Had to donate during my favorite series of games growing up, can I get a “Well excuse me princess?”
Couldn't ask for a better group of Zelda 2 runners for this relay. Good luck Rez, Justin, and JN....but I'm rooting for team LilZ.
First time donor here: I love Zelda! Good luck on the run. Have fun and don't give up!
Long-time watcher, first time donating, but I had to drop some money during the 2d Zelda games. Best of luck to all the runners
Hi Mom
EEVEE :) <3
Here's $25 towards singing Snake Eater. Thanks for all you do every year!
3 Zelda Games in one run? What amazing madness is this?
Badger was such a wholesome and positive runner, let’s keep up the PMA and more donations!
Had to donate during Zelda. I lost my aunt to cancer last year so it feels extra important to me to donate this winter. Thank you all for making GDQ such an amazing event. Let's play some video games and fight cancer!!
$50 donation train
Whoa runner wearing sweet Death hoodie! Rest in peace Chuck
Birthday donation train? Happy Birthday to Panda Bear-rett!
I can't remember if I donated yet this GDQ, so why not during one of my favorite games? Congratulations on 10 years of GDQ, and good luck to all the runners!
Blowing my mind to see the amazing runners for Classic Zelda. The donation goes towards the Omega Weapon Fight I'm curious how to break this encounter.
one of the first speed runs i've ever seen was link to the past, so it's a real treat to see a relay of one of my favorite series make its debut at GDQ.Speed running has not only brought me friends i've needed through rough times, but has encouraged me to continue trying even when things are really bad.to all my speed running friends: you give me the strength, knowledge and courage to keep going and you're all a constant inspiration.congratulations to all runners participating in the event and thank you GDQ for putting on an event for such a great cause!
Thanks for another great event, GDQ. Love the runs, but also your noble cause - preventing cancer.
(I feel unoriginal now but) my big sister asks people to donate money to various places every year for her birthday, so this one's for her. Hap Birth Taylor. (another 10 if i can get this read) <3
So hype to watch 3 games from my favorite series be completely and utterly destroyed, Especially Zelda 2 which is the only main series Zelda game I’ve never been able to beat (Death Mountain ughhhhh). And all this followed by a game in my next favorite series. OoT was the game that made me a gamer, and FF8 was the game the first FF game I ever played, and the game that made me a JRPG fan for life. Super exciting for all these runs and good luck to all the runners!
LOOK AT THOSE TINKS DUDE!!! love all the runners....umm let's hear it for the commentators too!
Zelda relay hype! Shout outs to my Zelda 2 family! Love you guys. Weeeeee!
This donation in honor of getting Goomy to SGDQ! And Vriska ::::)
AGDQ and SGDQ are such amazing events. My Grandmother passed away due to cancer and I am proud to donate every year. Thank you so much to the event coordinators, staff, volunteers, commentators, and of course the runners for helping make these events so successful.Let’s aim to beat last years donation total! HYPE!!!!
I just wanted to show some appreciation for the run by Badger. His positivity is magical, and he brightened up my night. Please put this towards Squall's name!
Still rolling from the badger hype!
Bring back Badger!
Good luck to all the runners!
Well, when I said we could easily make 500K by the end of the day this morning, I was only half joking... awesome work everyone, let's keep up the donations, and drop a downward stab right into Cancer's forehead!
You all know this feeling when you wake up in front of the stream and feel the sudden need to throw the last bucks of your christmas-money at this beautiful project?Let's kill cancer!
Long time watcher, first time donor. Spent many days playing Zelda 1 and Link To The Past while caring for a grandmother who was battling cancer. Donating $5 for everyone in my family that lost their fight. Here’s to Wisdom, Power, Courage and most importantly: Hope.
Love watching speed runners destroy the games that I felt were so hard as a child. Huge shout out to all the commentators, runners, and all those missing sleep to donate to a great cause
Ha ha ha! Return of Ganon!
VRISKA VRISKA VRISKA
For Nemo2342, who supported me when I lost my husband to cancer. Stay warm & well, my friend.
Sorry about the bad luck before! This has been an incredible stretch of runs in the last few hours and I haven't been able to look away. Zelda is my all time favorite series. If I was a Swanna I might say HONK but since I'm not I'll say ARF ARF!
How can I not donate to a great cause (fighting cancer), while watching a great group of runners absolutely Manhandle-uh few great games? Be careful with the spicy chickens, and dine on two shrimps and a cocktail. Thanks for all that you do.
Dod-HONK-o dislikes cancer almost as much as he dislikes smoke.
There once was a Legend named Link,and a princess, usually in pink,A pig has now clenched her,it's time for AdventureAnd then to the Past he must Link
My uncle passed away this time last year, 25 years with Tampa Police DPT, fought the good fight against stage 4 pancreatic cancer till the end. Moved to be part of a community of gamers that continue the fight against cancer. Game on!
Had to donate during the Zelda relay.... because it's dangerous to postpone!
GG Cantaloupeme. Congrats on over one thousand runs. You are a legend.
Rooting for our runners to take down Cancer Ganon!
Hello from france, i have been watching agdq for a long time now but this is my first time donating. Bonne chance à tous !
Because Red is my Favorite Color, Here's 20 Rupees for the Zelda run!
It's dangerous to go alone. Take this! Remember, please use your Twitch prime and spare bits! This is an amazing event and amazing cause. I love all of you! Let's kick cancer's ass! Save the frames, kill the animals!
Vriska did a lot wrong so let's let her redeem herself in Final Fantasy 8.
I can't help but donate again for what is easily the most emotional a run has ever made me.
Zelda 2 is one of the first games I remember really getting into. So happy to see this live, in a relay race! AGDQ/SGDQ are some of the highlights of the year for me and I love the schedule this time around. $50 going to the Ocarina glitch exhibition, love watching the games broken so hard!
Hello GDQ I have been a fan for many years and look forward to the events you host every year as they are so much fun. Now let's beat the cancer because if we can beat three Zelda game in under four hours we can beat cancer.
His name is Zelda, only if he is made from grapes from the Zelda region of France.
I have one grandma who's survived cancer twice, but lost 2 other grandparents to cancer, so I'm more than glad to donate. Shout out to GDQ for putting on a good show and raising money for great causes. Also putting money towards Animorphs as a bonus game, 'cause everyone needs to see this run at least once in their life.
Keep up the good work guys n gals.
Badger isn't done bringing in money just because Terraria's over. Putting this toward "Badger" for Squall's name!
Love Zelda, the Zelda community, and GDQ. Thanks a million to today’s awesome runners!
I was so excited when I heard there was a zelda relay. Imagine my surprise when I realized it wasnt the CDi games!
Fairies scare me too.
This is the weirdest Mario World Randomizer seed I've ever seen
Which member of every team is the player of Wisdom, Power and Courage?
So glad I got involved in the Zelda community, I had a blast racing with you all last year and I am looking forward to more. Good luck to all the runners, and a huge thanks to GDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
Honk!Towards Legends Of Localization book please
Legend of Honk!
I have been watching this show for about 4 years now. Donating wasn't even in my mind. Then it hit me! I love GDQ soo much!!
I came for the Zelda speed runs, but enjoyed the great run of Terraria by Badger! He may be my new favorite streamer, his energy was contagious! Loving this co-op Zelda relay race! Looking forward to A Link to the Past!!!
Hello GDQ! Long time watcher, first time donator and I couldn't pick a better time to do it. I started playing the legend of Zelda series with my mom when I was 7 and have been playing ever sense. Ill donate $10 dollars for every other Zelda run that I have time to watch!
500K on the third night? That is amazing. Really glad I made it home from work in time to see the Zelda Relay Race. All three of these games are classics and should be shown as much as possible. And to celebrate these gems; let's get to 600K by the end of this race!
Heya AGDQ! Really exciting to watch this Zelda series relay. It's always very inspiring to see you all gathered, running and raising. Hope I can fly from France again sometime. Thanks for all the great times & greater deeds. HONK
Speed run of Link: The Faces of Evil when?
Greetings from Aus! This donation is dedicated to Pro-JN; After his Zelda II run at AGDQ2015, I reached out to him with tips to starting out with the Zelda II community for running, and he welcomed me into one of the nicest communities I've ever been a part of. Whilst I'm not too active in the Zelda II community anymore, I'll never forget how amazingly welcome everyone is. Donation goes to JN's choice!
tonight the force--i mean TRIforce was with GDQ.Can't wait to see that fat pig Ganon get his butt kicked more than one!.. Or was his name Lance?Thanks to all the runners and GDQ, thank you for all you do for such a great cause!
im not not swedish, so lets go sweden HYPE
Can't wait to catch the FF8 run when my infant son inevitably wakes me up in the middle of the night!
Great run, great runners, but here’s 10 dollars to oppose Sweden and all its doings!
Oh. When I saw that it was going to be a Zelda series marathon, I thought it would be Faces of Evil, Wand of Gamelon, and Zelda's Adventure. Still, I guess the NES/SNES ones are good too. Keep up the awesome race action for a good cause, everyone!
Good luck to all the runners! Here's a joke for you. Do you know why Ganon doesn't use the internet? Too many Links!
My son Bravey had his tonsils taken out today so he is enjoying sitting around watching this awesome Zelda series run.
Loving the marathon so far, had to donate during such an amazing race. Let's go 600k hype...?

i havent missed a gdq since 2012. im always so proud to see the great show the runners and staff put on for such a great cause.
Hey GDQ! Today is my birthday, but unfortunately the first one without my mother, as she passed away from cancer this past fall. Zelda is near and dear to my heart and so is she, so here is to preventing cancer and to this awesome Zelda relay!
This is an amazing race in an iconic series. The Legend of Zelda was an important part of my childhood when it came out. Shout out to my brother, Jeff, who grew up with the Zelda series as well, and shares the love of retro gaming with his daughters. Congrats to all runners and staff. Especially the unseen crew behind the scenes who keep it all running. MVP's everyone!

Go team PRO_TGMH.
I would like this to show up during the Ocarina of Time speedrun by ZFG. The love story between ZFG and Banjo will start with the filename. Thank you for the inspiration, ZFG and thank you GDQ for your hard work towards fighting cancer.
CHOO CHOO
Can't get enough of the Zelda relay! Good luck to the runners!
Sauvez Pif!
Can we get a relay of the CDi Zelda trilogy at SGDQ?
I feel like I need to balance things out here. FOR THE ALLIANCE!
Won $50 this last weekend, figured to donate once more today after donating blood.
This race is a ton of fun! Good luck everyone!
I’m up way too early here in Sweden to watch Pro_JN play Zelda. Worth it. Good luck from Shuv-deh.
Hey guys, I just wanted to thank you all for how much this event does to raise support and awareness for the Prevent Cancer Foundation. My Granny Ann had fought cancer since before I had been born before passing a bit over a year ago, and my other Grandmother is getting ready to start another round of chemo. Nothing would make me happier than to see the world without this terrible illness, and you guys are not only helping work towards that goal, but also brightening up my day. Thanks everybody.
Here to start a 5.00 train with the all-important question: what is everyone's favourite Legend of Zelda and why is it Twilight Princess?
My first GDQ! I wish everyone the best of luck, and although I don't have any dad jokes rest assured I will be repeating them at random to my dad.
$20.20 TRAIN CHOO CHO!
Zelda 2 has been my favorite game of the series since I was a kid, and I always love watching speedrun of it, but this relay has been amazing!
Chugging along the Vriska train, choo-choo! Shout out to my wife Prumm, I love you! HONK(x8)!!!!
Let's have another 10 years of GDQ! HYPE!
Good luck on your Banjo run
Just going to leave this donation here. “Fairy” thee well!
Honk: he come to town.
Love from ZFG's chat! We know he's been meaning to put time aside to play Banjo Kazooie, but with all that Ocarina of Time practise he never gets the chance. We figure he should get a chance to play as Banjo at least!(feel free to read it closer to the run, when the incentive comes up)
$20.20 train!
Love the Zelda series! Donating for a great cause and great run! Kick butt and take names!
video games
Loving AGDQ so far. Need to get on this $20.20 train and put my money towards naming Squall's name in FFVIII being Badger after his incredible run!
Hey listen! We're doing a great job pushing those numbers higher and higher! Shout to the runners and the staff keeping this event going! Heres to many more!
Zelda puns? I'm afraid I can't Link of any!
Can we get the crowd to do one big Tim Allen/Home Improvement grunt? Do it for Wilson! ahhhuuaaahhhhhh
If we start a Zelda donation train, would it run on the Spirit Tracks?
All these Zelda puns must be a Majora pain!
Hey everyone, hope you're all enjoying the event as much as I am so far. I lost my dad to cancer 20 years ago this winter, and my sister is now in her second battle with cancer. This donation is in honor of my sister. For great justice, take off every runner! Let's give cancer a bad time. And as my dad used to say, "Be cool, but don't be a fool!"
FIRST robotics team 5448 loves the Zelda marathon, and hopes to see $600K!
Donating for Ocarina of Time filename: BanjoThe OOt run will be neat
I would never want to diminish capabilities of these donation trains.
TRI-FORCE-ATHALON is the best pun I could come up with. I sincerely apologize.
Looking forward to watching zfg run NSR. Here's $25 to naming the file "Banjo." Shoutout to zfg's chat. zfgRunOgre
Long time watcher, first time donator!! Love agdq and all the nostalgic games I’ve played when I was in my childhood
Zelda II is one of my all time favorite games to this day - I play it at least once and a year and I'm starting to think I should take up running this one. I'll donate 25 more if you say my name correctly
Don't worry, puns will come. It's better to way than try to force it.
This is a Zelda pun... but it's not very good.
More puns? That's Barba-ric.
I've heard of a good way to beat Gannon! I'll send the link :)
You guys want a pun? I'll Epona up some dough and give you one.
Great race. It can be FAIRY difficult to come up with the puns for Zelda. The runners are on FIRE though
if we Tri to Force that Triforce pun too hard, they’ll send us to the pun-itentiary.
Just because Terraria's over doesn't mean Badger's done bringing in money! Putting this toward "Badger" for Squall's name!
Can someone send a Link to more zelda puns please? that would be legendary. please, do goron. we don't want to miss out on the missing link.
Hey listen!We've got to get some puns to octorock your socks off!It's fairy easy to make them!Let's link up and get a donation pun train going!It's Ganon be a good time!
If Nintendo made a commercial rocketship to mars and back, what would they call it? A Link Between Worlds.
I am glad everyone is doing so well playing as Zelda! Honk!
Grimchuk win faster so you can play WoW with us! We miss you bud - Shwreck
Love seeing these runners LINK up for a real LEGENDary race...look, I know I TRIFORCEd those puns, gimme a break.
Wholesome Boi Hype Train!
First time donating, long time watcher. I lost a Second Mom to cancer. So I am happy to donate for this awesome cause. GDQ HYPE!
Forget the puns. I just hope all 3 teams can sn-Aghanim-ble time through Link to the Past.
Did someone ask for pun donations? In the rare occurance where speed doesn't work, Tri Force
I got your pun covered. Link just turned that dragon into BARBA-Q Ribs! Looking forward to see if these runners can make that Quantum Leap past Scott Beakula in the Great Palace! Everyone on the couch and Z2 community know exactly what I'm talking about. :)
These puns are driving me Cucco!!
WEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
A few things: 1. Awesome race so far everyone!Good luck in "HONK to the Past."2. Always wear sunscreen.3. Go figure that the speed running community would be all about routing around cancer!PS: you know what to do (honk) if you're looking forward to future runs of upcoming Untitled Link Game.
What happens to the hero of Hyrule after he pounds an energy drink? He becomes a Hyper Link.
Why is Ganondorf so afraid of the internet... because of all the Links :D
I can still hear the collective pun groan from the tip of the west coast. Free us from the pun onslaught!!!!
Why couldn't Gabon surf the internet?There are too many Links!
Where would Ganon keep Link if he got captured? A cell... duh.
I hope Ganon gets locked in a Zel da would never be opened again. ;)
Long time GDQ fan! Keep up the great work! Hyrule Warriors is best Zelda game, fite me.
I just happen to be drinking out of a Zelda mug right now. Coincidence? I Link not!
I was a little bit lost at how to donate, There are lots of LINKS on the screen.
It's past *MIDNA-ight* on the east coast, and there's nothing else I'd rather be doing <3
Pun time? I busted out ten of my best in hopes of having one that would beat everyone else's, but unfortunately, no pun in ten did...
You heard about that prehistoric Hero of Time?The Missing Link
I recently played all the Zelda games and now I have more respect for the older games so I am happy to see them beat so much quicker than I could ever do it.
Loving the Zelda race. I guess if the runners normal strats don't work they can always triforce.
Hi :)
Hey GDQ, cheers from Brazil! Been watching you guys for 2 years now and I absolutely love the event, the cause and all the runs. This donation goes to have Raijin in Blazing Chrome, an amazing brazillian game that fills me with pride to see it being run on GQD. Best of luck to all runners!
Watching the runners Navi-gate these Zelda games so fast is incredible! Every year they're Revali-ng new strats, how do they Fi-nd them all? I'm stay up past Midna-ight to find out how this race ends!
Hope nobody's zora 'bout these puns!
SHIELD yourself, I'm about to JUMP into a very ham-fisted attempt at that punLIFE. Though I'm FAIRYly sure that some will cause groans, others may be straightFIRE and REFLECT some of the awesomeness of this event. And thatSPELLs fun to me!
Zelda has always been one of my favorite games, and TGH is one of my favorite speedrunners, had to donate during the Zelda race! Go team Pro_TGMH!
Zelda...He a cool boy....or girl...i can never remember. well it's the title so it must be zelda. GL runners
We need more puns. Gibdos puns! #gbird
Shout out to the entire A Link To The Past community and my boy Fricker in the commentator's booth. An awesome community for an awesome game. <3
As promised, here's my donation for the eco keys, plus some extra for the exciting race!
With a name like mine how could i not donate during the zelda race.
All these puns are just fineBut I prefer an Ocarina of Rhyme
I hear people want more Zelda puns during this race...You have so many pun-filled donations to Rito us, which must be exhausting. But I'm going to Goron a pun spree anyways. I'm sorry, I know this is so freakin Gerudo-f me. I would have done this differently if I Zora nother way to give the people what they want. But it's Hylian-likely that anything other than puns would satisfy them. So here you are. :)
I'm going to take these puns and raise you a word avalanche.I imagine at the end of ALttP that Zelda wouldn't want to keep the prison she was held in around. In fact, I bet that Zelda sells the cell that Zelda cell'd at.
I'm not the best with Zelda puns. I hope Minish okay.
A link to the Past i Love it lets get a 5 $ Donation train going chuchu
What was Link's favorite dance in the 90s? The M'Ocarina!(Also, don't forget to drink some water)
Hey All, Yetee Here. Zelda puns, huh?Ok let me try.You GoRUN the games really fast, I'll ZELLDA shirts for charity. The Link is on the twitch channel.
Link to the Past! LET'S GOOOOOOOOO!! Also, Emister, thanks for being an awesome older brother! Love ya, duder!
I'm so excited to see my favorite childhood game, A Link to the Past, be destroyed by three runners!
I always look forward to GDQ, but this one takes on a special significance after my Dad died of pancreatic cancer last month. Here's a donation towards fewer people going through that in the future. Love and miss you lots, Dad, and huge thanks to the runners, organizers, and Prevent Cancer Foundation!
Wanna know how to defeat Ganon over the internet? Simple. Just send him a Link.
The 'Key' to a good pun is the hook-shot and sinker... Did I mess that up?
I hope we can get a Zelda pun train going, but I wouldn't triforcing it.
Where did Link find the princess? In her cell, duh.
ZELDAAAAAAAAA!!!!!
Bonjour, GDQ! Great to see the audience practicing their French. Ouiiiiiiii!
Bats and rats and snakes, oh my!
I thought I was too poe to donate, but I found my adult wallet. This race has been bomb! I gan-non get enough, and these racers have been destroying my childhood nightmares! I'll be watching and listening to my favorite song: Gerudo Sandstorm. Anyway, good luck in a link to the past, and remember, if you are struggling, Triforce!
AAAAAARRRRGGH(us)! Could you guys gibdos puns a rest? They armos definitely note funny; you could at least trinex time. ... What? You disagree? I guess I'll have to gohma own way then, as I cast a kholdstare back at you.
Didn't even know gdq was happening until earlier today, but glad I didn't miss Legend of Zelda!
Absolutely loving this Legend of Zelda relay! Thanks to all the runners for putting on such a great show, and thanks for PCF for all the incredible work they're doing to save lives! Let's hit $550k during this relay!!!
Shoutout to the Girl Gamers Discord! Our Game series of the Month for December was the Legend of Zelda =)
This donation is brought to you by the Kholdstare Creamery, where every scoop comes with 400 calories and 4 hearts of damage.
Fun fact: A lot of people mistakenly refer to the guy in the green shirt as Zelda. In fact Zelda is the doctor who created him. In the games you play as Zelda;s monster.
Vriska
Good luck to my ALTTP pals -- I'm rooting for you all. Shoutouts to my friend JoshRTA -- here's hoping you can get some GOOD Dungeon Bomb Jumps. Get that 1:23, dodge the cactus.
I bet I'll get the Kholdstare for these bad puns, but we can't be Blind to the fact that they aren't Gohmaing away anytime soon.
I Really *Like-Like* making puns, I can *Goron* about it all night long!
Rollin in with the 123 58 donation for my boy blunt. Also, joshEYES
If possible, save for the start of the FF8 run. Thank you!Dear mates, as I texted Kev before I went to bed. I am so incredibly proud of all of you. Missing you all very much, but know that I'm here in spirit, eating goldfish and jerky enjoying this run very much. Check in on you later, good luck, go fast, bring your calculators, and someone bring out the recorder solos.Also, any unironic Arianna Grande fans in the building? If so, donate to the Blindfold menu. I've seen it before in person. You WILL be amazed.
I had to kick out a donation during my favorite game of all time, A Link to the Past. I love watching this game and love running it (albeit poorly). Special shoutout to Fricker22 for helping me learn this game.
Can we twilight these puns?
As a Historian, you guys do realize this is out of order? Regardless I can certify that these runs are 100% historically accurate
You guys rule!
Hi guys, love AGDQ i watch it every year, this year im donating as my best friends mum was diagnosed with cancer and I wanted to donate this in support of her, good luck to the runners and have a great rest of the week everyone!
Choo Choo gdqDealWithIt
I don't have any puns, just a love of zelda, the runners, the volunteers, the donors and everything about this amazing week every year. My dad has been cancer free for 25 years thanks to early detection and raising money to help that happen for others couldn't be better.
Link to the past? More like link to the FAST! I could watch you play a-ganon again! You guys hy-rule! Keep up the great work!! HYAH!
Thank you for all the runs for this very Agahnim-portant cause!
What's the best piece of advice to give to a scared Goron? Be boulder.Apparently people like these Zelda puns, but I Zant understand why.Here's to a great rest of the race, rest of the week, and rest of the marathon.Please put this donation towards the FF8 Ultima Weapon Battle.
I love the history of Zella series. Lonk to the before time is my all time favorite! Good luck runners!
Great job to all the Zelda runners and Team Peahat for getting right back into the race after an unfortunate end to Zelda 1! Shoutout to all my friends that made it out to GDQ and looking forward to hearing the runners sing One Winged Angel... Er, Eyes on Me!
I would tell you my best Zelda pun but “it’s a secret to everybody.” Great race and HONk!
Zelda me the Pizza Mario
This text to speech bot is very lifelike
I’m bad at puns, so somebody make your own Wand of Gamelon joke here
it's dangerous to go alone, take this
Excellent race! Link to the Past is totally the best Zelda game, and the runners' performance is Tek-tight! (Mandatory Zelda pun.)
Hey all. Loving the stream and what you guys are supporting. A few years ago, I lost my friend to cancer, and my girlfriend almost lost her grandma this past summer. Thankfully grandma is in remission and has been stable. Looking forward to watching the rest of the runs.WHEEEEEE!
Wanted to support TGH during his run! Just breathe, TGH, you can do this!
Donating during the Zelda relay ! Incentive goes to the Honk’arina of time glitch exhibition. My friends grand father passed away on new year due to cancer so I’m donating to prevent more people from getting cancer !
Always have loved GDQ and have to donate for this amazing LoZ relay. Duck 🐔Cancer! #ZeldaGlitch
My puns are OK-rina. A bad Zelda pun is really a Longshot. So far i've like-liked every single one. And hearing this many shouldn't be a biggoron deal. I hope all the runners have a Majora Fun-time and i hope GDQ has to upgrade to a giant's wallet to hold all the donations coming in this year.
My mother passed in cancer this summer. Have to donate in her memory to the greatest Zelda ever made
Watching amazing games ran by fantastic runners and donating to a great cause. Couldn't be better. Thank you GDQ for continuing to make these spectacular events!
Heard you like puns. What do you call Zelda's photo album? A link to the past
No puns. Just first time donating. Great night so far!
Can't wait to watch this run. This is the only Final Fantasy I haven't played, super excited to learn about a new AWESOME game in the series!
So happy right now. The finest Zelda on the finest speedrunning event. Link cancer to the past!
Doing my part.
Farfetched Zelda puns? Got you covered. How would you describe the lore of a situation where the final boss of A Link to the Past does not have a boar head? Not ganon.
Great to see the zelda speed run in teams cause after all, it's dangerous to go alone! Thanks to everyone at GDQ for all their hard work for charity!
Good luck to the relay runners, and may the puns not be Termina-ted!
Just wanted to donate to this awesome event and say thank you for all that you guys do.
HONK
Confirm/deny: I hear the only reason Link's Awakening wasn't included in this relay is that the story is non-Ganon-ical
Hey guys! I’m not very punny.. just wanted to say that Linkle is the best Legend of Zelda character of all time, don’t @ me. XD
Just because Terraria's over doesn't mean Badger's done bringing in money! Putting this toward "Badger" for Squall's name!
This relay seems like a Shiek way to run these games. It's incredible to see the Link Between Worlds as the runners cycle to the next one. Each team is a real Triforce of Heroes, and no matter how many Faces of Evil they go up against they persevere. Link's Crossbow Training is too hard to work into a pun...
Events like this serve to Link the community to Like Like minds so that we can help others with our hobby! With Power, Wisdom, and Courage we can Tri to Force cancer out!
It's dangerous to go alone... take this.
This donation is in memory of Alice; she was a trans girl like myself, and we both came out online in cirno_tv's chat at about the same time, but sadly she passed away in August from cancer. Thank you all for putting this together, and for striving for a future where nobody will suffer the same fate. Can I get a "trans rights"?
I’m having to split my donation with donating to help the Australian Firefighters but I can never miss a GDQ. Especially during one of the best games from my childhood. Love seeing all the LttP glitches.
HONK!
Sitting here with my infant son introducing him to the wonders of Zelda. Here’s to a cancer free world that he can live in. HYYYYYPPPE from Sydney, Australia - also can I get a big HONK from the audience and runners for my son.
3$ More for each BlueBall we gonna see at all 3 Players. Greetings from Germany !
What did Link say to cancer?I'm going to Dek-U!
I will try to force a pun: bomchu
I just wanted to say that I love you all unconditionally!
I suppose I could LAN-MOLA some puns on you but the audience seems to find them AGA-nizing. I have BLIND faith that Team Peahat can MOLD a way to WORM their way back atop the PEDESTAL and win this race. Donation to Announcer’s choice. Can we hear some 550k HYPE to reach the mark by the end of the race?
wheeeeeeeeee!!!!!!
I love you Sumi!!Excited to hear you perform again :).
Not all heroes wear sword and shield. Together we can beat cancer by donating some changes that we've wanted to GERUDO-f.
Happy Birthday BluntBunny!! 🎉🎂🎊🎈 congrats on 1:23 and Good Luck with your run Weeeeeeeee
Love watching this every year and being able to see the Zelda relay is amazing! Keep up the great work everyone!
No Zelda puns, but I do have to donate in the name of Toni and Tony, both taken far too soon by cancer. And my dad, Jim, who was diagnosed with mesothelioma and faced the inevitable with incredible grace and courage. Seeing three of my favorite childhood games played amazingly well in the spirit of making a world where nobody has to go through that warms my heart and brings tears to my eyes. Thanks GDQ and cheers to the amazing runners.
All Ganons Die Quick. Let's shine a lantern in that dark world of cancer.
Hello from the second row! This is my first GDQ in person and it will not be my last!Puns, huh? I'll admit that I'm not FAIRY good at them. But 5 bucks for charity?SHUT UP AND TAKE MY RUPPES!
Let's make Squall Badger!
There is a 25 year old save file on my Link to The Past SNES cartridge from when my Dad first completed the game so this game is near and dear to my heart.Thanks to early detection my mom was able to catch her cervical cancer early enough that she didn't need chemotherapy and got the cancer completely removed through surgery. Thank you GDQ for everything your organization does. ♡♡♡♡I just asked my boyfriend for a pun and he said I Dudongo... hah
Fight the good fight.
All hail Koji Kondo. The Dark World theme is easily my favorite song from the Zelda series. Let’s get that 550K Orb! And what are the chances I could get another, “Well excuuuuuussssse me princess!”?
i don't have a good pun for link to the past right now. i'll tri nexxt time. incentive to Green Mario's choice
I set my text notification to the LTTP text noise, so every time I watch a speedrun, I feel so popular. Had to donate during one of my favorite games of all time. I could never beat Skull Woods as a kid; please wreck it for me! Love from the front row.
I heard there was a $10 train? Hope I'm not to late. No puns here, just want to see cancer dead. Thank you everyone at GDQ for doing what you do!
Loving the Zelda relay, good luck to all the runners! Can't wait to loose the goose, honk!
Mah boi, this speed is what all true warriors strive for!
Screevo here one more time. Fricker, those 15 blue ball odds are 1 in 32768. Yes I have that number memorized. 15 blue balls is definitely Agah-nizing.
These puns are driving me Cucco!! Keep up the good work runners and am looking forward to the rest of the runs this week! BEYOND!
Gotta go fast! Let's get to $550,000!
Have to work full time so I can't tune in. Here's some apology money.
Go runners go! I can't stop donating!!!!
I see Zelda, I donate. 550k HYYYYPEEE
3$ for each BlueBall means 30 in total. Thanks evreyone for this awesome Event.
Here's a dollar for every blue ball. Put this towards naming Squall "Badger"
Just because Terraria's over doesn't mean Badger's done bringing in money! Putting this toward "Badger" for Squall's name!
It's been so exciting watching this Zelda relay race! As someone who has struggled through cancer myself, I am eternally grateful to the entire AGDQ staff and runners for organizing this amazing event every year! Go team Sittin' Sidewayz! You can do it! HONK
There's 100,000 people watching on Twitch right now. If everyone donates just the minimum of 5 Rupees, we can hit 1,000,000 Rupees before this Zelda Relay is over! Let's go!
This Zelda relay has been great so far and I couldn't think of a better time to donate! All of the runners have been amazing! Always great to see the community come together for a great cause! Also shoutout to Fricker killing it on comms! Let's hit 550k!
I Armos-t wasn't able to donate, but I was able to Navi-gate the Links. Seriously though this pun train is amazing and I'm glad its all going to such a great cause. I work with cancer in the lab and hope Prevent Cancer can help banish cancer for good!
Three of the greatest classic adventure games? Check.Nine of the greatest speedrunners? Check.Racing at the greatest charity fundraiser? Check and check.Sounds like an amazing time!Good luck to everyone, but I have to be a bit biased: GOOOOOOO TGH
Weird to see a Zelda 3 run without Andy. But remember even though you all aren't actually a hero in green tights. You are all doing inspiring things to help provide entertainment and your time for a great cause! And remember.... Drink water
The Legend of Zelda Series has always been my favorite. Watching you guys play has been a blast...the puns have been alright too.
Badger is so positive!!!!
Fun runs. Keep up the good work.
Yesterday I met a Nintendo fan who wanted to be a biker. I asked him how he was going to do that. He said, "I'm going to get Miyamoto cycle."
Q: What did Link find when he accidentally put his laundry through the hot cycle?A: A Diminished Cap.
The Legend of Zelda was always my favorite game series growing up. Seeing these Zelda games done so fast and in a row has been an amazing treat. Keep up the great job and let’s kick cancer to the curb!
My aunt and I used to play Zelda 1 and ALTTP together before she passed away. I've just started learning to run ALTTP and the community is fantastic. Thank you, everybody. Let's beat cancer!
Q : Why was Ganon's Email hacked...? A: "He clicked on a Suspicious Link"
Thanks you!
What band do you get when you have a hero looking for a job at an outside recreational area?LinkedIn Park.
One dollar for every blue ball from Aghanim.
I'll give you guys another $20 if you've pronounced my name right! Go Team Sittin' Sideways!
Thank you GDQ for doing what you do. A Link to the Past is one of my all-time favorite games so it's great to see it played by three runners simultaneously! Truly a TRI-force for good! Good luck to all the runners!
Do what you guys are doing.
Sup AGDQ from Québec.
I'm not great at puns, and I don't want to BYRNA-ny bridges, so this donation message might be a mis-QUAKE. but i got online to browse the NET this morning and as i RED MAIL, i got a notice that AGDQ was going on this week! I try to watch and donate every event, so I sat down, turned on the stream and invited everyone in the house to come-MIRROR they might miss it!Anyways, it's always great to see fantastic runners BOOK it through my favorite games, and SHOV-ALL obstacles out of their path. Put this donation to ETHER of the winning team member's choices!...Hookshot pun.
Absolutely loving the Zelda relay race and all the other fantastic runs this GDQ. Big shoutout to all the people that work hard to make this event run smoothly! 550K hype! Donation goes to naming Squall "Badger" in FF8.
Just finished watching 300 and now want to see a Link to the Past movie. I think Zelda fits Gerald.
Hi there! So glad I can finally donate after watching GDQ for two years now! I'm so thankful that there is a community dedicated on raising charity events by using speedruns to hype people up! Shout out to my friend, Aliensthetical, for introducing me to GDQ! Courageous vibes to our fellow Link-runners!
It is truly remarkable the love that can be spread from people joining together and playing video games! Absolutely love GDQ, a spectacle of human compassion that is unmatched.
Who inspired Flute Boy to write that brilliant ocarina song? I bet it was Link In Park.
The Legend of AGDQ: Making Cancer A Thing of the PastAwesome run, everybody. 550k hype!
It's dangerous... in general!Take this!!!
You say that Hyrule used to be better when the king was in charge? OK Boomerang.
Happy to once again donate every GamesDoneQuick! Watching all of these amazing runs makes the week go faster. Hoping to hit that 50k before this run is Zel-done!
The Speedrun Community always has a special Place in my heart, because everyone from the runners to the viewers is so supportive.Keep on going and save those frames!
First time donator here but have watched GDQ for some years. Good morning from Sweden. Lost my best friend 3 years ago due to cancer, so its nice to see my favorite childhood game being run by be 3 people at the same time, best of luck and thanks for an awesome event.

Mah boi. These speedruns are what all true warriors strive for.
Sending some love from TEXAS! Pancakes or Waffles?
BADGER BADGER BADGER BADGER
Zelda has a special place in my heart and so does my mom. She beat cancer once already and just got diagnosed before christmas and she is on the path to beating it again. Lets beat these games and cancer together and keep up the good fight!
My boyfriend and I have a long standing... disagreement about the best Zelda game. He claims it's Wind Waker. I say it's Twilight Princess. Help us put this to rest once and for all.
My mother is a breast cancer Survivor, and need to help others defeat cancer.
First time German, long time donator. Greetings from watcher.
Long time watcher, second time donator. Perfect time to donate during Zelda race. Oh and wait... HONK!!!!
Good luck everyone! But if you lose, take heart. It will just start an awesome alternate timeline.
Shout out from the front row! Thanks to all the runners and commentary team! Team Lil Z HYPE!
I'm making this donation on behalf of jay20extreme and Truly_not_a_salad from Badger's Discord community, and to get Squall's name to be Badger.
I'm so sad I can't make the final fantasy run but I guess I should be responsible and go to my life-science job benefitting from all fo you amazing, kind, caring, and wonderful gamers. It's thanks to you that we can accelerate the advancement of life-science and cancer research. Thank you. Now let's get that omega weapon incentive!
From the audience: if everyone here donates $5 now we’ll only be 10k away from 550k! Let’s start a train!
Good work gamers we are so close to our goal!!!! Together we can make cancer a thing of the past!! I have had two family members lose their battle with cancer and I cannot wait to wake up in a world where this stupid disease doesn't exist anymore. Love Zelda and the runners. Keep it up!!!!!!!!
The Legend of Zelda is my favorite game series ever. Glad to see so many runs at GDQ. Reminded to the runners, the true horror of the dark world is that they only have the Philips CD-i Zelda games
Hey AGDQ! I've been loving the runs so far and it's only set to get better, especially when my boy Muttski shows us how to Disc 2 Final Fantasy 8! Cancer has a history in my family and so far we have three survivors staying strong, my mom being the most recent of the three who has recently finished all her treatments. Let's do all we can to hit cancer with our limit breaks and show it who is the real boss!Peace out, good luck to all the runners and their remaining runs, can we get a HONK? and remember, Eiko Sucks!
Been watching GDQ for a long time. Keep up the great work.
Hey Everybody,long time watcher, first time donator. :)I cant wait for the Final Fantasy 7 Run to start. <3Wish you all a beautyfull night Keep up the good work :-*Warm greetings from Germany
Had to donate during my favorite game series being ran, and as a race at that! My mom survived breast cancer and couldn't have done it without the research these charities provide. Glad to see GDQ helping out so much and more than happy to donate. Go teams, kick Ganon's butt!
Made it back from work in time for my favorite game. Put this 25 towards animorphs.
I tried to game the announcer before, didn't quite work!Anyway, I just finished seeing the HYPE run of Chrono Trigger for SGDQ, and I come into AGDQ 2020 on ANOTHER legendary SNES game! Good luck to everyone (especially Team Sittin' Sidewayz), and thank you all for donating to kill cancer dead!
ganon has smol pp
#SaveTheHotdogs You know it makes sense! Shout outs to Luz, Tojju and my main man Muttski. Good Luck on the run, Eiko Sucks
First time donating but I had to donate for my boy TGH and all of the Link to the Past NMG and Randomizer communities good luck on the run TGH and skewer cancer like you skewer that pig.
I've played through all the Legend of Zelda games by myself plenty of times, but I never imagined that Zelda could be such an enjoyable shared experience. Watching this relay race has made me realize that these games are really meant to be played with other people.I don't think I'll ever WAND to GAMELON ever again.
Couldn't figure out if I wanted to donate during the Zelda or Final Fantasy runs. $10 now and $10 as soon as it starts. Thanks GDQ!
Speedrunners eat Zelda bosses for breakfast while I eat my own breakfast. What better combination is there?Greetings from Germany
Hey GDQ, been watching for about 5 years, and i've decided to donate this time. Good luck to all of the runners!
Someone please make sure Cantaloupe is okay? He looks like he's having a rough time
I hope Zelda gets to kiss the princess at the end!
Watching a legend of Zelda speedrun with my cat who is named Zelda! Both of us love what you guys do and had to donate! Zelda says "meow".
A haikuLet us meet the goalWe can hit 55kZelda is the boy?
Had to donate during the Zelda relay. Lost my mom to cancer a few years back and wanted this to go to helping others. Keep up the good work and Go Fast.
Thank you to everyone who puts on this event, what a great show and cause. Watching this run now with my Warcraft guild and sharing my own passion for speedruns with them. Good luck to the runners in the final stretch!

I love that we are all here, using video games to make the world a better place!Take that! all those who said video games were a waste of time :PDonation goes to TEAM PEAHAT for: continuing to fight, even when things were not looking promising; way to be an example for all of those battling cancer!and a big thank you to everybody who helps to make GDQ possible.
Such an amazing relay! All the runners have been great, and Link to the Past has always been my favorite!
Happy AGDQ everyone! I've been watching for 5 years now, and I love it every year. Keep up the great runs, runners!
I grew up with all the Zelda games! A Link to the Past is one of my favorites! Its great to see eberyone coming together and enjoying themselves in this relay! Keep up the good work runners ans announcers! Cancer has taken multiple people from me so lets beat this!
I beat cancer when I was 15 and now I'm finally being able to finally make a donation while watching these awesome Zelda runs with my boyfriend. This is the best thing in the world and the best revenge I could've had on the disease. Keep hope everyone.
Hey all, Salzbot here! This is dedicated to Cantaloupe from the twitterverse! Will donate again if I can hear the crowd's hype for Canta and the rest of the runners. You rock Canta!!!
Let's Tri and Force cancer out of our lives.
I had a whole year to think of something clever to say here. Got nothing. So I guess I'll just honk the hype train and wish the runners good luck!
Anyone know a good place to buy spaghetti online? I need that Link to the Pasta.
Seeing these Zelda games speed by is amazing, but I wish it could 'Goron' forever!
[fr] merci au french restream et bourrons tous les don
Always love AGDQ - and proud that MAGFest is an event sponsor as well! *Colossus Roar!*
Hi Everyone! Just wanted to say thank you to the commentators of this run. I am not very familiar with those particular Zelda games, but i've been able to understand most of what's happening on my screen!
Legend of Zelda was a favorite of mine growing up. Awesome to see it being ran in GDQ. Let’s show cancer... I mean Ganon who’s boss Kupo!
Who is Links favorite Final Fantasy character? It's Zell, duh.
Gaming has always been my passion and Zelda has always been my go to game. I am so happy and filled with so much excitment to see everyone come together to kick cancer to the curb!
Greetings from Aersia! Let's seal cancer away to the Dark World!
TGH is a god gamer. Loving the relay!
Cancer sucks, Zelda rules, and thanks for the awesome runs!
I love these games with all my heart. The runners and commentators have been great. This donation goes to winner's choice, so long as its cool.

My sister recently lost her battle with Ovarian Cancer so this time around this event means even more when I donate. Great job to the runners
Me: 3 fairies and struggling with ganonSpeedrunner: 2 hearts and makes it look easy.Great runs all around.
Premier don pour cette AGDQ qui est merveilleuse, il faut plus de bourre-pif sur angelo. Merci à tous pour cet événement qui lutte toujours contre le cancer #TempeteDivine
Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite right behind 4. I gotta see this whole run, and I HAVE to see Omega Weapon destroyed, since I never could do it myself. Good luck runners!
Longtime watcher, first time donator! I am genuinely excited to stay up til the wee hours of the morning in order to catch every moment of the Final Fantasy 8 run! I just had to make my first ever donation at a GDQ go towards defeating Omega Weapon, as well as changing Rinoa's name to Vriska, because I know Vriska would want to be a hero in a game that has an "8" in the title! Good luck to the runners and thank you AGDQ for another phenomenal week of speedruns!
Amazing Zelda runs. Use this donation to help beat cancer.
First time attending a GDQ live. Couldn’t be more excited to be here in person. The atmosphere is amazing and surreal to finally see one of my favorite charities in work. Thank you so much GDQ for all you do! OH BOB!
Our roommate's mother was just diagnosed with cancer, so it feels appropriate to donate during one of my favorite games of all time to support this important cause. Good luck on FF VIII, Runners!.......
Thanks for keeping my sick girlfriend entertained for the past days. MGS3 Snake Eater more like Snake Beater, amirite?
Bourre Pif! #GDQup
Let's use our speed strats to smash both these runs AND cancer! Good luck, honk, and go fast runners!
Lost my Grandmother to Breast Cancer 5 years ago, not long afterwards I discovered AGDQ, and I have watched it every year since, and thanks to the my job, I am finally able to donate. Good luck to all the runners, this money goes towards the defeating Omega Weapon in FF8~
Et pourquoi pas Hercules pour Caith Sith à une prochaine run de FF7 ?
A shout out to the crowd who are having a great time even if it's the middle of the night for them!
...
WHEEEEEE Greetings from France!
just got back from in time to the end of the zelda relay. gonna stay up all night for final fantasy run.
$10 for the return of the floppy hat girl!!!
Il reste rien ! Bourrez Pif ! #Squidt
Looking forward to this FF8 run! Best of luck to the runners!
Getting hype for this Final Fantasy VIII run!
ffviii!! yea!!!
Stoked to donate for my favourite final fantasy game, and such a great charity. Good luck runners, and let’s see the omega weapon battle!!
The real Final Fantasy is the friends we made along the way
Last year I lost my dad to pancreatic cancer in a matter of two months. I've always watched AGDQ, but never donated. I don't want anyone to feel the pain I went through this summer. So, I want to donate during FF8, a game he got me for Christmas one year that easily became my favorite of the franchise.
Honey badger doesn't care, and neither should Squall!
Badger for Squall! ALL THE HONOR FOR THE WONDER RUNNER
It's always a pleasure seeing so many people fighting a common enemy of humanity while also having a great time and sharing their passion with the world. I hope in the future I can donate more but until then kindly accept these rupees I was able to spare.
Bonjour à tous, bon courage pour ce marathon, merci aux commentateurs/trice ! Des bisous ! #MarioLight
Blindfolded menuing in FF8? I need to see what this is all about!
whole ffviii run blindfolded or cowards /s
Here's to a fantastic event!
I lost both of my in-laws to cancer. We need to get rid of cancer once and for all! Thank you for such an amazing event and good luck to all the runners!
Just waiting to start work here in the UK, checking in, happy to see Final Fantasy 8 getting a run through. Shoutout to my Scrubtime Sundays crew and lets keep on raising money for a good cause!
Much love for FF8. Hoping the runners can show me how to finally get some hot dogs from the cafeteria.
Hello Guys! Great Event as every year! So happy to be able to catch some runs after work.I wish every Runner and everyone watching a great time! Keep the awesomeness up!
Final Fantasy VIII was my first game in the series growing up and has a special place in my heart. Can't wait to see a speed run of it live and good luck to the runners!
Laguna's theme = best theme
Shoutouts to Cordellium.
Thanks to everyone involved with AGDQ for this incredible event. I beat cancer a month ago and just got engaged over the holidays. Let’s all donate so that everyone can be as lucky as me!
Good luck to the boys running FF8 tonight! At work so I can't enjoy it live but I am excited!
I like Final Fantasy VIII and I like to see this lovely crew back at it: Tojju, the cute one – Muttski, the loveable prankster – and Luzbelheim, the strong, silent type. I will be here the whole night and loving every minute of the run. Question for the runners: Who is everybody’s favorite character in FFVIII?
Unity is strength when there is teamwork and collaboration, wonderful things can be achieved.
Shoutouts to GDQ & speedrunning for giving me some of the best friends I could ask for.
Don't have anything clever to say. Best of Luck to all the runners and have a great time for a great cause everyone
Bourré pif !
Road to Pif on y crois encore !
Greetings from Hungary! Thanks to everyone involved in the event, it always makes my January a lot better. Keep up the good work!
Trepies represent! Let's get a train going, make sure the best girl Laser Eyes the hell out of cancer AND Omega Weapon!
Amazing Zelda relay. Rock on! Put this one toward FF8 Omega Weapon.
i want to see omega weapon in the speed run
on va pas se laisser faire contre les ricains bourrez Pif les gens ! #ConseilDes4
couldn't let this game go by without a shoutout to my boyfriend GunslingerTuna. FF8 has a lot of special significance to us as a couple, and is a very important game to him, so seeing it remastered was exciting for us. it's even more exciting to get to see it run at GDQ as we love to watch the event together! donating $16 in honor of our upcoming 16th anniversary in March. good luck to the runners for a fantastic relay, and thanks to everyone making this wonderful event happen!
Greetings from Alaskan!We need to make that Animorphs run happen. I need that game in my life.
So hyped for the FF XVIII run
Already donated once this time around, but I just had to say: the late night dancers give me life. Keep having fun everyone, you make this event as great as it is.
Bon, je craque. Pif PASSERA !
Seen Luzbel do the blindfold menu last time during the FF9 run and there is nothing more to be said than he is an absolute machine. Good luck to the runners and looking forward to more memes, as is expected from these 3.
The memories. This is an awesome game indeed.
Hope this Final Fantasy run is Ex-Zell-erating! Ha. Ha. Ha.
HONK? HONK! HONK... HONK?!
FF! FF! FF! FF! FF!
Final Fantasy 8 hype! Locked in and ready for the long haul. Greetings from the front row.
Cancer is the Ancient Evil plaguing my family. I was introduced to AGDQ back in 2010, because while I am still trying to figure out how to fight Cancer with my own bare monk hands after all these years, GDQ is a constant, wonderful help. Also you (At time of donation) 19 nerds there on camera one of whom dancing? You all are the real MVPs. F*** Cancer.
Big ups to the front row but I've got to wonder what they were trying to summon in that T-Pose Circle...
Hello Everyone from Belgium ! Thank you to everyone working for the AGDQ. You rock !
Encore des gros bisous à tout le monde ! Bon marathon ! #DarkMage
audience front row, what is the pattern on your onesie?!
J'ai oublié de validé mon pif... Tant pis on recommence !
I dont get why everybody is talking about all night its 8:30 in the morning here. Lets get this going greetings from Austria
[FR] @PetitFlavius
Hi all !! Thanks for this great event and this good initiative you do every year. Together we will beat this curse. Good luck to every speedrunner!Bonjour le French restream. Merci pour la retransmission de cette événement. Tous ensemble on va vaincre cette maladie. J'en profite pour vous aider à bourrer Pif. On va l'avoir !!!!
Time for those late-night hours! Always love the final fantasy blocks at gdq, and for a first, I get to be here for it! Best of luck runners!
Here’s to Tojju, even if he shaved his mustache. Thanks for being a great Octodad and happy national English toffee day! #SaveTheMustache #SaveTheHotdogs

Guy in the red shirt in the front row, I love your moves <3
Slept all day and just drank 4 shots of espresso so I can stay up to watch my favourite game run by my favourite crew. Donation goes to naming Angelo “Muttski” because he’s a good boy.
Really excited to be here for these 3 awesome guys and this amazing game. Put this towards the blindfolded menu because it's guaranteed to be incredible.
France, mobilise-toi contre la menace Eiffel65 !#LonaLink
Here's to the strongest teacher I know: she loved the students that were the hardest to love, and was going through chemo at 4 in the morning before school so she wouldn't miss even one day with them. Had to donate during the first game I ever pulled an all nighter on, even though I only got to disc 3. Here's to crushing Omega Weapon!
The Legend of Zelda speedrun was awesome! This is my first time watching AGDQ and I’m loving the programming!
Finally able to donate to this great event, this is for my Aunt who just found out she is cancer free a few months ago! This FF8 speedrun is gonna kill my whole shift :)
My family carries a genetic predisposition to cancer, i lost my grandfather to it and my mothers had cancer twice. I tested positive for the gene last year, but with early detection and surveillance the risks are drastically decreased. Thank you so much for what youre doing here, and know that youre raising money for a fantastic cause <3
Time... It will not wait.
The outer part of a shadow is called the penumbra!(Winner's choice)
First time donator, glad to give to such a good cause, can we get a HYPE!!!
Lost my dad and my mother-in-law last year; it sucks, but at least I can support you all doing something good. Love you all for what you do
POUR LE PIF ! #Goupix
I should be sleeping... but how can I sleep when FFVIII is coming up???
Vriska may or may not have done some things wrong, but she deserves love anyway.
I’m 3 years cancer free and proud to donate to this wonderful cause. Looking forward to the run of one of my favorite games!
allez on lache rien, continuez de bourrez pour pif (mais surtout aussi contre le cancer) #IsaacLou
Fact : Omega's name in French version of final fantasy 8 is "minotaur". I'm still trying to undertand why. Good Luck for thé run guys and thanks everyone for this incredible event !
Donating for this amazing crowd. You make my mornings so much better! Thank you, you beautiful, dancing people. Love from Germany (honk)
So excited to watch tojju, muttski and Luz destroy FFVIII, donating for the epic blindfolded esthar menu. Most dificult in the entire FF franchaise? Best of luck you guys
Thank you all for this event and a huge shoutout to all restreams ! Have fun everyone !
Here’s to the crowd for keeping it real so late!
What’s up AGDQ, Keep it real yo
Vriska did several things wrong. Good luck and Godspeed, everyone! Appreciate all your hard work.
your dog comes to your rescue when you are in grave danger
Hi AGDQ! I have been watching AGDQ for many years now. I thank you for all you do, It's my favorite time of the year, keep it up and also...HYPE!!!I mean HONK!
I played FFVIII when it first came out in 1999 and it's been my favorite game ever since. It also has the friendliest fandom community I've ever been privileged to be a part of, so on that note, shoutouts to my FFVIII discord group and everyone in the fandom I've befriended over the years--you're all fantastic and have changed my life for the better. Great to see it featured in GDQ for the first time in many years. Here's to lasting friendships and cancer prevention. And don't forget to HONK!
I lost my mom January 23, 2019 to brain cancer. She was an avid gamer herself and it feels only right to donate to this amazing event. Some of her favorite games were Burger Time, Bubble Bobble, Zelda, and the Final Fantasy series. I hope that someday, we will finally beat cancer for good. Thank you to all the runners, the awesome staff, the supporters, the Prevent Cancer Foundation, and of course, Twitch Chat! You all are the best. Love you and miss you mom!
Pour le pif et pour la bonne cause #DVVol2
Final fantasy 8 is my favorite game. And i need to see that blindfold menuing! Gteets from Poland.
Been a fan of AGDQ for years, its always great entertainment to watch while working on cosplay. Good luck to the runners on FF8!
 (Comment rejected)
Final Fantasy 8 is my first and favorite game in the franchise. I want to stay up for the stream but have to sleepnfor work!Best of luck runners!
Shoutout to the maymay chat. Best of luck to the runners and Tom is bad at fantasy
My husband's a cancer survivor, and FFVIII is my favorite game, so for me, donating is a no brainer. Thanks, GDQ, for all that you do, and now here's a Final Fantasy fun fact for you: Angelo is a very good GIRL!
Of course the singing incentive got met first; this community clearly has priorities.
This is my 3rd year watching GDQ. This is my first time donating. I lost my dad to cancer in 2003 so I hope this donation reaches somebody who needs it. For those battling cancer or know somebody who is, STAY STRONG! FF8 was my favorite in the series and it reminds me of the old gaming days when my dad would try to be "hip" with us kids and try to play PlayStation or N64. His favorite game was Smash bros! Thanks GDQ and I hope everyone enjoys this run.
Greeting from Australia. Been loving the runs today everyone. Having some dinner and settling in for the long haul of my favourite PS1 Game. Let's take down Omega Weapon down.
Last night's Terraria speedrun with Badger was so wholesome, and was so full of positivity, that I'm donating another $5 for Squall's name! Let's beat cancer with good vibes and good donation drives!
FF8 was my favorite in the series for a very long time, and as UW-Madison alum I've gotta have a hand in pushing Badger to the top for Squall's name. Thanks for the all the hard work you guys do for charity GDQ!
So I heard keiz is doing a run of a game no one else has finished. Here take my money!
Make sure the enemy (aka cancer) doesn't take all the hot dogs!!! Good luck Tojju, Muttshi, and Luzbelheim.
Good luck to the runners for FF8! It's gonna be a long one.
Shoutout to Kratos dancing in the front row!
The front row is bringing me so much joy right now...had to donate and say #FrontRowHype!!!
I have to go to work, sadly This is my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time. Let's kill Omega Weapon!
Kick cancers ass.
Let's get some Omega Weapon hype goin.
Love everything you guys do keep up the good work!!
First row dancing hype! You are awesome!
Front Row: I'm home unable to sleep with depression and watching you dance around has brightened my mood. Thank you. 💜🖤💜
I'll severely disappointed if no one talks about Eiffel 65 tonight! HYPE!
A Final Fantasy 8 HaikuA bunch of studentsGo on a magical questBig boys, bigger swords
Vive LFR et vive les speedruns de 8h+. Bonne chance aux personnes qui commentent ! #DarkMage pour ce joli mage noir !
cute crowd, cute chat, cute staff, cute announcer. Stay CUTE!
Good morning from the UK, very excited for the FF8 run! One of my favourite final fantasy games, after 5! Smash it guys!
free Beavis
Final Fantasy 8 is one of the biggest influences of my life so I have to donate for this run. I have a Griever tattoo on my chest and my obsession was so much that my friends nicknamed me 'Lion' in high school. This has to go toward Omega Weapon. Really excited for this run, even if it means staying up til 3AM in Australia.
Yeah FF8! Yeah Front Row Dancers!
good morning from Denmark! Had to tune in today for the FF8 run, the game must have taken me 90 hours on my first play, can't wait to see it done in a tenth of that.It will be amazing if I manage to get any work done today. Let's see the Omega fight!
Long time viewer, first time donating, had to donate for the Final Fantasy block. My mom was diagnosed 15 years ago and thanks to programs like this she's still with us today. This goes to Omega weapon, easily my favorite boss in FF 8.
Left screen for work, right screen for FF VIII speedrun, I'm ready for a great day at work! Good luck to the runners!
FF8 was my introduction to 3D FF games and was very much a favorite growing up. Sadly can't stay up to watch this live, but can't wait to have it in the background at work this week!
So glad to be able to see 3 of my favorite people speed run one of my favorite games of all time. May you get Zell card on first try!#SaveTheHotdogsPs, Tojju, I heard a disgusting rumor that Squall dies at the end of disc 1. Can you confirm or deny?
The FFIX run from last year was one of my all time favorites, when I saw the boys were back running VIII tonight I realized I wouldn't be sleeping. Nine hour speed run let's GO.
Big thanks to all of the runners in that amazing relay race! GDQ has the most hype events anywhere!
I hope this little donation help the foundation! Please start with the ff8 and please i want the Kratos in first line say hello to fragnaticc twitch channel that is watching you...
The Final Fantasy runs are my favourite each year, and I especially love blindfolded menuing. Good luck to the runners, and thanks to everyone at PCF and GDQ for their hard work. Much love.
My Griever tattoo tells me that this is the best Final Fantasy. Take down omega weapon for me.
Finally at a place where I can afford to donate. I'm sure its just the first of many :D
Here’s to my mom still teaching after beating breast cancer. Love you. Keep doing what you love.
Hello there from a late working Producer from WayForward Technologies. Let's prevent Cancer and defeat Omega Weapon. This is my favorite Final Fantasy, and happy to donate for the BEST Final Fantasy, fight me!
FF8 has been my favorite of the series since the first time I played it. Here's to battling cancer and Omega Weapon!
Greetings from Australia. I hope you all have a fantastic run. FF8 is the only game in the Franchise I haven't played. This run will be my first-time experience of the game, so I hope its fun, and stay awake.
I stayed up longer than I should have when I have work in the morning to watch the start of one of my favorite games. I was so hyped when they put Eden into FFXIV. Good luck to Tojju, Muttski, and Luzbelheim! I'll have to watch the VOD later but I'm looking forward to plenty of good times and hopefully some very serious discussions on the marvel that is Eiffel 65. Let's get Omega Weapon and Blindfolded Menuing unlocked!
Long time watcher first time being able to donate. Had to donate during the FF8 run. I have fond memories playing through this with my older brother.
So hype to see Momski’s favorite runner, Tojju. Kev, remember the Irish Jig. Gonna be watching all night, so best of luck! You’re fam now. Cancer sucks. Eiko is the best. I’ll donate another $50 if YoBGS gets my name right.
Best run. Omega Weapon HONK!
Tojju. Muttski. Luzbelheim. Let me start by saying thank you.Y'all's FF9 run from last year was the first speedrun I ever watched, and it opened the proverbial can of worms on what is now one of my favorite viewing habits. I've even begun learning how to run a game myself. It all started with watching that FF9 run. This past year was difficult for me, as I contended with unemployment and health issues, so now that I'm back on my feet I'd like to make a donation toward kicking the crud out of Omega Weapon.So, thank you to you three, AGDQ, and all the runners of every game this week. Stay hype and stay hydrated.
Really been enjoying the stream and f cancer.
Log time viewer and donator to GDQ. So happy the eyes on me incentive was met, this is going to be an amazing run. Good luck runners!!
Drawing and casting the best RNG spells on our finest SeeD members, Tojju, Muttski, and Luzbelheim! Lets hope the run doesn't give you any Grief-ver! Also... #SaveTheHotdogs!
I didn't play much Final Fantasy growing up but if I see an incentive to add a difficult boss to the run you better believe I'll donate for it! Good luck, and don't fall asleep!
Final Fantasy is my all time favorite game series, and Final Fantasy VIII was the first in the series I bought with my allowance money growing up. So much love for the community and passion from the runners. My heart goes out to anyone who been affected by cancer. Our fantasy for ending cancer is anything but final! Let’s end the fight against cancer for good!
Sup Muttski and Daverino! Got my cup of coffee and some snacks, ready to stay up with you all!
Hey yall, thanks for being the background noise to my day this week. Wish I could stay up for the run of one of the best Final Fantasy games, but I decided to leave my mark by making sure Griever's true name is in fact, Mufasa. Thanks to the runners for all they do and let's Renzokuken cancer!
Staying up all night for FF8? Sounds like my childhood. This game was my first ever RPG and is my favorite game of all time. Let's kick the butts of Ulitmecia, the menu, Omega Weapon, and most importantly cancer. Can I get a "Whatever..." from the crowd?
Did you know that Blue (Da Ba Dee) is not the best song on the album Europop?
I’m guaranteed to pass out before the end of the run, but I’m sure you folks will have a blast. I already consider this game more than busted, and that’s why I love it, so seeing you junction your way to Squallhala is a treat. SeeD is another step toward eliminating cancer, there are no Squallternatives.I leave you with a question. Is this speedrun a form of time compression?
The first final fantasy you ever play always has a special place in your heart, even if it's not the most popular game. Good luck, and hopefully we can all stay awake!
I know I should be asleep, but I wanted to at least get a donation in during the Final Fantasy VIII run! Shout outs to my lovely owner who has been going through renal cancer and my mother who has gone through both breast and tongue cancer.
So excited to see my favourite Final Fantasy being run at AGDQ! Good luck to the runners and let's keep that goal and fight Omega Weapon! Booyaka!
Final Fantasy 8 definitely has the best FF soundtrack! Excited for this run! Good luck!
Final Fantasy hype with a couch full of FF royalty, you got this!
This has been my favourite Final Fantasy for years but I never quite understood what the graphic down the button during Squall's Limit Break is for. Maybe couch can explain it to me? #SaveTheHotdogs
I've lost a lot of family to cancer over the years and an uncle whom was just diagnosed end of last year so I'm happy to donate to this cause. I watch AGDQ and SGDQ every year with my friends and we always try to donate at each event as it has brought so many fond memories staying up to watch. Keep up the great work.
Wishing I could stay up and watch the run, but sadly this year I have work in the morning. Here's 25 bucks towards Omega Weapon, can't wait to see the replay.
Donating for FF8, the only game in the series I never gave the time it deserved the first time around. Hope to see it (and Omega Weapon) lovingly smashed - good luck to the team!
sup guys! GL on the run and I can't wait to hear muttski's beautiful voice singing Eyes on Me.
Here’s to not sleeping and quitting smoking. Eff cancer!
So ... Last year was 'Eiffel65' revival run ... what is the secret goal for this year FF run ?
Let's go boysssssss, the people don't know what they're missing out on with the blindfolded menu so let's make it happen. I hope that Muttski's moves are not weak today. #SaveTheHotdogs
This is the best looking game here. Good luck tonight and I'll be watching. :)
Can you not break Google Analytics this time?Also, is there a FFVIII equivalent of a bird where you throw 4 tents at it and NOT blind and silence the boss?
I had to donate during Final Fantasy VIII as it's my favorite game ever. Good luck to the runners staying up all night to make this run happen!
swish swish bang bang
I love FF8 and since we already have Eyes On You, splitting my donation towards the blind menuing and Omega Weapon, hoping to extract maximum value from this run. Best of luck runners and warm up those voices!
Here's 888 dollars for an 8-hour run of Final Fantasy 8 on January 8th. How many 8s can we get in the donations during this run?Donation goes to slaying Om8ga Weapon. ;)
Congratulations GDQ on 10 years, I have been watching since 2013 and every year gets better and better. I am so excited for this FF8 run as it is not only my favorite Final Fantasy, but one of my favorite games of all time. Glad to see it at a GDQ, best of luck to the runners and let's see that Omega Weapon fight. I am hoping to stay awake for the whole run. Thanks to everyone making this event so wonderful.
Excited to see the Final Fantasy runners coming in strong, love watching these longer games get taken down. Now the most important question Muttski is badger an un-ironic eiffel 65 fan or is that saved only for FF9? Also congrats on the job in your field toju
Last years FFIX run got me into speed running, so I'm super happy to be giving my first donation to these guys! Can't wait for this years Eiffel 65 discussions. HONK
Bourrez les pifs euh non Bourrez Pif et bourrez les dons ! Mais surtout gardez la pêche ! #LonaLink
Question for the runners: what's your favourite Effiel 65 song?
Been waiting on this FF8 run all day! Lets get a 10 dollar eiffel 65 10 dollar donation train going. Good luck on the run guys. HYPE!!!!
OMEGAAAA
hey fam, cheering you on front the front.

(Lyrics are provided!)I want to ride my chocobo all dayI wanna see them runI wanna ride and play! hey!I want to ride my chocobo all dayI wanna join the fun50 gil I’ll gladly pay! Yay!
Badger badger badger badgerMush-room Mush-room
Glad to see Luz, Muttski, and Tojju back at it again at GDQ! Love the Final Fantasy runs! Shout outs to all the runners, hosts, staff, and everyone who helps put on such a great event! Special thanks to Nicholas who spent the last 10 months helping get a lost package from last AGDQ delivered to me :)
...
Thanks to all the behind the scenes folk who make agdq run "smoothly"
My butt hurts from all this sitting... Remember to stretch it out during these long hours.
Greetings from Costa Rica! Just wanted to wish a great 2020 to everyone currently in and watching AGDQ!!
Fun fact about Fujin and Raijin. They were initially designed for Final Fantasy 7, where they would be mercenaries that pursued Avalaunche. This role was eventually merged with the Turks and they were scrapped only to be brought back for FF8. Raijin's trademark 'ya know' is actually a translation of a fairly well know Yakuza saying, which give his lines a lot more menace in the original Japanese, whereas Fujin's remarks are a bit of a mis-translation. Originally, she speaks in Kanji characters as opposed to full sentaces, which is meant to imply that she is being curt and to the point, but the all caps gives her an impression of yelling which is not correct. When the character was reused in Kingdom Hearts, they changed her text box style to reflect this. Keep on doing what you're doing, and be nice to eyepatched people, we're always amazing :)
Wish I could donate more, but take my 5! Best of luck to all the runners and thank you to all the wonderful people behind the scenes. Also, obligatory HONK!
First time I can afford to donate so I do ! Let's go for my favorite FF.Good luck for the runners and the casters !<3 in the chat for this great cause. Sharing love is dividing pain
[FR] Allez on bourre, les sacs #TempeteDeSang
At last ffviii, so much hype!
FFVIII was my first game in the franchise too! I must have spent at least 300 hours on it (or was it 400?whatever). So, to see it done in less than 10 hours? Jayzus... Good luck!
How am I still awake?
Yo what up! I never knew the protagonist's real name was Squall, always knew them as Leon through the Kingdom Hearts games.
Oh my. FF8. Bye, bye to my work productivity today! Have a good run chaps!
Had to donate during Final Fantasy as it got me through some tough times, especially losing my grandma/guardian to cancer years ago. Thanks for everything you do at games done quick. Oh and for the couch, nice Blink shirt dude!
Glad to be able to finally attend a GDQ event finally. Thank you for bringing the show south and uniting us to kick cancer's butt!
First donation ever made ! Thanks for all fellow speedrunners. I've been following the GDQs for years and I won't stop !Pif I choose you !Pardon my french, bisous au FrenchRestream, hommage à vos jeux de mots qualitatifs qui éclairent mes nuits/matinées (je sais plus) #MarioLight
I had to donate during the FF8 run. This game and the entire Final Fantasy series have given me some of my best memories gaming. I can't wait to see it done quick!
Good luck to Muttski’s mom’s favourite speedrunners and, of course, Muttski himself #SaveTheHotdogs #SaveTheWalruses
Hi there! First time donator, FFVIII was the very first Final Fantasy game I ever played, it had a huge impact on me growing up, had to stay up to see this run! Hoping to see that Omega fight! Ps., Seifer Almasy did nothing wrong!
Was talking about streaming a playthrough of a friend of FFVIII and thought what better cause to spend my money on than this! Good luck on the run and best of vibes to the AGDQ community!!! go 2020!
Glad to see Final Fantasy back at AGDQ. FFIX was one of my favourite runs last year. Hopefully we'll be learning some great new facts about Eiffel 65 this year.
Its FINALly time for my favorite run of the marathon! Good Luck to Tojju Luz And Muttski.
We got this.
You have a moustache this year.
Sadly due to the bushfire ravaging my beautiful country, most of my budgeted donation money has already been spent, but I always make sure to keep a bit aside for GDQ. Hope everyone has a great day and enjoy the runs!
Watching Final Fantasy VIII while playing XIV with a character dressed like a character from X. Getting a full dose of my favorite game series tonight. Good luck on the run!
$10 for each of the great guys who got me into Final Fantasy IX, Can't wait to be awed again this year, let's crush that blind folded incentive.
FFVIII is THE game that looms largest in my gaming memory, so I am very hyped for the run. Let's get a DOOM--I mean, donation train going so we can unlock Blindfolded Menuing. Booyaka!
Hope the final fantasy run goes smoothly even tough it is a long run :)
Sorry I'm stuck in Jersey, babe. Thanks for taking care of the cat. Love you.
I guess being Choco, I kind of HAVE to donate now. Good luck on the run. Donation goes to announcer's choice.
Always excited to see Final Fantasy runs at GDQ. Hoping this one will be as entertaining as the FFIX run last year. Really got a kick out of the huge Eiffel 65 Google search spike. Donation goes toward blindfolded menuing because it's consistently mind-blowing.
Me and my wife watch everytime these Final Fantasy speedruns! FF games are huge part of our lives and it is amazing to see people play these amazing games for a good cause! All eyes on Luzbelheim when he goes on god mode and does blindfolded menuing! Tnaks you everyone in AGDQ for your hard work! Lots of love from Finland.
Ah Final Fantasy VIII... A game with an absolutely fantastic first half and a crazy mess of a second half. Despite the game kinda losing it's way around the midway point, I absolutely love it, and it's great to finally see it played at GDQ. Let's see that Omega Weapon fight!
Cancer got the best of my Uncle last June.This donation might be too late for him but I hope it will help other.A big thanks to everyone involved in the event. #GDQup
Having never played the FF franchise, I have absolutely 0 idea on what is happening.Luckily I am turbo baked and just have to keep my hands inside this particular ride.Give yourselves a round of applause while I roast this bowl!
Good luck to my boys on this great FF8 run. I wanna know what everyone's favorite song from this game is! I'm partial to Blue Fields or Succession of Witches. Keep up the good work for this fantastic cause. #SaveTheHotdogs
Hyped for the FF8 Run, love the FF Speedruns, FF 8 is the fourth best FF and I love Final Fantasy. A Question, what is your opinion about the FF8 Remaster?Donation to Davesterios choice.
I think I remember playing FF8, but all I remember it as is a card game. Excited for this run, and for fighting Omega Weapon!
I love Final Fantasy VIII, and I love seeing it broken wide open! Donating to make sure Omega Weapon gets destroyed!
Come on, everybody! Make momski happy, and make her favorite speedrunner do the Esthar menu blindfolded!
Woke up just in time to catch the start of this FFVIII run. Been years since I've played this and always had a love for 8, so will be amazing to check out again.Good luck to the runners today, And may everyone stay awake throughout it! 10 towards the blindfolded menuing and 15 towards defeating Omega weapon.
Donating during Final Fantasy VIII in honor of my friends' upcoming wedding. Congratulations Micah and Maddie! Remember to answer with "I do" and not "Whatever."And because love is blind, put this toward some blindfolded menuing.
Staying up at the dead of night for this bahamut of a run! My brain says, "What about sleep?" but my heart says, "...Whatever."
Hello from the couch behind d the couch
Sadly i cant watch it live, because i am at work, but i hope i hear my donation afterwards in the video upload.Greetings to the couch, youre doing an amazing job and to the staff. Donation goes to naming Griever the best Name. Mufasa :)
Triple Triad objectively better than Blitzball
I love ff8, Heres to everyone staying up and supporting for a great cause! Hype!!!
This was always my favorite Final Fantasy game as a kid, and I'm excited to see it being played here! Good luck to the runner!
FFVIII has been one of my favorite games for decades, and I can't wait to see these guys tear it apart! The Omega fight is really cool, and Luzbelheim's menuing is insane! Can we get a train going for these incentives?
Thanks AGDQ for running one of my favorite Final Fantasy games. This is nostalgic to watch since game I spent many late night hours in college playing it. Thanks to early screening two of my family members were able to detect and treat breast cancer early on and I'm happy to say are cancer-free, happy and healthy to this day. Put part of this donation towards the Omega Weapon incentive. Good luck and let's beat both Omega Weapon and Cancer
zfg is my favorite runner, thank you for being nice :)
Hey Mutt, Tojju, and Luz! You're the best looking pixelated faces in the room! Best of luck for the whole run and #SaveTheHotdogs!
Long time watcher, 2nd time donator. I disagree about triple triad being the best minigame. Tetra Master in FF9 I think was much better. Will play against you to prove I'm right. Donation goes to Animorphs because I need to see that dumpster fire in play. Please and thank you.
Nothing like playing FF all night while watching FF all night. Let's kill omega!
For my pops and FFVIII. Much love to all GDQ
Love seeing this awesome panel break FF8 wide open! Would love to hear if any of the Tojju or any of the couch subscribe to the "Squall is Dead" theory....
I'm so happy to see my favorite Final Fantasy game live! FF8 was one of the first games I ever beat in my life (with help from parents since I was really young). I watch the RPG Limit Break entry occasionally, and while I don't have a lot to give, I have to do my best for one of my favorite games and one of the neatest speedruns!
Tojju Luz and Muttski are Really good at this game.. Yu na? Sorry Ei Full bad about that one.

Saw the Final fantasy 9 run from last year on youtube and fell in love with these speedruns, Love all of you at GDQ and good luck to the runners, lets get that blind menuing HYPE!
Fight Omega Weapon!
Blind Fold Hype!
As promised, here is the other $10 I said I'd donate. I added an extra $5 because my last donation was read! Sadly I haven't been able to watch the Zelda or Final Fantasy runs due to work. Can't wait to watch the VODs and the rest of this amazing week.
All I have to say during the FF8 run is. Water and Water and Water Water.
So psyched for another run from the 3 champions tojju, mutt, and luz the silent. Loved the last one, of course this donation goes to the epic blind menuing. One question for the runners and couch, what are your opinions on eiffel 65?
First time being able to donate to a GDQ, and felt right during an FF run. Absolutely love these games and happy to see them become a marathon staple. Keep up the informative commentary, and best of luck to the runners.
Look, I know it's gonna be tough but I really hope we can beat Vriska last minute. New decade! Pull through guys, let's name Rinoa "Minshew" instead.
Ive been watching GDQ for years, I was so excited last year when I heard that AGDQ would be close to me in Florida. I immediately made plans to go. But ironically, 4 months ago I was diagnosed with Leukemia, preventing me from going. Its been a tough battle so far however this disease will NOT be my final boss fight. All these great runs are keeping my spirits up right now and I want to do what I can to support GDQ/PCF so they can help others fight. Good luck to the FF8 runners, and dont forget to orb!..... oops I meant HONK!
Shoutout to my favorite runners playing my favorite Final Fantasy game. Good luck to all of you. This is an all GF run right? I heard that Eden is pretty good to use for this right? #SaveTheHotdogs
Pops is staying up late to catch all of FF VIII this year. Looking forward to this cast and this couch like you wouldn't believe - shout outs to you all from the great frozen north where it was nearly -40 today. Stay warm, save frames, and gunblade cancer. (But don't let Muttski trigger that gunblade, apparently). Donation to see Luz crush that menu.
FF8 will always be my favorite game. Whatever...
Luzbelheim blindfold? I have to see this amazing feat once more. Thank you everyone for all the work that's done to support an amazing. cause.
First off, will there be another recorder solo like the run from RPG limitbreak? Also who is the one of you guys that does not like poutine?
Q: What does Squall use when he has chapped lips?A: Lip BalambGood luck to all thee runners! FF8 HYYYPE!!!
Final Fantasy VIII was the first FF I played when I was nine. It is amazing that it is still being played today, and for such a wonderful cause! Keep up the awesome work guys and GDQ. Looking forward to the blindfold menu and Omega Weapon. Greetings from Mexico.
*sung in the ff8 battle theme* Water and water and water water, Water and water and water water, Water and water and water water, Water and water and water water, Water and water and water water,Water and water and water water, Water and water and water water, Water and water and water water
Donating to one of my first and favorite RPG's. Final Fantasy 8 left an impact on me growing up, and will always have a special place in my heart. I am ecstatic to see it at GDQ (especially during a rough patch in my life) and supporting such a great cause!
I love watching my favorite speedrunners Tojju, Muttski, and Luzbelheim. Here's to the incredible blindfolded menuing.
Need to see that Blindfolded menu from Luzbelheim since the FFIX Blindfold menu was insanely skillful and super cool. It's 9pm here in New Zealand right now and I have work at 5am, looks like i'm doing and all nighter to catch the Esthar menu live. Good luck to Tojju, Muttski and Luzbelheim on the run. Also Hey J2 and Dave
FF8 is amazing, and I'm so sad I'm going to miss the run. I love seeing the mix of exploits and strategy that makes FF games speedrun-able. Thanks for all you do!
FF8 best FF, gotta get Zell his hotdogs.
I think I see some familiar faces from last year's Final Fantasy relay. Is it too early in the night to start talking about Eiffel 65? Good luck, dudes!
Thanks for this amazing Event and this amazing Game was really looking forward to the Final Fantasy VIII run. My Mother fought off cancer last year thanks to early detection so I appreciate this event even more than before.So here is my money for the Omega Weapon fight.
Whatever.
HeyGuys, it's Chuck. Some say all you need for the best final party is Irvine, but I think it requires a Canadian, an American, and a Spaniard. Wishing you guys good luck on your run. #savethehotdogs P.S. I hope Luz practiced Esthar because it doesn't take me long to whip up an FF8 list of shame...
Thanks for running my favorite RPGs! I've watched you guys forever!
Kill the Cancer, save the Hot Dogs!
I hope this helps somewhat. Eden is by far my favorite GF of all time. Wish we had ozma fight. But put this towards omega fight.
So happy getting to be here for a final fantasy run. Incentive goes to Omega weapon and shoutout to my niece Hayden watching back home.
It took me 99 hours and 59 minutes to beat this game as a kid... Crazy to see it done in a tenth of that time! Putting this towards the Blindfolded Menuing since I have to see it to believe it! This all goes to an amazing cause so keep doing what y'all do best!
Gogo French Restream !!
Badger might say "Whatever," but I'm all in for this. Time to Renzokuken cancer.
Question for runners/couch. Who is your favorite character in FFVIII, playable or not?
So do we all agree Shiva is the best GF since she is Blue like Eiffel 65? Donation towards Omega Weapon!
A more formal donation this time. I really appreciate everything you are all doing. GDQ gets bigger and better every year, and while I haven't lost anyone to cancer, my friends have. It's such an important disease for us to defeat. No one should suffer from this anymore. Best of luck to the speedrunners, and thanks to everyone involved. On a less formal note, Hopefully we can beat out Vriska last minute. It would mean a lot for the decade going forward. Don't let this be a stain in GDQ History!
Whatever.
Oh captain, my captain! How could I ever NOT see the similarity? Thanks for pointing out this obvious fact about Cid. Good luck on the run! Also on defeating Omega, which this money goes towards.
Inspired by that Animorphs donator from before so I gotta give to that, i mean everyone live animorphs right??? Have an amazing final fantasy viii run! Also, shout out to that amazing AUDIENCE! HOOOOONNNKKK. LET'S KICK CANCER IN THE BUTT!
Thanks to all for making this possible. Keep it up.
Was sitting here listening to my favorite album, europop, and the FF8 run started. FINAL ly i can experience my two favorite things together.
Had to donate during my favorite game series. Can't wait to see this game beat sub 9 hours!Good luck to all the runners!
Hello Tojju and friends! Greetings from the side of the stream room. Had to donate during FF8, my gateway to RPGs, for which I might not have met some of the awesome people here had I not played. Lost my uncle to pancreatic cancer last year so this event means just a bit more to me this time.Now I know Eyes on Me is met, but how much to get the couch to sing to "Fithos Lusec Wecos Virosec" in Deling City? :)
I have been watching All the DGQ over the past 4 years and is always some of the best weeks for the year, so i had to donate doing my favorite game series of all time, since most of the final fantasy games got me through my grandmothers death from cancer. hope you all have a great event and good luck to all the runners. greetings from Denmark

Here's another $15 toward the blind menuing incentive; I just have to see it! Looking forward to seeing this entire run and hoping to hear some more serious Eiffel 65 discussion.
Greetings from France,I could not miss to donate during this run which guided my childhood. First I played of the franchise and I fell in love with it. The music and the cut-scenes blew my mind at the time. It lives all the way up there in my hall of fame along with games such as golden sun.Here's to defeat Omega and get the blind menuing. Keep up the good work
It's a shame you can't rename Seifer 'Goose.' "It's a beautiful day in Balamb Garden and you are a Horrible Student."(HONK!)
(Please read when Selphie gets introduced)muttHype (pause) muttHype muttHype (pause) muttHype muttHype muttHype (pause) muttHype muttHype (pause) muttHype
Always love seeing you guys run FF games at marathons. Here's hoping to see that 10-man FFX relay for SGDQ.
Long time watcher, first time donater. Watching GDQ has always been the highlight of January and June. Looking forward to this year's finale and good luck to all the runners in the marathon!
I am watching this run during an overnight shift at work. FF8 was the first Final Fantasy I ever beat. I am excited to watch the boys crush this game! Let's get that blindfolded menuing!P.S. I hope Muttskis moves aren't weak.
Always look forward to each Final Fantasy run at GDQ, the comfiest run every time. Just gutted I have to work through this year's.Just remember, Eiko sucks.
Hello everyone, it's me again !Final Fantasy (VII / VIII / IX ) were my first games and the ones who makes me love videogames ! It's a part of videogame history so, thanks a lot for share this passion with all of us and keep going the donations, i'm so proud of you all <3
You know why they call it speedrunning? Because you run away from all the enemies :)
Good luck with the run, Tojju!
Last year I had to catch the VOD of the Final Fantasy IX run because I did not have the strength to stay up late enough to finish it. Now that I have moved to Japan and just got done with work that won't be a problem! Last AGDQ, the blindfolded menuing was the absolute highlight of the event so this goes toward seeing it done again in FF8. Thank you runners and thank you AGDQ from Kobe, Japan!
You're welcome Muttski. Greetings from row 3.

Good luck on the run, mates. Awesome to see Tojju, Muttski, and Luzbel doing a quick game again, along with the incomparable voice and wisdom of J2 and Dave! But more important than that, let's see that Blindfold Menu! #SaveTheHotdogs
Been watching GDQ for years but it's my first time donating. Had to do it for the runners, couch, and game - the commentary and the way jokes are being thrown in are great so far. Also gotta see that Omega Weapon fight!
They say being sick at home is never fun. With a final fantasy VIII run, im doubting that. Greetings from the Netherlands
First time donating. This is for Matt who is in the process of spawning a paracite. Good luck Runners!
GDQ brings out the best in the gaming community. Fills me with all kinds of good feels!
Best of luck with the run from the UK! It's so brilliant to see Final Fantasy VIII run at GDQ by three talented runners. Thanks to all of the staff and volunteers who make this event happen. Let's send cancer into time compression!
Caught last year's FF9 run on VOD, now catching FF8 live! Thanks for hosting this run.
You know, I have one simple request. And that is to have satellite dishes with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads!
Good luck to Tojju, Luzbelheim and Muttski! muttHype muttLove
Poor wedge isn't getting any pay this month it's ok I'll spot him for a gdq donation hopefully he gets pay next month
After being shown GDQ by my roommate, have always enjoyed watching the final fantasy runs; now I can finally catch one live! At least as long as I stay awake for anyway... Best of luck to the runners and may the RNG treat you well. And thanks to everyone for putting on such an awesome event for a great cause!
My favorite game done by my favorite runners. Shout out to Dave with the FFVII level 99 run. Good luck guys.
Tojju? Are you coming back for me? This crab/spider monster is really scary.
thank you for running my favorite game
Thanks to Mr MV and the French restream. Love to all
I’m loving the banter. Good luck on the run, all! #KoolaidmanBoat
Yay a FF run. What obscure 80's, 90's or early 2000's one hit wonder band are we going to talk about this GDQ? My vote is Aaron Carter.
FF8 is one of my favourite games of all times. spent hours playing it, when i was much younger then now.enjoy every minute of it.let´s do always our best.
 (Comment rejected)
I flew all the way out here to watch the FF8 run just find out you hate puppies, I'm so disappointed.
This one's for Muttski, the best looking guy here... Who can't dance.
Greetings from the front row. Question: why is FF6 objectivity better than FF8? In all seriousness, what is everyone's favourite FF?
Muttski's mom here staying up late to watch my favorite runners. Can't wait to hear the song later. Good luck guys!
Sad that I missed the Adventures of Lolo run yesterday but hope that I did ok.Have just gotten in to the office and am so happy to have this awesome FFVIII run with the godlyk play by play commentary to listen to all day as I work!Keep up the amazing work guys. Lots of love from Lolo in London xxx
gl tojju and muttski on this amazing run. and gl Luzbel with the sure to come blindfolded menu. thx for showing this amazing run!PD: too bad rinoa can't be called after the greatest FF character of all time... Eiko
Final Fantasy 7 was my intro to the series, and I somehow got it into my head that FF 8 would be a continuation, so when I played the game, I was trying to figure out how the two went together. I guess it's lucky for me there's Kingdom Hearts for that? At any rate, good luck on the run and let's get Omega fight and Blindfolded menuing met!
Thank you so much for doing such a wonderful thing, FFVIII is The game of my childhood. Anti-cancer HYPE
Greetings from the UK! Final fantasy speed runs have kept me company throughout several sleepless nights. I was hoping to catch this one live, but I have a hot date and will have to keep checking in on toilet breaks! Good luck to the runners, this goes towards busting Omega, who caused me no end of hassle in ‘99!
Keep it going, everyone Appreciate everything that's being done today.
Go go go ! On lâche rien ! et on met tout sur PIF ! #zhtDoom
Psyched to watch my favourite game run by these great streamers! FF8 fans are all my friends! Remember, when Time Compression starts, As friends, don't forget one another! As friends,believe in one another! Believe in your friends' existence! And they'll also believe in yours. To be friends, to like one another, and to love one another... You can't do these things alone. You need somebody. Right, guys?
A small token of appreciation for Tojju's amazing effort and calmness under pressure during that Zell card manipulation — one of the hardest in the series for sure! Keep going, defeat Omega Weapon, and save the hotdogs!
Don't want to be over-ZELL-ous, but I wanted to bring out a Final Fantasy joke a lil early!Why are there no flowers in Trabia Garden?Because they lost all their SeeDs!
Always love being able to sit back and relax with some AGDQ after a long exhausting day <3 and truly appreciate the charity! Keep up the awesome work everyone ^.^
Nice run, good luck and greetings from Germany!
I do not care what they say, FF8 is definitely the best of the FF's's. I hope you guys have a good run. Thank you!
Hey everyone! Rory here. I just wanted to wish all three of the runners good luck, we're all counting on you. Thank you guys for once again representing the Final Fantasy Speedrunning community with an amazing run. You guys do a lot for our community with every marathon you guys run in, and I hope that the next 10 years of GDQ are just as full of amazing runs from our community as the last 10¬ Donation will go towards THEEEE Muttski's choice. Also #SaveTheHotdogs
good dog
These long late night FF runs are some of my favourite parts of GDQ. Good luck on the run guys, really going to miss Cords Recorder solo and singing though.
Hey guys! Keeano here! Good luck to my Final Fantasy Speedrun brethren muttski, tojju and luz! Shoutouts to all the members of the FF speedrun community! Donation goes to the blindfolded menu because, Why would you not want to see Luz the god, be a god?
Hey Tojju, Muttski, and Luzbel! Good luck tonight with the run! I hope we get to see that insane Blindfolded menuing incentive. Also Muttski, when are you running Dirge of Cerberus? muttSass Much love!
I've been watching AGDQ for many years but this is the first year I've been able to donate. Thank you everyone for all the effort you put into making such an awesome event for such an awesome cause even more awesome each and every year!
Thanks to the runners and staff for all you do! Here's to stopping cancer!
Whatever.
Blindfolded menuing? Whatever.
Whatever
Best run on my birthday? That means I must donate. I loved watching my brother play FFVIII when I was a kid. Didn't understand the game back then. Still don't get it now but it sure goes a lot faster now. Can I get a: "gefeliciteerd met je verjaardag" from the announcer? (happy birthday in dutch)
My wife and I had our first dance to Eyes on Me. Cheers to the runners of this beautiful game and the organization that has been the champion of social good for so many years. Love you all!
What an awesome prequel/sequel to last years run! Love the preparation that goes into running these longer games. Let's finish off those incentives!
As a person who has only played FF9, it’s awesome to finally see this game played live. Love the commentary. Good luck runners and thank you for the awesome show for an amazing cause! Also I think the dancers in the crowd should give Squall some dance lessons! Much love to everyone!
One day I'll tell you about my ROMANTIC DREAM!
Cheers one of the best and underrated final fantasy games!
S rank commentary from the couch. Let's beat Omega Weapon!
"...""Whatever."
Donating to a great cause, during a speedrun of one of my favourite games, played by the people who got me into speedrunning. Good luck on the run guys, can't wait for the "Eyes on Me" performance!
UwU
Couldn't find the hot dog incentive but I'll settle for Griever being named "Hotdog" in honor of all the hot dogs that fought that day.
Hey dudes. I give this run two thumbs up.
Here's my contribution to the blindfolded menuing! Good luck bois!
Not long after we started dating, my wife and I went to school dressed as Squall and Rinoa for Halloween. We exchanged Squall and Rinoa figures for birthday presents, and they would later top our wedding cake. It's hard to believe that in just a few weeks, we celebrate 20 years together. Her best friend has been battling cancer for nearly as long, so here's my small contribution to a great cause. Happy anniversary, my sorceress. I've always had my eyes on you.
Had to donate during the FF8 run, i never made it through CD 4 back in the days, so i´m happy to finally find out, how this game ends!
FF8 was the first Final Fantasy game I ever finished, and it's also the game that introduced me to GDQ and speedrunning three years ago. Big thanks to the runners, staff, and community for being so awesome and saving the world at the same time.
Squall? Having trouble communicating? Whatever
Where’d all the hotdogs go?
Yooooo! You Guys Are Simply The Best. Better Than All The Rest. Better Than Everyone. Better Than Anyone That's Ever Completed-A-Game-In-Not-Very-Long!! Good Luck Have Fun!!
Thanks GDQ for all you do. Lost a friend last month to cancer so here's hoping this helps prevent someone else from feeling that pain. Super hyped for the rest of this FF8 run!
So, it's like 1am, I'm super tired and I'm listening/sorta watching this run. Wish I had something wittier to say. Zell instead of Squalling, better take a Selphie.Donation to Whatever's choice.
Great couch, great run so far. I knew I shouldn’t have turned this on when I have to work in the morning. Looking forward to my boss asking me why I’m so tired at work later and giving the classic “whatever.”
Been looking forward to this run all week. 3 excellent runners that have given me many the distraction to take my mind off of alot of negative things over the last year.My granddad was diagnosed with prostate cancer late last year, and thanks to the work that all of the various charities do, he is on the up and up.Good luck with the run, love you all, #SaveTheHotdogs
Had to donate during the FF8 speedrun. This donation is for my one of my best friend's Jim. Who lost his Grandmother on New Year's Day this year when she lost her fight against cancer. Jim loves to tease me about the fact that Squall was the first guy I ever had a crush on. So this one is for you Jim, and most importantly this one is for Mausie.
Whatever.
Loved FF8 when I was a kid but could never get past the spaceship. I finally beat the game for the 1st time last week! Lets get that omega weapon fight!
Sneaking in a donation during my lunch break. Ff8 is a huge part of my childhood. The music is always relaxing and I even discovered the water junction strat on my own back then. So listening it at work has been keeping my stress down. I want to see a omega weapon fight when I make it home so my money is going to that

It's great to see that the game being speedrun right now is the first Final Fantasy game I've ever played, learning about the series from a Pizza Hut demo disc of all things. This event's amazing for everything its done in the past years, but the run itself right now, it's... you know... whatever.

Muttski is a skilled player but that is not normal, This Is very very insane....They need to check his ps2 and game.....Maybe he’s not cheating but maybe he’s using the game deficit ...and this cant be seen on the game screen..He needs to check-up...Maybe everyone doesn’t know his trick. He is incredible....I want to ask him: does Eiko suck?Love you, buddy. Hashtag Game Deficit
My first Final Fantasy and I still didn't see any speedrun of it ?! Time to correct that mistake and see how that game can be broken.
I finally get to see my Favourite Final Fantasy at GDQ. Easily has the best music of any Final Fantasy. Good luck to the runners and donation goes to Omega weapon fight
Donating for the first RPG I ever played as a child. Thank you for bringing back such wonderful memories.

Hey guys, good luck on the run! Loving the fun energy here and looking forward to going to work without sleep, because who could miss this?! Choo choo Selphie train hype! #SaveTheHotdogs
One of my favorite parts of this game is when Zell almost derails a train and kills everyone with a single punch.
Always happy to support a good causeKeep up the great work
Had to wake up super early to catch one of my favourite Final Fantasy games, and what better time for a donation! I spent so much time playing this game growing up, how did I not notice Zell's walking on toothpicks??? Never skip leg day, kids! Donation goes to host's choice.
J'ai perdu deux membres de ma famille d'un cancer foudroyant en moins de 6 mois cette année. J'espère juste que ça n'arrive à personne d'autre, le cancer est un fléau

Once we have beaten cancer we should research a cure for anxiety-triggered leg cramps!
I've just gotten to Lunatic Pandora on my first run that I actually feel like I understand the junctions and know how I want to build my party, and now watching you, I want to start all over to experience it again.
Donating for the best team playing the game and on the couch. Watch that leg cramp.
I never realized people still play FFVIII. I love this game so much I'm so happy to see people talk about it so fondly. It's awesome that you are all playing it for such an awesome cause as well.Oh and "Whatever"
Tojju kinda sound and gesture like Quentin Tarantino. I bet he'd make an awesome Tarantino impersonation!This donation goes towards Eiffl65 Angelo

I love this game being beat so quick, I spent so many days of summer trying to beat this game. You guys are awesome, beat cancer, and always, save those frames. Donation to runner choice.
Greetings from Aersia! Thanks for a comfy and informative run! Loving the story explanations despite all the text being skipped.
"Lemme take a Selphie !""Whatever."Always love the FF runs at the GDQ. I sure hope the runner won't have a cramped hand ! Good luck with the RNG battles.
So happy to see AGDQ still going strong after so many years. I've loved watching it every year and seeing it grow. As someone who has had two family members survive cancer, I'd love for successful stories to continue to outnumber the sad ones. Save the frames and kill cancer
Daba di da whatever.
Heck yeah, the adventures of Squawk and Quinoa

Merci à vous pour cet event. Toujours un plaisir de vous suivre !
Good luck to the runners! Please don’t 720 Angelo like the other dog. hollowFace

Night Shift worker here donating a few extra here in honor of one of the most underrated RPGs ever. I actually proposed "my dude" for Rinoa earlier, but, whatever. Maybe next year! Thanks to the runners and crew for keeping my night entertained! Let's meet those extra incentives so let's get another donation train going! I challenge everyone here to push up to $600K by the end of the run!
Thanks to GDQ and the runners to make this 9 hour gem of a run happen. This game is so well made and left a strong imprint on me in many ways. Oh, the memories.Let's get all the incentives met for this, and keep donating for the rest of the week for a great event and a good cause.
Awesome people playing awesome games for an awesome cause. But you know. Whatever.
Honk honk, runners! I really appreciate you running this game. This was my first FF-game, and thanks to your community, this was the first game I speed-ran too!I only had access to the Japanese version though, and I realised too late that it didn't have access to junction exchange...But you know ... Whatever

Hey! Remember a few years ago? During your Co-op run of FF9, When we all talked about how we un-ironically liked Eifel 65, lets bring that back! MY favorite song from Europop was "Living in a bubble"also this donation goes to omega weapon...Love you all, keep the good vibes going!
Hey Everyone!Thank you all for this great event supporting a great cause, keep up the good work! I'm really glad that one of my favorite Final Fantasy games made it to GDQ, good luck to the runners, you guys are great. Donation goes towards Omega Weapon for the sake of even more Final Fantasy :)

If I said this run wasnt entertaining then "maybe I'd be lying"... sorry, keep up the awesome work!
if this sentence scares you as much as i did when i was younger, please donate! "The random rule has spread to all regions" Amazing work by all the runners, support and announcers so far!
Thanks for speed running one of my all time favorite Final Fantasy titles. uWu
Hello GDQ !I've been watching for few years and I love what you do !Luzbelheim, don't break the OKAY counter please.
A run of FFVIII? Whatever. It's not the best, but it's not the wortst either. It could be better with a fight against the Omega Weapon.On a more serious note, thanks GDQ for what you do, thanks everyone who donate, thanks runners for the week of entertainment (and the few more with the VoDs).
#SaveTheHotdogs good luck on the run guys! Happy to see my favorite game being run by such great people! don’t miss out on the blindfolded esthar menu. Donate donate donate! Oh and don’t forget. Quistis is the worst
ffviii was my first final fantasy so i’m happy to watch it get crushed this gdq! ♥️
In reference to last year's FFIX run, is it too early to ask about Eiffel 65 facts? #bluedabadee
Whatever...
#SaveTheHotdogsEnjoying the run alot guys. Best of luck and here's to see the blindfolded menu, or whatever...
Absolutely loving the run and the couch commentary is fantastic! So entertaining! I mean...whatever
Blindfolded Hype
FF8 is one of my favourite games of all time, so this is the perfect time to donate alongside some FF8 Fun Facts!!Fact 1: The awesome Dollet mission theme "The Landing" is actually the 2nd version of that song, it was changed before release because the original sounded too close to the main theme of the 1996 movie "The Rock"Fact 2: The French translation of the game has a couple of references not in other versions of the game. The item "Sharp Spike" was renamed to 9 Inch Nail, and the "Slapper" enemies, those hockey players you fight for some reason, were renamed to "Jason" in reference to Friday the 13th.Fact 3: In the 2004 Olympic games, the USA Synchronised Swimming team performed to the songs "Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec" and "Liberi Fatali", eventually winning a bronze medal, so well done to them.
Whatever
Hell yeah and prais Edea! I love Final Fantasy 8. Thanks to the runners and thank you all for this awsome event every year!And lets kick omega weapon in his ass.
Omega Weapon? Whatever.
Here is to Zone for a new train ticket and also for a great event cause. Good luck runners!
Had to donate for one of my most favourite games. Good luck on the run
It's great to see you guys at AGDQ, we've been big fans since seeing you run at RPG Limit Break. This game rules, keep it up!
Very much enjoying the FF8 run by Tojju et al! The puns are great, keep them coming! Greetings from Sweden!
Can't believe that idiot Zell gave Laguna the wrong map.
Great to see all theses guys together on the couch again for several hours : -). Put this towards the blindfolded menuing and keep up the good work.
Great run, love FF games, FF8 is the first one i ever playedLong time watching, finally able to donateHeres 25 to defeating cancer and defeating Omega Weapon
This isn’t where I parked my blue corvette!Put this towards the blindfolded menuing and shoutouts to my wife!
I started unironically listening to Eiffel 65 after the discussion last year.
Man with the Machine Gun SHLAPS!!! If you dont have that on your playlist why do you even have one? Great job so far and thanks for being homies by explaining the story as you go.
I would say Trance Kuja's theme is best, but he's not the final boss.
Yeah, Man with the Machine Gun is alright, but how about the Siivagunner version?
Always love to see skilled runners play my favorite games, and for a good cause? Even better! Keep up the good work!
I know nothing about FF8 but from what I've seen Vriska did nothing wrong.
Best theme is the oath, kupo
The landing. Nuff said.
DreadedSean here, how dare you not say Trance Kuja isnt the best final boss theme in Final Fantasy history (Nekros doesnt count, bad fight)
Extreme? Great final boss song.But it's nowhere near as good as the final fantasy X final boss theme.
Decisive battle from ff3 on snes is the best music
#SaveTheHotdogsMuttski is a skilled player... but that is not normal. Thanks for being a good mate! Let’s get chicken and waffles after this. Tojju can... maybe watch us eat them.
Thanks for this very cool and very long run! FF8 is a pretty special game for me and it's cool to see it at a GDQ. Also, you're right, The Extreme IS the best final boss music.
Galbadia Garden theme best theme, come at me.
My favorite song from 7-10 from the games I played a ton and can remember from the top of my head are as follows:Otherworld - FFX that plays in the boss battle with Jecht, Vamo' Alla Flamenco - FFIX Hot n Cold MG, Man with the Machine Gun - FF VIII, One-Winged Angel - FFVII Safer Sephiroth
Greetings from France, keep it going !
Lets show game glitches and fight cellular glithes!V!
Hi AGDQ,its technically not a FINAL Boss theme, but I love the Trance-Kuja-Theme from the last fight with him in Final Fantasy 9. Keep up the great run, and kick OMEGA in the butt!
normally my favorite final fantasy is six, but tonight... whatever
I woke up extremely early so I could see Final Fantasy VIII. The Balamb Garden music always takes me back to when I first played this game, so it's my pick for best track.
For some reason I really enjoy the Final Fantasy runs, even though I've never played any. Good luck on the run and let's hope RNG is good on you guys!
Hey guys! I'm staying up all night to watch this amazing final fantasy 8 run. I gotta ask, what is everyone's favorite final fantasy summon?P.S. #SavetheHotdogs
Couldn't decide which incentive I wanted to donate towards, the Blindfolded menuing or Defeat Omega Weapon.... so I ended up giving $5 to both of them! Does anyone care to join me?
FF8 was my first ever JRPG and got me started on a 20 year love affair with all things Final Fantasy and JRPGs. Got to Donate for this amazing feat. Ironically my favorite speed run is the longest speed run ^_^
UwU UwU UwU better read this lol
So glad to see a live run from GDQ! Luz, you're awfully quiet my man. You psyching yourself up for the menu? On a side note, my mom was recently given the all clear from breast cancer! I hope this goes some way to help others just like my mom was.
Donating during my favourite Final Fantasy game. Thanks to the runners and everyone at GDQ.
I never expected to see Vriska in a Final Fantasy game. Just shows how much I have to learn.
Shout out to them shoes, great run toeju
Favorite FF jam? FFX's Otherworld is forever in my top spot. Donation to Luz's absolute mad lad menuing.
Best FF Songs are battle theme 1 and Roses of May from Final Fantasy 9 and best Boss battle is fight With Seymour.
I want to see you guys Kompress completion Time! Good luck, guys.
Earlier you asked where the name "Pif" come from. It's from an old comic magazine called "Pif Gadget" that was launched by the French Communist Party. Its mascot was a dog named Pif.The magazine features famous comics like Corto Maltese. And one of the selling point was that in every issues there was a free gift.Regarding the question of my favorite music in FFVIII, I will not be original and say my favorite is Liberi Fatali.
It’s so hard to choose a favorite song from the FF8 soundtrack, it’s all pretty good!Top 3:1. The Stage is Set2. Compression of Time3. Lunatic Pandora
Good morning all! Final Fantasy VIII is my favorite of the series and great to see this group back for this run. The Final Fantasy co-op runs from GDQ and RPGLB have taught me a lot about these games and the people behind the controllers are 10's outta 10! Also, I don't know if Carbuncle is in the run, but could you all name it "Ruby" after my late grandmother? I'd appreciate it and here's to a new record from AGDQ 2020!!!
I've been watching GDQs for seven years now and it's prompted me to pick up speedrunning myself. Personal favorite Final Fantasy games were 7, then 10, then Die Hard in that order. This, however, was before the absolutely amazing/fantastic/emotional game that FF14: Shadowbringers was. I know it was just an expansion, but I'd vote for it as game of the decade! Today, also, it is a sponsor of yours! For every FF fan, go play it. For everyone who has played it: Remember...remember that we once lived.
Greetings from Down Under! Had to donate for my first and favourite FF game. You guys are doing great! We obviously won't see too many this run but what is your favourite GF Summon animation and why is it Eden?
There's so much amazing music in Final Fantasy it's hard to decide a favorite but what I like to do is listen to Those Who Fight Further in my car. One Winged Angel is my favorite final boss theme.
Whatever..
Greetings from Germany. I loved the FF9 run last year and this run is awesome too! Are we going to see a FFX run in the near future? Shoutout to Eiffel65 and all my friends who work right now cause they didnt took days off!
We should all strive to make plans like General Caraway, screaming at one another from halfway across the street and running around demonstrating EXACTLY where we want them to stand and what we want them to do all the while standing in front of the place where said plan is going to happen. Don't forget about cancelling all the traffic to the area to make sure no one could possibly see what the plan is in this wide-open space. Donation to show Omega who's boss!
donating during final fantasy run for maximum 'whatever' energy. cancer took my best friend in 2019 and is now threatening me. let's fight this, every little bit helps. big thank you to everyone in front of and behind the camera for making this possible. much love <3
Hi guys, long time lurker first time donator. Pleased to finally catch ff8 live. Good luck to all runners.
The Man with the Machine Gun is clearly the best track from any Final Fantasy. Crazy Motorcycle Chase from FF7 is a close second.
Mock Paris is a world-dominating military nation in this game? This really is a fantasy game heeeyyoooo
How are y’all sleeping on “Otherworld” from FF10? That whole OST is straight bangers though.
Hey guys, always love watching all your streams, and especially love seeing you all streaming a co-op Final Fantasy run at GDQ once again. I've been watching GDQ for years, but this year it's a little different. In May of 2019 my wife was diagnosed with Stage 3 eye cancer, and it's been an incredibly life changing experience. I donate every year, but this time it means so much more. Thank you to GDQ and everyone involved for making this incredible event that goes to such an incredible cause. Good luck on the run, you guys rock.
I'm sorry are people forgetting the masterpiece that is Clash on the Big Bridge!?
Laguna
Man with the Machine Gun
best track is coming up, Premonition, in the sorceress fight!
It´s morphin time! GO OMEGA!
It's time we fight like men. And ladies. And ladies who dress like men. For Gilgamesh...IT IS MORPHING TIME! Best theme is obviously Battle on the Big Bridge.
Man with the machine gun
If the donation train is 5.50 instead, we make more money every time.Loving the run and the commentary. Keep it up, only 6 more hours
Someone calling for a donation train? I prefer a donation run since its apparently faster! Good luck to the runners on this mammoth run
Favourite Final Fantasy song is Battle on the Big Bridge from Final Fantasy V, my favourite from 8 is Waltz for the Moon
FFXIV has so much great music - but Brute Justice has got to be one of the best!
choo choo
Never played a Final Fantasy game before, I feel like a marathon might not be the best toe dip, but oh boy are you guys entertaining.
Dancing Mad is actually the best though
Dono trail for blind menu and long form runs FTW!
The best FF music is Otherworld from Final Fantasy 10.P.S. let's get that Omega Weapon incentive met!
Those who fight further, especially by the black mages. On the donate train!
Joining the donation train with Rufus the dog in New Zealand. Great run guys!
The Extreme, J E N O V A, Crisis Core's Encounter and Necron's theme from FF9..I think its TIME to say One Winged Angel isn't the best. Fight me
Best Final Fantasy song of all time.... the intro to FFX. The Rammstein song played during the blitzball game when sin attacks couldn't be more perfect.
 (Comment rejected)
"One Winged Angel" is the best boss theme by far. Incentive goes to the ex-seed-ingly hard Omega Weapon.
On the topic of Final Fantasy music... Hot take: The Extreme is better final boss music than either Dancing Mad or One-Winged Angel.
hopping on the train! choo choo!
Jenova Absolute (last jenova fight) is the best.
Greetings from Germany. My brother survived cancer as a kid and i can't resist to donate to such a great cause.My favorite Final Fantasy songs are both from Final Fantasy VII. Aerith's Theme and Cosmo Canyon.My donation goes equally to the Blind Menuing and the Omega Weapon Incentive.Keep up the great run.
Much as I love both Big Bridge and Decisive Battle, the Man with the Machine Gun is clearly my favorite FF tune.
Just woke up and absolutely had to donate during the best Final Fantasy ever made. That’s right. You heard me. This $10 is going toward defeating Omega Weapon because I need to see this runner do what I never could. Whatever.
This is my first run as a Human. So here take these 25 dollars to help protect me by preventing cancer. Also go defeat that Omega Weapon. Go team #SelphieTrains!
Here's my $10, split between the blindfold menuing and Omega Weapon incentives. Let's get those incentives met!
My favourite Final Fantasy music is the one that goes dun dun dun dun do do do do do do
My favorite would have to be from FF Tactics. Let’s go with Trisection.
CHUUUU CHUUUUU
Does anyone remember last year during the ff9 run we made Matthew go on a late night coffee run by calling him out on the steam? Let's do it again? Does anyone need a latte? I'll donate again with an update if this gets read on steam.
AYAYA
No love for the unique music of Final Fantasy Mystic Quest? That game had a great battle theme. If the couch doesn’t agree, whatever.
Best Song? Hymm of the Faith in FFX. Best end theme? Dancing Mad. Good luck on the run!
FF8 will always have a special place in my heart as the first Final Fantasy I ever played and getting me into the series. Absolutely love seeing the incredible skills at display here. Never had the patience to defeat Omega Weapon myself, so here's to that!
Favorite music is ff4 within the giant for sure. Put this toward Omega weapon.
Awesome Games Done Quick can have little a Final Fantasy VIII. As a treat.
liberi fatali is the best song in final fantasy 8, but whatever. (donation goes to defeat omega weapon)
Greetings from the UK. Love FF8, was my first Final Fantasy game and still one of my absolute favourites. The Extreme was an epic boss song, but gotta say that 'The Landing' is probably my number 1 song on the entire soundtrack. Best of luck with the run!
Can we talk about how Shiva's boss song Oblivion from ff14 is the best boss song because it clearly is
I donate 8 dollars for the very best Final Fantasy game - and then added one.This objective result is based on my long and rigorous research of having only played FF7.I have enjoyed all the FF runs, and this is no exception. Keep up the good work! and kick cancer's butt!
Love this run, thank you guys for running it. Also, "Fisherman's Horizon" is one of the best Final Fantasy city songs!
Omega Weapon? Whatever...
Woke up to go to the bathroom but staying up for my favorite FF'
Otherworld from FFX is pretty hype.
How can we be talking about Final Fantasy music and NOT bring up Blinded by Light from FF13
Unfortunately Omega Weapon doesn't get its own boss theme, but fortunately Force Your Way is amazing no matter how many times I hear it.
I love 'The Extreme', however my favourite track from ff8 is 'The Legenday Beast', though it wasn't until I heard the full version on the soundtrack. It's such a shame you get only to hear what amounts to the intro of it ingame. (It plays towards the end of the griever stage of the boss battle until you advance to the next phase iirc)
G'day from Australia! Glad this is one of the runs that lines up with my timezone and sleep schedule. Favourite Final Fantasy song is Blue by Eifel 65 - unironically. Best of luck on the run - donation goes to the runner's and couch's choice - $5 to each of the 5 gentlemen on screen.
Idunno man, my fav either gotta be Chicken Tenders or Titania's theme from FFXIV. There's something about them that I really like.(P.S. This is my first time donating to an event like this. Cancer is something that runs in my family and anything that can improve the research and treatment for it, I'm in! This little amount might not be much, but it's better than nothing at all. Thank you so much to AGDQ, all the runners and the staff working on the event. This donation goes to my mom that battled breast cancer quite recently and is still in the screening stage for her 5-year clear mark.)
Love these longer Final Fantasy runs the last couple years, bringing up random references, like last years Eiffel 65 parade is part of the charm. Idiocracy was an amazing movie. Good luck on the run guys and lets kick cancer.
There's so much great music in the Final Fantasy series that it's hard to pin down a single stand-out track. But I will say that the best version of the Prelude is the arrangement from Final Fantasy 4.
Any eiffel 65 fans? Put this dono to getting Dave a headset - him sitting there and not getting to talk is a real bummer!
Best Final Fantasy music is Not Alone from Final Fantasy IX
Greetings from the back couch. We're loving the run back here, but can anyone bring us a bunch of Red Bulls? We could use a little pick-me-up.
Dancing Mad by far the best theme for the Best Villain!
Grüße aus Deutschland
New to the community, but love what you guys do. Keep it up, or whatever.
Greetings from Poland. Favourite FF music? Fisherman's horizon, Terra from ff9 and Birth of a god from ff7
FF14: Shadowbringers Main Theme, beat out 30 years of amazing FF music.
Just saying, Terra's Theme is best Final Fantasy song. Cheers from the live studio audience!
‘blinded by light’ from ffxiii is a BOP!
Hey guys, good luck on the RNG. Fun fact, the parade dancers are doing the Thriller dance.
Hard to choose just one, but if I have to pick my favorite song from Final Fantasy is You Are Not Alone from FFIX. Donation to Dave’s choice.
Whatever =D
Great to see the boys back again to run FFVIII; I really loved their FFIX run last year and have been following them since. As we're talking about the music, I'd have to say Find Your Way is my favourite track in the game. Good luck on the run guys!
The landing and force your way through are some of my favorite tracks from final fantasy. love seeing this event when its on good luck to the runners, shout out to the commentators. great crowd great cause.
My favorite final fantasy... oh right wrong vote, i can't believe it has been 10 years already here is for at least 10 more!Also best FF non-combat track is You Are Not Alone from FF9, But for the best combat track i might have to go with Force Your Way.
brass de chocobo.
I'll toss in my own hottake for music: Electric de Chocobo from FF7 is the best music in the series, fight me if you disagree. Donation goes to current runner's choice.
Everyone Hurry! to think of a good donation comment about the songs of Final Fantasy. It's a series that's Dear to the Heart, but Don't be Afraid - I know you can Find your Way and be The Winner. You have the SeeD of greatness within you! It's not always Roses and Wine though. Sometimes, it's more of a Shuffle or Boogie, or even a Waltz for the Moon. And that's just the Truth.
hello from France, FF4 is my favorite FF and the music "theme of love" is by far my favorite video game music
Favorite final boss track is Necron's theme from FFIX, wonderfully creepy. Favorite track overall though has to be You're Not Alone also from FFIX. I kinda like that game.
Nobody seems to mention FFXV! wheres the love for apocalypsis aquarius or valse di fantastica
Controversial I'm sure, but one of my favorite Final Fantasy tracks is Beauty's Wicked Wiles, Lakshmi's theme from FFXIV!
Best FF boss theme: Insatiable from FF14: Shadowbringers!
FF8 is probably the first long game I've finished, and still has a special place. Thanks to runners and organizers for the treat that GamesDoneQuick!
First time donation from me in the UK but i've been watching since 2017. Hello to all the runners doing this for a good cause. The best final fantasy song for me is Vamo' allá Flamenco, but, ...whatever.
Woke up early to catch the FF run this year as well, super hyped to see more FF showed at GDQ. I cast my vote for the dark messenger from FF9 for best battle theme! Also shoutout to my favorite FF8 sports team... the trabia rockets. I'll see myself out
 (Comment rejected)
Question for Muttski: Think you'll be able to open the valve first try? Also got put it out there but Man with a Machine Gun is jam.
Hey Guys! Greetings from an American volunteering in Nepal! It’s freezing cold here, so all the schools in my district are closed this week. The 3g gods are shining down on me so I can stream some wholesome ff time with my favorite speed runners. Thank you for the well needed laughs. Xx <3
Regarding music... Muttski, what's your favorite Blink song?
Cancer is going down! Thank you for running this game you are very fun to watch. Also my favorite track in FF8 is Fisherman's Horizon
The FFVIII run has been great so far! All the runners and couch have made this a very enjoyable experience. Thank you for running one of my favorite games and for all that you do!
Was looking for a good place to donate...and there may no be a better place, like beginning of this "dog dream" part of the game, after main character death)
I look forward to AGDQ each year. FInal Fantasy 8 is a blast from my childhood. My Mom who passed away in 2018 after a long fight with cancer, would say "All the little things, are the big thing." So here is another little thing, for this amazing event. Annoucers Choice
I know everyone is saying their "Favorite" FF songs but we all know they're just saying their second fave. We all know the best song in the history of Final Fantasy is the Chocobo theme from FF2.
Mean Guy just giving Zell what he deserves for all his screwups.
Best ffxiv song is Answers from ffxiv
Okay, but Real Emotion from FFX-2? Come on, who's jaw didn't drop when they saw idol Yuna?!
My favorite song from Final Fantasy 8 is the Ending theme because it plays at the best bit of the game.
Best FF song? Clearly Answers from FF XIV.
Best Final Fantasy Final Boss Music? FFXIV's "Answers" , NO CONTEST!
Nooon ! J'ai raté le début de la run de FF 8 ! Zut et flûte ! Heureusement c'est pas fini. (Pour le bel hommage à Ariane <3)Merci pour vos commentaires, vos blagues et jeux de mots, vos moments de culture. On vous aime. Je vous aime, même vous le chat. Tout ça c'est grâce à VOUS !#Tempetedesang c pour 1 ami
best song in final fantasy is the castle! anyway, having fun so far, good luck to all the runners.
Final fantasy IX you're not alone scene gets me every time . To all don't forget Kweeek
AGDQ is my favorite time of the year. Thank you for spreading positivity with this wonderful event every year and keep up the great work, all of you guys. Much love from Czech Republic!
Hello all! This is my first time watching GDQ, thanks to my awesome best friend, Lawlsy, and I'm donating for him in honor and memory of his father who passed away from cancer. I want to give a big shout-out of thanks to all the runners and donors for supporting this wonderful cause in memory of their own loved ones to change the lives of others and their loved ones. God bless you all!!
First donation this AGDQ, love the work you're doing! My first Final Fantasy game was FFX, so To Zanarkand will always have a special place in my heart. It's also the only piece I can play on the piano
The Great Warrior from FFVII will always be my personal favorite. When you tie it to the scene that it plays in, it's one of the most memorable FF moments for me
Three FF songs always give me chills and they are Terra's theme from FFIV, Cosmo Canyon and Unforgettable Sorrow from FFIX. Best final boss theme is tied with The Extreme and Necron's theme with an honourable mention going to Dark Messenger since we used to sing We Will Rock You to its drum beat.
Best FF Boss music Battle On The Big Bridge
Run is great guys, Tojju killed disc 1. However, you're all wrong and The Oath is easily the best song in FF8, not close. Here's to the rest of our early morning adventures with the orphanage gang.
 (Comment rejected)
My favorite final fantasy song is "suteki da ne / isn't it wonderful" but specifically a version sung by spike vegeta. My donation goes towards spike singing it. Please. No really. Ill love you forever.
What a great game to wake up to! Speaking of mornings.... what does every moogle need in the morning? A KUPO coffee! Keep up the good work everyone!
I'm a "Main Theme" from VII type of guy. Getting all nostalgic when it comes on. Original, piano, orchestra - they're all beautiful.
Thank you for running my favorite game.
Même si je suis malade, je refuse de rater la run de Cadence of Hyrule demain matin, et j'espère qu'on va avoir le nom du fichier ! Si même une partie d'entre nous donnons l'équivalent d'un Kebab, on l'aura en moins de deux ! #GDQup
Is Laguna a VR trooper? Love the speedrun 🤠👌
Please much more love for APOCALYPSIS NOCTIS from FF15. And don't forget Aranea Highwind. The best character that Square-Enix has brought into the world after FF10.
It may not be the final boss theme of its game, but Theme of AYA is the best song in any Final Fantasy.
thanks for the stream :)
Donating to show some love for the one true FF song.......Quina's Theme
Good Morning GDQ, day 4 let's go! Props to you all for staying up all night. Waltz to the moon is my favorite and I'm sad I missed it overnight but can't wait for eyes on me later today. Thank you all for the hard work.
As much as FF8 is my favourite game. My favourite FF song is still Cosmo canyon.
A question for the runners! Is there a reason why you're running the PS1 version on PS2, instead of one of the PC or console ports? Great work, everyone.
Had to leave a donation during my favorite game of all time, FF8! So excited to see such an underrated game and run getting its time in the spotlight. Putting this donation towards the OoT glitch exhibition in memory of an old friend who was sadly taken from us far too soon. Most of my best childhood memories are playing FF8 or Ocarina with him when we were in middle school, and texting each other nonstop during AGDQ every year! Thanks for everything you all do!
When I saw they were running FF8 at a GDQ, I didn't want to be a chicken wuss and not donate! Here's to my favorite Final Fantasy game and junctioning "Encounter-None" to cancer forever. Good luck to the runners!
Guys, come on. The best FF track is "Cantata Mortis & God in Fire" from FF: Dissidia 012 Duodecim. It's two tracks in one!
Crazy Chocobo from Final Fantasy XIII-2 is clearly the best song.
Was I the only kid who did not understand the battle system on his first playthrough, and became over-reliant on GF attacks?So. Much. Mashing. And I could never beat Adele.On the second playthrough I steam-rolled her...Thank you for this run :)
FF VIII was my first Final Fantasy! Still love it to this day. Good luck with the run
Unbelievable. Obviously the best Final Fantasy track is the Chocobo Theme and its many variations. In fact if you look up what a Bop is online the definition is just a link to the song. Thanks to all you guys making the event happen! Keep it up!
My favorite part of any final fantasy run: stairs! Just wanted to take this time to call out my favorite line from final fantasy 8: “....”
The best Final Fantasy battle theme is without a doubt Conflict's Chime from Bravely Default. But I guess if that doesn't count, then I'll have to go with Trisection from Final Fantasy Tactics. Can't have the numbered titles get all the recognition now.
Wakka's Gourmet Race is objectively the best Final Fantasy track. Good luck with the rest of the run guys you're killing it! #SaveTheHotdogs
Is it just me or does Irvin have a huge resemblance to Micheal Jackson from the Billie Jean music video?I absolutely love FF8 and seeing these guys rip through it absolutely makes my day. Keep up the awesome run guys!
Best FF song: The EXTREME!!!!
"Fithos Lusec Wecos Vinosec", "The Man With The Machine Gun", and "Maybe I'm A Lion" are some of my favorite Final Fantasy soundtrack songs. Also, let's get a $10 train going to help reach 600k during this run! 600k hype!
Goodluck to all the runners of this mammoth Final Fantasy run.I’ve not played FF8 since it was originally released, and I never quite appreciated at the time how terrible all the characters are at doing their job!
Target aquired. Maximum HONK initated.HONKalavista, baby.
In tribute to Ariane Carletti who died of cancer in 2019. She co-animated a children's show between 1987 and 1997. (all my childhood) #DVVol2
Thanks for running a game I have fond memories of playing through way back in high school. HONK!
Good morning mates, glad to see everyone is up and running still! Can't wait to see that blindfold menu!
Great run and loving this event you guys rock.
Wow, this internet speed. Almost as fast as this run.PS: Good Luck and Godspeed for all the players.
Rushed home to catch the rest of the FF8 run live. Seeing my favourite FF runners back again in the event brings back sweet memories of a certain Europop band. Tell me, why Haus no one suggested Eiko as name for Griever yet?Anyway, good luck on the run and greetings from Germany!
FF8 was my first final fantasy, always has a special place in my heart. Good luck to all the runners, crew and everyone there!
Awesome to see Final fantasy 8 at GDQIt has always been one of my favorite games.Cant wait to here You sing an amazing songGood Luck on the Run
Love this game even though I never beat it. Good luck with the rest of the run
I love you guys. Keep fighting cancer. <3
Valve minigame so easy luzOkay
Watching the tracker, looks like people are getting a little tired and the flow is slowing down. Can we get an $8 train going? It's FF VIII after all! Huge props to the runners and the couch. Keep up the amazing work and trash cancer.
Greetings from Australia. I recently played FF8 again and found a lot to love. Thanks to all the staff who keep this event running and good luck to the runners!
Hey AGDQ ! Big fan of the event ! Lost my dad to cancer, and decided to donate every year to help :) So glad to watch FFVIII speedrun, as it is my favorite game ! Keep up the good work ! You guys rock !Greetings from France
Loving the event and everyone involved, so here's another 50 HONKS!!!!!!!
Hi AGDQ,I watched two times the FF9 run from AGDQ2019. Loved it! Runners and hosts were the funiest!I watch again this one when the replay will be available.Put this toward the BLUE 55 menuing! :DThanks for all the good work!
Hello there Muttski the angel from my nightmare, the shadow in the background of the morgue... yeah you know how this goes anyways don't waste your time on me you're already dealing with the deamons inside Squall's headgreetings from France =)
Loving the run but you're almost where I am at in my first playthrough! I'll have to stop watching soon!
Let's get the $8 train hype moving for Final Fantasy 8! Let's hit 600,000 before the 5 hour mark!! CHOO CHOO HONK.
Love watching this event every year, especially the Final Fantasy runs. Many thanks to everyone involved in GDQ - keep up the great work!
FF8 is the bet FF. Prove me wrong. The soundtrack is amazing and all the Garden/Seed lore is just what I wanted to be when I grew up lol. GG!
I couldn't do this in 9 hours on triple speed with the remaster... Had to make my first donation to my favourite game of all time. Money can go to which ever incentive is closest or runners choice. Chickenwuss
Final Fanatsy VIII <3
Long time viewer, first time donator. My longtime FFXIV gaming friend got cancer twice and beat it both times and I am real glad he is still around. Hopefully one day we get rid of cancer for good. Keep doing awesome work in AGDQ.
=)
My mom kicked cancer's ass a couple of years ago. It left her disabled, but she's alive and that's what matters. Here's all I can miss right now :)
So glad to be seeing FF8 being run live! I have to miss the second half because I'm going to work now so good luck on that blindfolded menuing!
This goes out to the group of runners that got me into watching speedrunning. I wouldn't be watching this incredible event live if it weren't for all of you and a donation is the least I can do for this great cause.
Had a tough time staying awake last night, but I'm here this morning and the Mutt is still going. Hope that practice paid off
Always love seeing a run of one of my top 3 FFs. Thank you to runners and staff for the event, you're all doing great work.
Much love to GDQ chat for starting these donation trains <3
Donating for the very first time and had to do it during my favourite game of all time Final Fantasy VIII! Keep up the good work everyone!
Donating during my favorite Final Fantasy game of all time! Excited to see this game crushed!
$8 train hype!!!
Donating for me and my friends who cannot! Big love bambam and gem!
A sheep, a drum, and a snake fall off a cliff.Bah dum, tss.
Aloha from Hawai'i! Final Fantasy XIII is one of my favorite games from my childhood and now. Mahalo to everyone supporting this wonderful cause!
Missed the first half of this FFVIII run because I stayed up too late watching Terraria. Glad to see Badger lives on in this run! Spread that Positive Mental Attitude. Lord knows, Squall could use it!Final Fantasy $8 donation train!
NORG-DEMANDS-A-HOT-POCKET
Great job guys! Love to see an amazing game being run and explained by such a skilled and knowledgable crew. There's always money in the banana stand!
Merci aux organisateurs, commentateurs, artistes et au chat d'etre present a chaque evenement. La peinture Sekiro est tellement stylé #Tempetedesang
Gotta donate for the best final fantasy game ever ! Played hundreds and hundreds of hours as a kid and still love it to this day!
 (Comment rejected)
You guys are all wrong! The best Final Fantasy song is Fight Against Culex
will you save the hot dogs
Long time watcher, but my first time being able to donate, had to do it when one of my favorite franchises is being run, Final Fantasy!! Good luck to all of the runners!!
Hey guys, my friends and I are doing a Final Fantasy Challenge this year - 12 games in 12 months! This has been awesome to watch - i just hope you dont Choke-obo. Shoutout to Stew and Scoot, or whatever.
Thank you for endless hours of entertainment!
Greetings from FRANCE !My mom bought me this game when it came out. She's blind, but she enjoyed sitting next to me when I played, she loved the musics. Thank you AGDQ, keep up the good work !!
Final fantasy 8 is my favorite FF since I was a kid. Love watching this run. Thank you to everyone at GDQ and all the runners.
I gotta stick up for Zell. Him opening his mouth didn't affect much, since the President was immediately usurped by Edea, who already knew who to retaliate against. The missile attack on Balamb would have happened regardless.
As someone who grew up next to it, donating 1 dollar for each point on a ten point scale that assessment of PEI gets.
Nova Scotian here, solar panels aren't immensely popular in the Maritimes
Do you have a moment to talk about the Garden Festival Committee?
10/10 Accurate.
"It's no problem, We're just glad nobody got hurt... Now don't you go fighting." Is very very Atlantic Canada. So accurate!
I'm a landlocked Canadian, but Fisherman's Horizon perfectly matches the Maritimes of my imagination.
Love waking up to AGDQ! If I could live in any FF universe, it would be in Final Fantasy IV. Moon people, flying whales, and a cast with a whole lot of heart. What's not to love?
If I had to live in any city in the FF Universe, it would be Insomnia. The city looks beautiful. A close second is AltissaDonation goes to current relay runners choice
New babby means I couldn't stay up for the start of the run, but I had to drop a donation on some of my favorite runners and one of my favorite games. FF7-10 relay next GDQ? Let's do it!
As a native Prince Edward Islander I feel personally attacked; but, yeah.... pretty accurate.
Can't believe it, One and only time PEI will get a shoutout and so I got to donate.
Long time viewer, sometimes donator.If I had to choose a town from FF8 to live in, it would be Dollet. Sure the snakes are huge, but Dollet looks like it has REALLY good restaurants. So, it would kinda even out...? Maybe...?Keep up the good work on one of my favorite FF games, and kick cancer in the teeth.
I don't live in Prince Edward Island but my mother runs a small inn on an island in New Brunswick. Also, 9 hour estimate on the most broken FF game from my childhood? That's shocking.
I also have a brother memory with FFVII. I played all day on our old PS1 and hadn't saved the game and my older brother came home and shut the system off.
Donating for the third time first thing in the morning. Kudos to those who stayed awake for the entire run so far. And for those of you who are falling asleep...HONK!
Final fantasy 8 was my first introduction to the franchise and still by far my favorite. Watching you guys play and im still learning new things about the game. Still love those GF animations
Good cause and good games, spent my whole childhood playing almost every final fantasy. Always great to see AGDQ
Donating in honor of my Grandfather that lost his fight to cancer many years during one of my favorite games. Good luck to all runners. Run fast and honk frames!
In tribute to Ariane Carletti who died of cancer in 2019. She co-animated a children's show between 1987 and 1997. (all my childhood) #DVVol2All in Ariane -> Cadence of Hirule
Snow day in Nova Scotia, so now I get to stay cozy in bed and watch AGDQ all day. It's the dream!PS: Thank you to the runners for this fantastic run, you guys rule!
How. Absolutely. Dare. You. be so funny right now. I'm supposed to sleep like a normal person! I don't even like FF8! I am offended and thank you and good luck with the rest of the run, you maniacs!
Pour Ariane, comme disait la chansonLe monde saura bientôtQue son esprit reste avec nous#CoeurBleu
The fantastic gentlemen running this game have had a profound impact on me in the past few years I've known them. Great guys. Question for Muttski... What is the best Final Fantasy and why is it Parasite Eve?
Do you want an Aura Stone?
Hey Muttski! You and the boys make us all proud. Can’t wait to hear your Eyes On Me remix, so Carry Armor.
Good Luck on the Run Runners! Love Watching you guys!What does every Moogle need in the morning?A Kup-o Coffee!
Je suis enfin assez grand pour donné à cette événement que je suis depuis quelque année et qui me touche particulièrement cette fois ci car j'ai perdu une amie proche d'un cancer il y a quelque mois.
FF8 my favorate game. Good Luck to all the Runners and the GDQ team, u do a Great Job!
Here's $25 for Davesterio's choice. I'm a big fan of his Twitch, even if I'm usually lurking.
Fantastic games deserve donations for a good cause.The money goes towards the Ocarina of Time Glitch Exhibition, because those are always good fun. And we need to keep this marathon going for as long as possible!
Doink! (Donation goes to runners choice)
I accidentally ran into and defeated Omega Weapon the first time i played FFVIII - Selphie had autoinitiative and the limit break bangles at low health - the first and only time I saw "the End" happen. Hopefully you'll get just as quick an end in your speed run... in like a squall, out like a HONK!!!
Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Badger Mushroom Mushroom HONK
Had to donate during my favorite Final Fantasy game! Good luck on the rest of the run, Muttski!
Sitting at home with a sick child is the perfect excuse to watch more AGDQ! Thank you for putting on this event each year, and good luck to all the runners!
I hope this small amount will contribute to help many people.
Warm greetings from Germany. still waiting for the fight against Omega, this will be a tohuwabohu.
Love FF8! I'm so happy to see this run! Can't walt for the singing!
 (Comment rejected)
These Final Fantasy Co-op relay are slowly becoming my favorite part of GDQ! Keep up the good work!
Can't wait to see the Blind Fold Menuing
Good morning GDQ! I wish I could've have been up for the entirety of the FFVIII run, as it was my first and favorite Final Fantasy. Good luck to all the runners and Force Your Way through this run!
Zell, you and me. Showdown. Noon. Bring it on.
I'm sick and staying home because of it. Watching you guys do one of my favorite games ever is a good consolation. Thanks a lot!
Never played FF 8, good to see thqat finally anyone really been far as decided to use even go want to do look more like Honk?
Hey Muttski, Felly here. Sadly I couldn't travel to AGDQ this time around; had to use time off for my grandfather who passed away back in October. Here's hoping to see you at Limit Break 2020.PS: I have a clue for you to submit next GDQ: A-hahahahaha....~
Just came home from work here in Sweden. Super happy to be able to catch the last few hours of this FF8 run. Keep up the good work!
FF8 is great m8 @Luzbel strong Squall is not faster
Long time watcher, had to donate during my favorite Final Fantasy game. Cannot believe you can fight the Captain without doing all of the back and forth. Blew my mind! Thanks for all you do!
Final Fantasy 8 is one of my all time favorite games and holds a special place in my heart. I own 2 copies of the game, one of them belonging to a good friend that passed away at a young age. Good luck on the run and show Ultemicia that all existence WONT be denied
Final Fantasy 8 is one of my favourite games of all time, and AGDQ one of my favourite streams on Twitch. I wonder how many times the dialogue button has been clicked. Three hours to go. Keep on clicking!
tuned in to hear you say shout out nova scotia. well nova scotia loves you tooits not much but it all helps!cheers!
I've got a 50$ donation from that anonymous guy that says I've got a 50$ donation from that anonymous guy that says... wait what? That are not my words. That's what the donation comment reads. No seriously I'm not making that up! I'm just reading what is written on this screen. You don't understand, that's not me speaking! AHHHHH I'm trapped, please help me!!!
You guys are doing a great job with the commentary, from revealing easter eggs, summarizing the plot, and meme-ing out! Keep up the good work! And shoutout to SophLUL for introducing me to speed runs!
Looking good over there doods, especially Luz~ Good luck with the run~
<3
I know I missed it last night, but I'm donating after that incredible 2 players 1 controller blindfolded run with zallard1 and sinister1. Put $50 to zallard's choice and $50 to sinister's choice.
Best Final Fantasy ever!!
In the JP version, Zell loves filled breads! Things like melonpan. They dont translate well.
Zell loves Pan in the JP version of FF8
Had to donate during FVIII: Save the frames, save the hotdogs
HONK!
I was finally starting to doze off when I heard "EVEN IN... DEATH, YA!" and popped right up. I remember when I learned that Wakka was voiced by the same dude who does Bender from Futurama and now all I can hear is Bender calling me a rotten son of a shoopuf when I replay FFX. It haunts me almost as much as Quistis dab dancing. Donation goes to runner's choice, and I'll double it if the couch does the Tidus laugh in unisonP.S. Honk cancer
Very fond memories of playing this and the other PS1 FFs when I was younger, my mother loved the stories in them too. Thanks from Australia and keep up the good fight!
I know I speak for everyone when I say this... FOR THE HOT DOGS!!!
The combination of awesome gameplay, hilarious commentary, jaw-dropping prizes, and an awesome cause just make me want to donate more and more. Keep on keeping on folks!!
FF8 is my favorite FF. Ive played it so many times but never made it past Disc 3 cause things came up and when I came back to play I had to start over to get the story straight. This run has inspired me to sit down and finally finish it. Thanks for running it, learned a lot and can't wait to see the rest of the runs. Lets beat last years donations!
Glad to wake up and catch the second half of this FF8 run. Muttski always has the best commentary.
Regarding what Zell likes and what the Balamb Garden cafeteria sells; It varies between versions:USA & UK : Hot Dogs.French: Pretzels,Spanish: CHORIZO sandwiches.I do believe that Italian & German versions have different items too.(Greetings from Spain!)
I tried to take Selphie the other day with a girl who had an Eye on me, but I had no Edea where to find my camera. Well In The End I asked a someone to Zell me his.Oh, and let's get in some Animorphs.
Missed most of the run but I wouldn't dare miss the boys and their sultry pipes belting out the classic Tupac song All Eyez On Me. That, and Luzbel's blind menuing. Good luck with the rest of the run mates and never forget, ducks fly together!
5 for 5 minutes tops on rinoa
Go Pats!
The cancer death rate has been falling, on average, 1.5% every year since 1991. Researchers just finished doing statistics for 2016 and 2017 and found a 2.2% drop in cancer deaths between those two years. Remember, every cent counts just like every percent counts!
Final Fantasy 8 is a better game than Final Fantasy 7. If you disagree, tell me in the donation comments!
This Final Fantasy VIII run is a honk! If the couch give me a good honk ill donate another 15.00
So happy you beautiful guys are back running another Final Fantasy game at GDQ! You're great people and great friends - sorry I couldn't make it this time to watch in person. (Also, Hi Alice in the back)
Had to donate during a run of my FAVORITE Final Fantasy game! Thanks for the entertaining run and for another amazing GDQ!
When all hangs in the balance, you must give them hope. For what it's worth I cast my lot with yours. Thank you for continuing to fight and being heroes for all of us!
Hey Guys! Thanks for being awesome. Here's my little contribution :)PS: Luzbehim, see you in SUPA MARIO ODYSSEY he he he...
Whatever.
Join your local labor union, together we bargain, alone we beg.
Final Fantasy VIII? There are 8 of these things now? That's wild. What's next, Final Fantasy 9? Ha ha. What a world we live in.
Loving the run so far, the Final Fantasy runs have become one of our fave parts of the marathons. Also, we also had Hot Dogs in our PAL version, and from a little digging around it seems the Pretzels were only in the French Translation~Keep up the good work AGDQ, donation goes to announcers choice.
Glad to wake up in time to watch the end of the run. Good luck runners!
thanks for everything you guys are doing. have a nice day of breezy runs
I lost both mom and dad this year to cancer. What quickly became apparent is that there will always be humor, and there will always be games. Thinking back to all those years of playing games with both of them fills me with love and hope, and that hope flares as I watch you guys tear through games from my youth, and one of my favorite franchises in Final Fantasy. Love from Michigan in this fight against Cancer!
I'm so happy to wake up to the FF8 run going strong. Thanks for the hard work everyone!
#SaveTheHotdogs Hey Tojju Mutt and Luz, fantastic run and commentary so far from everyone - love seeing the FF with my favourite battle music and vocal theme getting the GDQ treatment, and glad to see the blindfold incentive get met again after last year's very very insane FF9 menu. Let's finish the last third strong and keep the fun going - shoutout to Muttski repping the blink-182 shirt too!
Rinoa is the patron saint of Arm day!
I've been at work, did I miss the Eiffel65 part of the run?
Thanks for embracing your passion AND helping others.
Hey Muttski and Luz, let Davesterio level you to 99 to make the game easier. Best of luck to all the runners at this great event!
...whatever
So glad I was able to catch the Final fantasy 8 run. Thank you all for your amazing work. Cheers from France.
The best part of Squall's speech is that Rinoa could hear it while hanging there, and was likely trying to awkwardly shout encouragement while hanging there
Good morning GDQ friends, thank you for supporting this important cause. This run has been fantastic so far. FF8 is definitely one of my favourites and you've done a great job explaining the lore at the same time while you skip all the dialogue. Have a good rest after this run! P.S.: Laguna is BAE
Let us beat cancer! Love from Norway
Hello from Japan! I'm a huge fan of watching FF speedruns on GDQ. Thank you for your hard work, runners.
For all its flaws, FFVIII was the first game to carry any real sort of emotional impact for me. Thanks for this run, gentlemen. Squall is dead.
Look forward to the final fantasy run at AGDQ every year, happy to contribute to a great cause!
I just had to donate during the Final Fantasy 8 block because this was one of my fondest gaming memories.Unfortunately I have been unable to watch as much as I want to live because I just started a new job this week after recovering from a massive company layoff from my previous company.
Lost my parents to lung cancer three years ago, keep up the fight!
Best wishes on the run. Wanted to play this game for myself before the event but i didn't have time so I guess I'll just spoil myself! Hope you don't get unlucky or bad RNG.
Hello from The Netherlands. I just got my last 2 wisdom teeth pulled, now 'enjoying' the after feeling with some AwesomeGDQ. Keep up the good work and lets beat cancer! HONK!
This is one of my favorite games! Keep up the great work!
FF8 Remake when?
Should’ve said this earlier in the run, but it’s so fun watching you guys. PS you reminded me how much I hate Wakka. Not sure how. Cheers, from Chicago!!

$5 for making me laugh at a "your mom" joke. I'll donate another $5 if you can make me laugh again.
Loving this run despite knowing nothing at all.I'll donate again, if the sofa answers this riddle:What goes through fields and cities, but never moves.
Love this trio running Final Fantasy games. Muttski could probably make the story of Metroid: Other M interesting. Probably.
Donating during my favorite game - I listen to the soundtrack still to this day! This goes to Bonus Game, Animorphs. The *other* Guardian Force.
The string of long FF speed runs over the last few GDQs have been my favorite runs by far! I'm never able to watch them live, but I always go back and watch them from beginning to end when I get time, and I'm always impressed by the runners' endurance and skill in navigating these games. The nostalgia is real - keep it up guys and thank you GDQ and runners for all you do!
Here you go!
ANIMORPHS!
#FF8AMA - do you like pineapple on pizza 😐
I had to donate during my second favorite Final Fantasy game. This game is easily in the top 15 of all Final Fantasy games made. Easily!
I woke up to catch the second half of this fantastic game. Heck yeah. I mean... whatever. *shrug
#SavetheHotdogsNice to see friends on the couch running a game a lot of people love for a wonderful cause. Caught a good chunk of Mutt's run last night, and glad I get to catch the end here this morning. Also a reminder to Mutt that Eiko is the national best girl of Canada and we won't hear otherwise.
One of my alltime favorite games. Missed most of the Run but glad i can rewatch it these days.Thank you all for the great Event
Of the PS1 Final Fantasy games 8 is the worst, 7 is meh, and 9 is the best. Change my mind.
Perfect time to donate to a great cause, FF8 was the first Final Fantasy game that I played and completed by myself. Good Luck to all runners, and hope we make this another record breaking event!
This will always be my favorite Final Fantasy game, Nobuo Uematsu created a masterpiece soundtrack there. Love seing it @ AGDQ. Thanks to all runners and supporters <3
Now you know Newman's real name
Here is 50 dollars cause I felt like it, all towards the OOT glitch exhibition.
Good morning!
Shout out to the Final Fantasy speedrunning community. Thanks for the memories and thank you for gaming for a good cause.
Greetings from the Galbadian missile base! Internet’s a bit slow here, so hopefully this $9 in honor of Blastoise makes it in before the end of the Pokémon Sapphire run. Good luck on the rest of the run!
Hello, you bright people out there. You have shown me that you really can do anything!
J2 this is from the Benana's with love you're killing it dude. Donation goes to Runner's choice
Awesome run all! I stayed up watching all night so I wouldn’t miss Sin being defeated by the Knights of the Round summon. Good luck Zidane!
Here's $10 that is going towards PCF rather than the spam phone call i just received interrupting my AGDQ watching.
greetings from germany! i came here to say greetings from germany, so greetings from germany!
Great to see such an entertaining Final Fantasy 8 run. Go Badger, Mufasa and co!
Hello guys, light weight baby
Shout out to Squall, the best looking guy here.HONK.
hyyype
Bummed I couldn't watch this whole run live. It's too spooky to watch this game at night given the main character is a ghost/zombie from the end of disc 1 on as clearly the Squall is un-dead is the best theory. Can't wait to watch the vods during the day.One of my favorite games and soundtracks and it looks like you guys are crushing it. Always love Jatwo's dad jokes (though clearly Angelo is an emotional support animal). See you this weekend bud. -Rob
From a former cancer researcher turned educator, I love FF8 and teaching biology! What you're doing is great, let's cut out frames like we cut out cancer!
Greetings from the uk. Got home from a night shift at work just in time for the start of the 8 run, unfortunately fell asleep for most of it but woke up in time for the blindfolded menu with is a marathon highlight every year for me! Good luck and keep up the great work guys!
Amazing job guys!
Final Fantasy 8 is one of my favorite games, and I'm so excited to see it at AGDQ this year! Unfortunately I slept through most of the run, but I know I'll have something great to watch after the event. Thanks for everything you do!
The Final Fantasy series has always been one of my favorite series of all time, getting me through some very rough patches of my life. I am so hyped to see it get the love it deserves every year in AGDQ and I am so hype that we're doing all of this to destroy cancer! Save the Moogles and kill the Malboros! Kupo!
Whatever.
Watched the blindfold incentive for FFIX last year, and seeing it again this year was just as incredible. Good luck with the rest of the run!
Amazing FF8 run, Jaw-Dropping Blindfold Menuing.Bring on the Animorphs!
Woke up and we’re apparently menuing FFVIII blindfolded??? What a great thing to wake up to. Love AGDQ so much!!
Best FF music? I would love to say Civilizations (aka the Rak'tika Greatwoods "la-HEE" song) from FF14, but that just might be trolling. FF14 has tons of excellent versions of old songs and fantastic new ones - so, seriously speaking, the best boss battle theme in my opinion is Insatiable (the Shadowbringers boss theme).Thank you for the endlessly entertaining FF8 run, and to everybody else keeping AGDQ running. Here's for another decade of awesome games for an awesome cause!
After seeing the blindfolded menuing from Luzbelheim and the RECOVERY back to Zell I had to donate. That was ridiculous.
First time donater. Luzbelheim's blind menu management impressed me so much I had to donate! I <3 Squall!
That blindfolded menu! What a lunatic! This donation goes to Luzbelheims choice for his amzing display of skill!
The menuing of legends, very well done!
Another round of applause for Luz! That was incredible! Oh and fuck cancer.
I woke up early to see the end of the FF8 run, and it was worth it to see that blindfolded menuing. Spaaaaace!
It's 7 AM on the west coast and I just woke up in time to see some bananas blind menuing. Great way to start the day!
Greetings from the UK. Props to you, Luz, that was awesome! It's impressive enough when everything goes as it should. I'll donate again if the announcer can pronounce my name correctly :P
I just had to donate when I saw who was running Final Fantasy! An additional $10 if the couch and runner can say "Trans Rights!
How could I not donate for that blindfold menuing? Put this towards runner's choice!
I had to go to bed when this started and I woke up to Luz doing some awesome blindfolded menuing. I'm glad I was able to catch more of one of my favorite games and this amazing part of it live! Y'all are one of my favorite parts of GDQ.!
Epic improv from Luz! Cheers to my favorite FF runners, and I'm looking forward to Omega Whatever. #SaveTheHotdogs
Just made it home from work for the blindfold, gg Luz, gg.
The blindfold menuing was absolutely insane. Can't wait to see the end of the run!
Keep on keeping it up and fighting the good fight!
Amazing FFVIII run and commentary so far! Thank you all so much for making my workday less annoying.
Awesome Blindfolded menu-ing and save! Love seeing you guys get together to do the relay runs. Helps that 8 is my favorite Final Fantasy! Much love and good luck on the rest of the run!
yet another in the chain of people whose minds were blown by that blindfolded menu. woke up JUST IN TIME to see it! keep up the great work.
First time I ever seen a run that started before going to bed and STILL going waking up. Whatever. Here's $15 to the best looking runner in his charity run.
As someone who grew up reading Animorphs and even watching the less-than-amazing tv show, I absolutely HAVE to see the game run!
Amazing blindfold time! HONK
Amazing blindfold menu-ing! Wow! Keep it up everyone! In SPAAAAAACE no one can hear you HOOOOOONK!
Waited all the way till that awesome blindfold menu to donate- -Love the FF community and GDQ! Keep on with the fight against cancer!!
Honks from Chile
Good morning AGDQ! Love waking up to the game I stole my brother's PlayStation to play growing up. My coworker and I stopped what we were doing to watch the blindfolded menuing. Great job and keep up the hype for Wednesday!
lets kick cancers butt :)
What an incredible AGDQ like always thanks to all the staff, the runners and all the viewers, love to everyone // Merci à toute la communauté FR qui se démène pour nous proposer une super AGDQ. Merci à tous, plus petit que 3
I've been loving this Final Fantasy run. It's been on my second monitor all day, while I've been working. It was a great idea having different people run this longer game: it keeps the commentary fresh and funny! It's been one of most entertaining runs I've seen, and I've watched for at least 5 years now. The blindfolded section was *great*! Greetings from Barcelona.
Hello Luz and couch. I just watched the VoD of your FFIX run last week and now FFVIII! I appreciate the comentary and your telling of the story that I wasn't able to complete. Both games that I always to get back to eventually, but life has a way of changing your plans. Coming out of the holiday season, with less and less family members each year the winter blues can be quite devastating. After Badger's Terraria run last night I just wanted to reiterate, "Thank you for doing good in this world." My self diagnosed depression feels lighter knowing that events like this exist. I love this event in more ways than I can put into words. I pray this is the future of professional competition. There are so many in this world that can use a helping hand. Thank you for using your skills to fuel the future rather than succumbing to the material temptations that seems to grab many of our greatest professionals. I love you all. Keep on dancing. Happy 2020!
My father is currently battling cancer, we know it can't be cured anymore because it's already spread over the body but it doesn't stop him from battling for his loved ones. Had to donate for this amazing event. Thanks a lot for doing this, please keep doing this forever. Together we will beat cancer!
When the god itselft is better blindfolded... it's a pleasure to see you're hardwork beeing payed off, you lived this years for this types of moments, Luzbel you're hardwork finally paying off. As always an inspiration for me, from your lovely cousin. Good job Mate.
Thank you to the runners, crew, and viewers for all the good you do during these events.
Sorry I'm late. So when is Moonlord?
#SaveTheHotdogsHurry up, Mutt! I’m waiting for you!AYAYA#GameDeficit
That blindfolded section was mind-blowing... I have to donate.FF8 is my absolute favourite and I am so happy to see y'all running it - good luck runners!
great ff8 gamemake me wanna play again
Have to donate during FFVIII, thanks for the runs!
Squall probably listens to Jimmy Eat World.
I watch Games Done Quick every year since I discovered it! I am happy to see these longer speed runs, and the team of runners skillfully destroying the game. Good luck to them, and thanks to all the staff behind the scenes making this wonderful event possible!
Hey guys! My shift started together with your run and now we are almost through. Felt like we were partners! Hang in there and cudos for a fantastic final fantasy 8 speedrun! Shoutouts to the speed running community, the agdq staff, Isabelle, Domino and Fabian. Best regards from cologne in germany!
I have no idea what I just saw--wait, was I not supposed to be blindfolded, too? Either way, I'm impressed.
I love FF8 and have really fond memories of it, so it's great to see it at GDQ. Blindfolded menuing was amazing! Great work and good luck to the runners the rest of the way!
The final fantasy saga is so incredible I love this saga, the seepdruner are really incredible. Funfac sipher wife edea
Thanks again for another year of wonderful speedruns and the opportunity to donate to a great cause. Part of this donation goes to NOT name Link "Honk"!
Première donnation pour une GDQ, Merci à tout le staff du FrenchRestream pour ce moment! Combattons ensemble cette saleté qu'est le cancer!!! #Kyogre
looking like a clean run, hope all of the donations will help with humanity's efforts to defeat cancer (and our adventurers fated victory to defeat the sorceress)! Also, great commentary by the couch! (Runners choice for incentive)
Had to donate during my all time favorite video game series! Excellent Final Fantasy 8 run, and great commentary from the couch. Lots of love for all that you guys do!
Frick cancer
Space!!!
Love final fantasy 8, always liked the junction system and how you could get op really fast. Been great fun watching/listening in to this run.
Wanted to donate during the final fantasy run. In my top 3 favorite FF games along with 9&10. Keep up the good work and don’t give up the fight!
Perfect way to wake up in the morning! Final fantasy! Woo!
Hello from Portugal! Long time follower, first time donor, couldn't pick a better time than at Final Fantasy 8 playthrough. Alot of Nostalgia from my childwood hits with the amazing soundtrack and story. Thanks for picking it!To my long time friend "Bigodes" who's also a long time GDQ follower, i challenge you to follow my lead and also donate for this amazing cause!Keep up the amazing work guys!
AGDQ is always bittersweet because it's just before the anniversary of our friend Jon's death to cancer. Miss you big guy, gone but never forgotten.
Been really enjoying AGDQ this year and feels worthy of being the 10th anniversary! So amazed at everyone's efforts to keep up the donations and runs for such a great cause. Hope it only grows bigger from here.
FFVIII has my favorite romance in Final Fantasy: Zell and hot dogs
Awesome speed run of Final Fantasy 8, and for such a fantastic cause- go team!!
Just woke up to see my favorite runners Muttski and Luz. GL on the rest of the run crew! #SavetheHotDogs
Eyes On Me
Y’all are so incredible. Love what you do.
Such beautiful singing <3
Final Fantasy VIII speedrun? More like: TIME KOMPRESSION
Had to donate again for that stellar karaoke
Remember to wear a seatbelt while you sing and fly a spaceship kids!
Thank you for the song. It was so beautiful <3
You all earned this.... Love it! Keep up the good work!!!
I had to donate after such a treat for my ears!
You guys are gorgeous.
Donating because of that sick recorder solo. I already loved the game, but I love it even more because of you guys.
I was saving this donation for some later prizes, but that whistle solo just wrecked me. I love you guys.
Had to donate for that amazing singing and accompaniment. Had the whole office here at work listening to it and we all agree it was just simply beautiful.
Bravo! Encore!
I’ll never not love ff8, so of course I did my best to stay up all night to watch! I mean, I failed, but I tried. At least I woke up in time for Eyes On Me!
My heart goes out for those who have or are currently struggling with cancer.
That actually wasn't bad! Aside from the instrumental solo. My ears and sides both beg you to never do that again! I wonder if we could kill cancer just with that horrid whistle?
This singing was so beautiful I had to donate.
Had to donate for the incredible Eyes on Me! My 1-year old boy started dancing during the song. Great run, have been watching the whole time from Finland. Keep up the good work!
I'm crying like a baby right now
You freaking kazoo playing mad lads, just take my money, this is all I have for now but just... take it.
Amazing singing, amazing game, amazing event!
You five should be a barbershop quintet, your singing gave me literal chills. Super glad to donate for the Final Fantasy game I never got to as a kid because I didn't have a PS1!
Donating for that HILARIOUS "bad recorder" rendition of the ending FF8 song! Holy moly, thanks for the laughs!
Here's an extra $8 for upsetting all of my cats with that slide-whistle version of Eyes On Me. I have 8 of them, so it was quite an event. $1 for each.
That FF8 song was really great! How can you not donate to that?
Epic slide whistle solo! Brought a tear to my eye and blood from my ears. XD
Good song! Keep your eyes open man! You're nearly finished! My donation incentive is up to you! Greetings from Québec!
You guys are amazing, thank you guys for running FF8 this year! Let's keep kicking cancer in the taint.
Great song, great game thank you
Donating again for that sick menu improv and the epic flute solo! Like a friend once told me, "one mistake is a wrong, two mistakes is jazz".
Amazing singing, take my money!
Thank you for you're wonderful performance. A FF 8 run wouldn't be complete without you singing.
That was beautiful
How could I resist another donation after that?
That was... awesome.
Donating for the best Final Fantasy.And the best song by a group of amazing nerds!
I'm making that slide whistle solo my ring tone
Had to donate for the fabulous slide whistle
Im not crying you are crying!
That performance was magical
This donation was going to be 5 bucks for the song but became 10 with that flute solo. Love all you guys running my favorite Final Fantasy
So when can we expect a recording of Eyes on Me with slide whistle be uploaded to Spotify?
That singing has earned many donations to prevent cancer. you go, dudes!
Here's to Final Fantasy, speedrunning, preventing cancer, and your beautiful voices.
Eyes On Me slide whistle solo = the highlight of GDQ. Thanks for the treat guys!
That brought 2 tears to my eye, first at the slide whistle, then seeing the couch arm in arm singing this beautiful song and thinking of the kindness and generosity that brought everyone to this moment. Thanks everyone, keep up the good work!
Thank you guys for that beautiful quintet, that was historic. Please teach me your slide whistle skills
I had an indescribable emotion, while you where singing; somewhere between feeling at home and meeting your best friends after a long time. You whistled yourself right into my heart.
Im a 33 year old man, and I just sang the entirety of Eyes On Me with you guys in the middle of work. What an awesome speed run, and amazing cause! Let's raise some big bucks guys. HYPE!
Beautiful rendition of the song, but where's the gotta go fast version? :)
My sweet kids believe your work is GOING to defeat cancer! They want to know what you'll sing for once cancer is gone forever. Great work on this FFVIII run gents. Our "eyes are on you!"
I have been looking forward to AGDQ 2020 for a long time and especially the Final Fantasy 8 Run. As always, I wasn't disappointed. You guys are doing great. Keep it up!
Awsome singing fellas 😃👌. Cancer needs to be wiped from the planet. Keep up the great work 🥰
ENCORE! My ears have never heard such a soothing melody! I didn't know the slide whistle could be so moving! ENCORE!
Donating during my childhood game after hearing that great karaoke song with the exceptional flute solo! Thank you to the runner & couch.
This game is one of my all time favorites
I REALLY appreciate it when the runners or couch offer a concise abstract of the story and lore of the game that's being run - and this crew for FF8 is doing a phenomenal job, especially for such a long run and such a story-driven game. Thanks so much for that, I applaud.
Was surprised to still seeing this going when I got up this morning! Happy to donate while some of my favorite runners are hard at work. Grats again tojju on perfect legend!
I've previously used the Final Fantasy runs as an opportunity to catch up on sleep while missing as few runs as possible, but I'm glad I stayed up for this.
more monkey ball pls
Love the game, love you guys, it's great what you're doing! Seeing my favorite final fantasty game completed is so nostalgic, and the slide whistle is icing on the cake! Thank you so much (: God bless you all
It's always a good time when GDQ is on! Save the hot dogs.
Hey, it's me! The Star Player of the Zanarkand Abes?I know it's selfish, but this is kind of like my story, huh? Ya know how, at the end, you realize that the whole time Squall was actually...AH HA HA HA HA HA HA! Just kidding. Good luck stopping Time Compression.
We need that FF8 remake
That singing was something to wake up to, that whistle too.... So breathtaking.
Have to donate during the FFVIII run, good luck to runners, save the frames, save the animals, CRUSH CANCER!
Amazing event, donating to a great cause and hoping that the current runner can open his heart to people different to him! (He'll get it haha, inside joke)
Thank you all for the amazing run. Been here since the start and that song brought a tear to my eye. I love this community and i love this game! Keep it up all!
Love GDQ! It makes the day go by quickly! Keep up the great work!!
Here is some money to do some good, and to get the Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition up and running.
Can we talk about how they let a group of teens just keep a highly advanced dragon space and selphie learned how to fly it in a matter of minutes.
gl hf
Good morning to the runners. That was some great singing right there. Good luck on the endgame and looking forward to the Omega battle
How could I not after that sick recorder solo.
Good luck to Luzbelheim on their speedrun! FFVIII was my favorite as a baby gay. So glad to see it celebrated for a good cause. #feminism #translivesmatter #blacklivesmatter
What is the reason for not playing the newly released remaster version of FF VIII?
Super cool game, delightful singing. I had trouble not to sing along as well !Keep it up, you're being awesome!
Woke up just in time for singing. That was beautiful.
Hey guys! Wanted to donate for the first time while watching some of my favorite final fantasy runners, in between teaching classes. Teachers like video games too! Keep up the awesome work, and good luck with the rest of the run. From Ms. G and her video game club.
I don't mean to be rude, but please accept this donation.
Had to donate for one of my top favorite final fantasy games especially for that stellar singing keep it up and destroy the cancer
I've never heard such harmony than I did today during the Final Fantasy 8 run today. Their angelic voices will help to get me through the work day.
This FF8 run is the best!!The insane blindfold and now a couch singing with the game.I love it!!
Love this event. Love you guys. Amazing work you are doing for the world and I'm happy to contribute, especially for amazing speedrunning musicians
I just have to have that signed Mana collection and Rabite ball! Thank you to the runners for all you do. Also... Still not over the extra oxygen button???
We'll be in touch.
I was worried I missed this! Glad to catch it on my lunch break at work. Would be better if work was cancelled due to the blizzard outside but that's Canada for you 🤷‍♀️
#savethehotdogsSuper proud of you boys! Keep up the excellent work. You're making my day at work on 3 hours of sleep just fly by.
Awesome game ,awesome people playing . Keep up the great work.
Hi from the front row!Can we get to 600k before the end of Final Fantasy?Let's get a 5$ donation train to get there!
Love the ultra long runs on GDQ! FF8 was one of my favorite Final Fantasy's so it feels right to donate near the end of the run. Y'all are almost there!
6 year cancer survivor. Love everything you do.
Fantastic Run!
Dear slide whistle: I hate you.
This plot is some classic JRPG silliness. I am glad you can explain it.
Had to donate during the FF8 run, you guys are doing great. My dad has been cancer free for 3 years thanks to research and early detection! Thank you to all the runners and everyone else for the great work you do and raising money for a great organization!
Wait! This is the Eifel 65 Eurodance Crew from last years Final Fantasy IX run. Keep running guys, otherwise stay blue dabedidabeda. Greetings from Germany, let's kick cancers butt together
I guess I should play FF8 again now that the plot makes any sense to me.
Couldn’t help but donate after that beautiful song, making me love FFVIII even more and fighting Cancer at the same time!
Here's a donation for that time compression explanation and making me realize I never knew what FF8 was about.
Il fallait que je donne pour rendre hommage à Ariane donc voilà 50 balles. Allez les amis on se motive et on fait remonté Ariane au sommet !
I don't know what was more impressive: the insane, improvised blindfolded menu, the magnificent flute solo or the perfectly logical explanation of time compression.
I love FF8! The story still doesn't make sense to me, but I always loved the OP magic system! Keep up the good work, and appreciate the song :)
It was totally worth waking up at 4am to watch this run! I didn't miss a single minute and will stick with it until the end! Greetings from Brazil!
Nice job on that Tidus laugh. Put this toward announcer's choice.
Best FF for me. Thanks for running!
Spent countless hours on final fantasy 8 as a kid so had to donate for the game and for the good cause
Bloody Luzbeletto, love you!
[EN] New donatation, thank you again for the event. Kiss![FR] Alllez! Allez! On se réveille de la très longue run FF et on bourre l'incentive "Ariane". Bises à tout le monde!#Tempetedesang
You guys are doing Stendarr's work! This is one of my all time faves, so glad to see you all doing this, thanks so much for all that you do!
Lets get to 600,000 before FFVIII is done!
Final Fantasy 8 is one of my favorite of all time. It’s so great to see the “FF fours” run this beast of an RPG at GDQ for such a great cause. Compress time. Kill cancer.
FF8 was my first Final Fantasy game when I was a kid, it is still as amazing in 2020 as it was back then si I'd like to thank AGDQ and the runners, here's $50 to the incentive of their choice if they have any.
I'll see you on the other side....of time
I've been here all night in the front rows watching my favorite Final Fantasy getting destroyed by some of the best in the business. Let's kill Ultimecia and Ultimate Weapon and save time and space!
No comment.

Final Fantasy 8 is the black sheep of the family but i've always liked it. Good job on the run guys.
Donating to hear Sumi sing Snake Eater
Loving the FF8 run. Keep kicking cancer's butt.
Love all the positivity and good vibes, great name choice for Squall as Badger! That Terraria run was great!
Ff14 revitalized my love for mmorpgs, and my current play through of 8 is my first jrpg. Glad I didn't know how to break the game like this.
Its a snow day for me! So it’s also a nonstop GDQ marathon! Beat cancer and whatever mess of a villain is in FF8
Time Compression..... the only way to make the end of FF8 make sense. Thank you for running this great game and.......SSSSPPPPPAAAACCCCEEEEE!!!!
I missed most of this run. I have no idea what's going on, but it's clear that the best fighting style is to shoot things with a gun.
Phew, I didn't miss the FF8 run! Have fun storming the castle!
HONK
Late but just watched the Fallout runs by tomatoangus - really entertaining and great run! Fascinating to see how that community has deconstructed those games! And all for a great cause, even better! :)
Ah yes, time compression. Makes perfect sense.
alright everyone, let's mosey!
Final Fantasy VIII was my first Final Fantasy game and it makes me love the whole saga. Good luck for the last part of the run
Twenty years ago it took me all year to finish FFVIII, mainly due to my save being erased while on disk 2, twice... but it's still one of the most amazing game experiences I've had. Amazing seeing it sped through during just my work shift! TY GDQ and all involved for this amazing week!
This FF VlIII run has been amazing, thanks for this awesome community
This has been a wonderful run. Do hope everyone gets enough sleep after this long run!
Yoooo I see a Muttski on the couch!
Loving the FF8 run! I watch the RPG limit break fun you folks did while I'm on international flights, helps to distract me from the thing that I hate: flying.
HONK!
Okay so hear me out. What if we take all the cancer and compress it together and travel into the future to defeat the body of cancer?
No comment. Just money.
Is this The End for Omega weapon? #SavedTheHotdogs
Wanted to donate in memory of my aunt that we lost last year to cancer. Good luck to the runners, and let's get some hype to make this this the best gdq ever!
Can we get a 600K HYPE?!
Managed to stay awake during the entire FF VIII run, despite it starting around 2 AM for me. It's been a delight to watch and I loved the extra incentives. Well done by all!
FF 8 is an amazing technical feat on the original PlayStation.
Merci pour vos commentaires et votre don de temps pour cette bonne cause, vous êtes les meilleurs ! :D #Tempetedesang Et courage pour le reste du marathon !
Final fantasy 8 it's a wibbly wobbly timey wimey thing.
J'aime les jeux vidéo, j'aime pas le cancer. Donc je bourre les dons.Bravo aux runners mais aussi aux commentateurs et commentatrices turbo-motivés. Gardez la pêche ! #ParraPluie
Never finished Final Fantasy VIII because of a read error on disk 3. Thanks for showing me how it ends.
Hey all, Hax0rjax here. Here's to a great 2020, and this goes to Zelda glitch fest. I will donate an extra $50 if the announcer reads this and makes everyone lost the game.
Refrained from a McDonalds breakfast this morning and instead putting that money toward supporting an incredible Final Fantasy run!
Let's get to $600,000 before the the end of FF8!!
 (Comment rejected)
What a run! Blind menuing, singing and slide whistles, and super unbelievably amazingly powerful sorceresses! Thanks to the runners!
Time to kick Ultimecia's butt! Keep up the AMAZING work!
Greetings from Europe here,Sadly couldn't watch the run live due to work, but will definitely watch the VoD later. I just have to watch the singing passage everyone is talking about! :)Great Job everyone and thank you for making the GDQ!
I never wanted to dive into Final Fantasy because I thought it would take too long. Now that I know it only takes 9 hours, I'm in!
A bonus 5 bucks for correctly pronouncing my username 'dave' instead of 'dav' on the first try!
What a fabulous run! Keep up the great work!
Had to donate during one of my favorite Final Fantasy's and for that sweat whistle solo.
hola, solo decir que he visto este evento desde el año pasado y espero que siga creciendo, me parece una gran causa. saludos a todos los comentaristas de SRE que hacen posible la retransmisión, e igual a los que no se lleguen a ver.
Just beat FF8 myself for the first time which is making watching this run even more fun! Thanks so much to all the runners and staff for this great event that I look forward to every year.
Greetings from Finland and thank you very much for the Eyes on Me performance. You guys in a boy band? Final Fantasy VIII might not be my favourite game in the series, but ironically this is the first FF run I've ever watched from the beginning to the end - started to watch AGDQ in 2011. Thank you very much for this great event, I wish I'd have more to donate, but my SeeD level is too low. Cancer? Whatever!
The upside to being sick is staying home and being up most of the night to watch this run! Remember what mufassa said: Remember who you are! Keep up the great work and can we get one last SPAAAACE from the crowd?! Give my donation to the Final Fantasy IX Runner's choice
 (Comment rejected)
Allez, on peux battre Arbys encore une fois et faire honneur a Ariane, icone de notre jeunesse ... tout du moins a nous les vieux !#DarkMage
Had to donate during Final Fantasy 8. I loved playing this game as a kid.
Amazing run thank you!Just had to donate again!Thanks for everything you do!YOU'RE BREATHTAKING!
This GDQ is seriously lacking in Animorphs, let's get that incentive met!
That Final fantasy 8 run was awsome ! Thanks for the great plot explanation ! :)
Thanks for not saying “...whatever” to cancer & working towards a brighter future 💖
SAAAAAY-GUHHHHH
My son loves watching these events and told why you do them. I am glad to support your efforts.
Great Final Fantasy 8 run!
Go Wins and Peaches! Great to see some SEGA at GDQ!
HELLO
Thanks GDQ for making work bearable! Donating to hear that wonderful, sublime rendition of Snake Eater again.
The FF8 run was amazing!!! There was so much preparation and thought and was so entertaining. Thank you runners. Put my donation toward Sumi singing Snake Eater!!
hi there your not so friendly Goose here i seem to have missed my train, how about we start a $5 donation train,if everyone watching does we'll smash that one mill mark!!!
These are some good times compressed into one week.
Go Ariane !
I love how inclusive the speedrunning community is to trans people like me.FF8 is the best Final Fantasy.My head cannon is that Squall is a butch trans woman.#TransRights<3 Lizstar
SEGA!
Great work as always. Big thanks to everyone that makes this event possible. ORB!
Love GDQ and love Final Fantasy. Six is my favorite, but I'll donate for eight too!
I will donate an additional $75 if the runner gives us his best impression of Vectorman saying, "Gone Daddy gone."
The Awful…I mean Good games block is my favourite block of the marathon, and some CGA Mega Man can only make it better…right?
Had a great time watching the Final Fantasy 8 run! Absolutely can't wait for the Awful Games block; it's the highlight of every GDQ event for me. But fortunately I have some more good games to tide me over until that time.
First GDQ I have seen live since 2016, Happy to be here, and vectorman 1 and 2 was my favorite game as a kid. Much love to the GDQ staff and volunteers who make this great event possible.
Genesis Block Does!!!
I lost my grandfather to cancer when I was a child. I'm now in my 30s and still miss him terribly. I managed to catch most of the FF8 run and loved it. Thank you all for what you do.
I slept through most of the FF8 run, but the bits I did manage to catch have motivated me to pick the game back up again. In my now 15 year old file, I'm saved in front of Ultimecia's castle with all of the Guardian Forces and Ultimate Weapons. Thanks for the great run and wish me luck!
Good luck!
Kweh
Petition to rename Vectorman to Orbman
Loving this Vectorman 2 Speedrun, I lost my Aunt to Cancer this past year, so what better to do than donate during my favorite game. Tell Cancer to recycle or die!
Donating for the opportunity to see the best game ever created: Animorphs. What? I'm being completely serious.
Vectorman was one of my favorite games as a kid. Always great to see it ran. Good luck to Winslinator and all the rest of the runners!
Thank you for the amazing work, keep it up !
Greetings from the UK. Always great to see gamers coming together for a great cause. Good luck to all the runners, save the frames and kick cancer's ass.
Bonne année à tous, GG pour ce que vous faites, et à cette super commu ! Battons-nous contre cette saleté. Des bisous et bon courage pour la suite, (j'essaye de regarder aussi au boulot, mais c'est pas évident ^^') Et vive Ariane! (musique de DBZ en tête) #DarkMage
The extra life counters in Vectorman 2 look like the people dancing in the front row! You are all awesome - keep the hype alive!
Good luck with your run, Cypherin! Put this donation towards Upgrading to Ultimate Difficulty for Marvel's Spider-Man. It's SWING TIME!
Had to donate during Vertorman when Winslinator said he was struggling because there wasn't enough lag.And, of course, HONK!
Don't mind me, just throwing more cash for the cause. Keep on speedin', and keep on glitchin'.
Second don pour bourrer Ariane ! Bisous à tous #mariolight
Shoutout to the 2 people in the front row dancing all the time everytime i check the stream.
Loved GDQ for years! When I saw my favorite game, Shadow Dancer, was on the schedule, I had to donate!
Cypherin is such a hunk - Hubba Hubba
Wanted to vote just to make the silver dude ahead for blazing chrome. Not played it but it sounds interesting and besides, it is for cancer research!
Gotta love me some Animorphs. Keep up the fantastic work for charity and speedrunning! Cancer's bad, let's help get rid of it.
Love everything you guys do. Great cause, great games, great people and great talent!
It has to happen. Let's hope we can finish it this time.
Had to donate for the snake eater song looking forward to that good luck to all the runners and greetings from Denmark
Animorphs: because terrible games are good
***COMMENT FOR SHADOW DANCER RUN*** Hey Cypher! Sorry for not being able to be on the couch for your run. I had to go home and be a family man. May Wall Grover & the Wheel of Hate be merciful on your run. Best of luck! :)
Getting on the $50 train. Also, Nintendoes what Genesisn't.
Cypherin is one of my favourite streamers and I have been looking forward to his run of Shadow Dancer at AGDQ. Good luck with the run and make that doggo dance.
A song about eating snakes and a game involving snakes. Sounds like a good combination.
Lizstar's conducting the $50 donation train, chooooo chooooo, all aboard! Looking forward to another day of great runs, good luck to cypherin
Toujours un plaisir de suivre cet événement avec LeFrenchrestream. Bourrez Les Dons #LonaLink

My mother survived lymphoma for 18 years thanks to some awesome American cancer research. Here is me giving some love back as my first donation for this amazing community. Love from Spain!
You're the best! Thugs always trying to ruin your dog walks. <3
AGDQ is always a great antidote for the stresses of life. Keep up the fight against cancer!Choo choo!
Allez, on fait décoller Ariane ! Go, Go Go !#CoeurBleu

Pour Ariane ! #ConseilDes4
go ninja go ninja go
<3 Cypherin <3
Good luck on the run Cypherin. Thank you for being such an amazing friend to everyone around you, and providing emotional support to anyone who needs it. You and the rest of the Sega crew have been so supportive of me, and I couldn't ask for better friends.
Thank you guys for making this week awesome!
Guil from Brazil here! First time donating. Had this game when I was a kid but unfortunately lent this game for a kid in school and he lost it before I could play till the end. Managed to play on ROM may years later, making it one of my top 10 games in life! And yes! thanks magazines back in the day (I hugged the left wall on the bonus stage as well!). Since my mother kick a cancer in the butt around the same time, this run and this donation are very special (if you have cancer, you can kick it in the butt too!).
Can you pet the dog? Either way, great to see Shinobi here at GDQ.
Mon don du mardi que je n'ai pas pu faire mardi. Alors je le fais maintenant.#zhtDoom
It has to be asked: Can You Pet The Dog?
Please put this towards the SMB incentive. Before my mom passed away from Cancer our entire family would play Super Monkey Ball together. I got to watch the run last year, but sadly I'll be at work for this year's run. So here's to the game that gave me many fond memories and the runners who blow my mind with what they can do. AGDQ HYPE!!!
I gotta donate for that dog in Shadow Dancer. What a good boy!
Mon don du mercredi, qui arrive bien mercredi celui-là. Allez Ariane.#DarkMage
Hello Cypherin
[SRE] A pesar de tampoco ir sobrada de dinero, queria apoyar a la causa con mi granito de arena, en nombre de mi abuela por desgracia difunta por el cancer.Gracias a GDQ, los runners y también a SRE por ocupar su tiempo en una buena causa como esta
Had to donate for the Super Monkey Ball Master Run incentive! I just go bananas for all that monkey business.
Donating for some Animorphs! Hope all you speed friends out there are having a good time!
Cancer sucks. Love seeing all the runs during the week, and love donating to help beat cancer the way the runners beat these games: as quickly as possible.
Greetings from Denmark, here's 10 dollars to take down the evil ninja empire and cancer.
Wanted to donate during my man Faust's run. Good luck man and this go to his choice
Donate for DQ Slime poster - loving this year's AGDQ!!

nintendoes what genesisn'talso Lizstar is the best commentator
Long time GDQ Vod watcher, first time donater. This goes out to the good streamer MarcyAugust and their first time attending! Here's to many more years of beating cancer!
Greetings to EngineWarZ.de
I missed FF8, but ....whatever..
Awesome to see Shinobi III Kunailess come this far. Come join the discord, we are all friendly and love shinobi! Great event since almost everyone has been touched by cancer in some form for a great cause and hope to see more!
Did I hear Liz say Goblin Superpowers? What are they? LizgodMischief
Unfortunately can't catch as much of the stream as I'd like to due to work, but happy to see games I didn't know existed.
Greetings from switzerland
Bisous à tous et petit message pour le cancer: On sait où t'habite, on arrive ! #CoeurNoir
Whatup Kaiu! Hope you guys go FULL FORCE on this game. Oh and let's grab that beer when you get back!
Just bought Shinobi III at Magfest. Gotta watch this to study for my playthrough.
What's up, Faust! Your favorite dolphin boy wishing you good ninja-ing. Doro doro dororon, shuri shuri shuriken

Genesis dintendenesis what Nintendenesis donesis
My boyfriend and I have been watching gdq for a few years now! Thanks for such a great event.
The Super Monkey Ball runs are always my favorite part of GDQ--nothing but pure skill and optimization! Here goes to getting that Bonus Master 1-skip run (as well as a little Aiai love).
#DarkMage Une grande qui mérite un don
Sumi singing is always worth supporting!
I love GDQ's spirit of jolly cooperation and I love the causes it supports. Saving-the-world-one-speedrun-at-a-time HYPE!
Had to donate during the Genesis block, one that's full of so many amazing action games! Keep up the great work, & can I get a "SE-GA" from the audience?
Good luck with these hardcore ninjutsu moves!
Greetings from Scotland! Here's $30 to hear Sumi sing Snake Eater!
<3
I just need to to show some support for my dude Faust, Cypherin and Sonicman. Faust told me to submit my times for bonks adventure and got me into actually speed running myself, on that note make sure everyone checks out greatjhons bonks adventure run on Saturday, much from the EGL community
Crazy talented runners at GDQ, thank you to all the runners and everyone who makes GDQ happen, amazing to watch.
So many hours spent playing this game, some of the best music of the generation.
This is my favorite genesis game. Love the graphic and the epic music.
You did it Faust! You snuck in expert kunailess in there like a true Shinobi. I'm proud to have made this category the norm. Now do the community proud Faust!
Been watching for years. The first GDQ I saw I started watching and suddenly it was 4 am so I've been trying to catch it since. Putting this towards the Snake Eater incentive!
Hi everyoneAs a Megadrive and GDQ fan I couldn't resist to donate once again for this amazing cause. Good luck to all the runners and greetings from Spain.
Really enjoying this year agdq, great job to all runners and who make it possible
Thanks GDQ for making my day home sick from work a little better. Good luck to all the runners and let's save those frames
Loving all this amazing Shinobi action! Great job by Cypherin and Faust on these runs!!!
Nothing beats watching gdq on my birthday with my favorite goblin hosting. Let’s blast this process
I'm a simple guy. I see Faust and the rest of the Sega Crew on my screen, I donate. SEGA HYPE!
Bonjour de la maladie, une bonne excuse pour resté au chaud a regarder l'AGDQ! #Goupix
600k HYPE
Thanks for the great run in my favorite category, shoutouts to the Discord and Shin Boney 3
Just hit 600k! Here is towards the next 600. Also the couch's positivity is worth every penny. Keep up the good work guys!!!
Gaming to cure cancer! Awesome idea! Let's do it!
Keep it up man!

[FR] #MarioLightUne petite pensée pour mon papa qui poursuit ses séances de chimio hebdomadaires.N'oubliez pas, bourrez-vous et hydratez les dons. Bonne GDQ à tous.
The sofa-choir during Eyes on Me in FFVIII-run elevated me to another plane of existence. As a thank you, here's some money to charity.
Love what you do! Keep it up!
The only thing better than Super Monkey Ball is more Super Monkey Ball! Here’s a few bananas towards the Master Run incentive!
Having 2 family members beat cancer in my lifetime, I have hope that we can one day be able to prevent this awful disease from hurting more people and their families. Keep up the great work and GL to all the runners!
Good luck runners! This is always a great event for a great cause! Also, Hi Mike! You gotta eat the lettuce!
Love you all! Thanks again for this event!
Been working from home this week so I can watch in the background! Keep on being groovy! Donating for Bonus Game 3, because we need more GDQ!
Gotta get my entry in for that Final Fantasy prize pack!
Great event, great games and great runs! Been watching for a few years already and each time I am just as excited. Good luck to the runners and keep up the good work!
I don't normally follow GDQ live, and I have never donated, but this time I'm following it because my boy dosboxfalco is running! Win that race!

Saw that Chocobo plush and I had to donate!As someone who's grandmother was recently diagnosed with cancer- luckily early enough to receive treatment- I'm glad the Prevent Cancer Foundation exists. Let's get started on hitting 700k!Let's also see this Animorphs run!
Love GDQ every time I watch. Have to donate every year. Keep up the amazing work, especially people behind the scenes keeping the stream up, keeping the consoles and PCs running, the sounds team and the event coordinators. Big love to everyone!
Hello from the audience! First time attending a GDQ and it has been an amazing experience! We are already planning next year. We have lost many close family members to cancer including my mother 7 years ago and this event for this amazing cause. Thank you to everyone that makes this event possible and good luck to all of the runners
Thank you all for all the hard work you do. I've been watching since the very first AGDQ, and am constantly blown away by the quality of content and all of the money raised for such an amazing cause. I gotta see the Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition.
On en est presque à la moitié, on tient le bon bout! Au passage pour ceux qui ont suivi la run, à la fin Squall récupère sa bague et vécu heureux! #DarkMage
Hey GDQ! I want to give a shout-out to my husband who was lucky enough to get the week off. He introduce me to this event 6 years and we haven't missed one since. I'm so glad to have met him all those years ago at a panel at PAX. Love you handsome!
I love watching you guys and gals having fun there and at home, keep it up and keep it fun ^^
Last minute donation to get in for some sweet prizes
From England. Good luck to all the runners.

Had to donate to show some love to one of my favorite series, GnG, and to two of its awesome runners Aquas and Dosbox! GL you two! Also I will donate another $20 if one of you try the big skip on Stage 4.
600K Hypoe! We're doing awesome! Hit every incentive, raise every poll, and keep that do-re-mi coming in for an awesome cause!
I did my PhD in cancer genomics, but now I develop AI for kitchen appliances. For compensation I just had to donate...
Lost my Dad to cancer in 2018. Keep running, and stomp cancer!
Love GDQ and what you fine folks do, lost my Grandfather many years ago to lung cancer and I remmebr that time vividly, anyone spared that fate would make the world a much better place, much love y'all.
I've been watching GDQ for the past 2 years. It's amazing what can be done by a community that's been brought together by gaming. Keep it up and let's kick cancer in the butt.
[FR] Bourrons les dons dans la bonne humeur et pour la bonne cause ! #Tempetedesang
Between Shinobi and Mystic Defender, I am now convinced that every Sega Genesis hero is a magic man named Joe. Your move, Nintendo.
Hey AGDQ. Thanks for another great event and happy 10th anniversary. My wife and I welcomed a new baby girl to our family on Monday and when we have a few minutes of downtime it's been nice to catch some runs. Just wanted to give a shout out all of the runners, the hosts, and everyone behind the scenes for putting on a fantastic event.
HONK!
So hype to see Helix run Super Monkey Ball at GDQ! Here's $20 to run as best monkey GonGon! Good luck and go fast!

First time donating, but long time watcher. Forget about that though, I want to see a continuing of the suffering I saw from Animorphs in 2016. MWAHAHAHA!
After 4 years of watching gdq videos on youtube, I finally managed to watch it live this year, and was able to donate too! Keep up the good work guys!
Hey, GDQ! Even though I haven't been able to attend an event since running in AGDQ 2013, it's still amazing how many friends I've gained through being in the speedrunning community. People like Dragondarch, kariohki, and SirVG have helped me through so many tough times, and I wouldn't be around probably if not for their help and others. I wouldn't even have met the loves of my life, my partners, without this community. I really hope to get back and see everyone! Maybe at Limit Break? There's no greater use for our talents than running for charity, and it's with the support of everyone around us - our communities, the viewers, the runners, the staff, our friends and family - that we can beat cancer. Good luck with all the runs this week and let's go to the limit and beat the donation total! Love you all!
Greetings from Germany, and thank you all for making the first week of uni after christmas bearable. Shoutouts to all the hosts, as I know how taxing talking for so long is for your voices, cheers!

Had to donate during my pal, Janglestorm's run! Best of luck and of course... I "cat" let this donation be "Nermal". I am not "g-Odie-ng" the Jerk Chickens into a frenzy, as I'm sure they "en-John" these puns. The Sushi Bar is cheering for you! One last thing.... If you're going through Catsablanca and you pick up Cherry Bubble gum, you're playing the wrong game!
Je suis complètement fatigué mais qu'est ce que c'est bon de suivre ce marathon en votre compagnie. #MarioLight
Hey Jangle... Caw. We are so proud you're running Garfield right now. BSG and the Bamboo Bois are watching! :)
Garfield Caught In the Act was a great part of my childhood and I'm absolutely overjoyed that it made to GDQ! Shoutout to my brother who we played this together and made a lot of memories and also, a big shoutout to my best friend, Shad for showing me GDQ and made it a major part of my life! Sending out all the love from Hungary!
Lasagnaaaaa
cats can have little a lasagna, as a treat.
Love the stream so far! Good job to all the runners.
I need that glitch exhibition in my life. More glitches are always more better!
Big ups for my lil' brother, ThePoloKing. Proud of you, I'll see you this summer.
Fighting cancer is a good cause, fighting lame and forced memes is a good cause. Here's to banjo for OOT NSR.
Had to donate again to support my fellow Westican, Janglestorm. Best of luck with the run, and INGAWA!
gotta have my lasaga
Watching you fight cancer with lasagna, we're so proud of you! Love from JangleStorm's family. (honk)
Hey Janglestorm,After so many GDQs of bad Garfield games, I'm happy that you're showcasing an arguably, sort of good one. Good luck on the run!
Shut-up and take my money
Get the powerup! Win the game!
Happy to donate to a great cause and during the run of my favorite fat orange cat!
Go Yangle Go!

Bourrez les dons et merci à tous le taff pour les commentaires et l'ambiance :D
I have been so STOKED for the debut of Garfield: Caught in the Act! This has been one of my favorite games since childhood. Was also stuck on the first level for the longest time until I figured it out by accident. Loved the soundtrack too! Best of luck to Janglestorm!
I can't believe Garfield: Caught in the Act is in an AGDQ! I played this game a lot as a kid, and it's great to see it being broken apart. Since there's no lasagne incentive, put my donation towards the Super Monkey Ball bonus run.
i played this game as a child for some reason! i think it gave me a nightmare more than once? good luck on the run!
I bought a new sealed copy of Garfield: Caught in the Act for Genesis at a Caldor's a few years after the game came out. Did you know it came bundled with a Fruit Rollup inside? It was still good. The game, not so much, but man did it look good.
AGDQ has been incredible again this year as always! May RNG blessings be upon all the runners and huge thanks to all the runners, commentators, hosts, tech staff, and audience members for crushing it with awesomeness.Can I get a BEAT CANCER HYPE?
Love the work you guys do! Keep it up!
I hate Mondays, but I love Wednesdays at GDQ!
I don't know how much lasagna usually costs, but this should cover at least one, right Jangles?
Merci a vous pour vos commentaires toujours au top !Bon courage pour ce marathon ! Des bisous ! Gg pour le taff de qualité chaque année !Et oubliez pas de bourrer Ariane ! #LonaLink

Hi AGDQ! Long time viewer, first time donator. My Fiance's mother battled cancer 10 years ago and won, on this Christmas week, we found out that the cancer wasn't done with her yet. Luckily everything was caught early and she is scheduled to have her Mastectomy next Friday! Thank you PCF and GDQ for all you have done and stand for!
Get yourself some lasagna after this run, Jangle. You've earned it.
Glitches....
The puns have been Odie-ous. Nermal-ly I wouldn't Jon in on this, but it's GDQ so hey, why not Garf or it?

Personally not a fan of speedruns, but the cause alone is enough to help. May the still upcomming runners enjoy breaking their games in the name of a good preventing cancer.
Looking forward to ZFG's run, and the OOT Glitch Exhibition!

Roses are redShoutouts to fir_Yah, hoohoo, yippeeEHH URR
Greating from Hamburg Germany, i´ve been watching AGDQ for yrs now. It´s allways a pleasure to see all off the runners and staff set up such an amazing event. Everyone participating have to be thanked for giving the most precious thing...hope. Hope shouldn´t be a privilige, but as everyone knows there are people all around who lack exactly that. It´s great to see everyone who´s in this try to give exactly that back to all people who have lost it. Keep up the great work and save those frames.Incentive goes to runners choice.
You too can be a nice guy.//ONLY MENTION IF STILL PLAYING "CONTRA:HARD CORPS"//
Love from Chile, almost 6 years seeing GDQ and helping , can you guys say "Karol Dance degenerado ql", keep this good as always!
From the next generation of speedrunners - Nothing better than watching AGDQ on the couch as a family!
hey fir! congrats on your first time announcing at GDQ! let's keep raising money and hit that 1 million by tonight. :)
Vous êtes vraiment super géniaux !!#LonaLink
Dance dad hype!
Hi Fir!
I only really regret having a job twice a year: during the GDQs. Currently watching the Bayonetta 2 vod to try to catch up. Good luck with all the runs.
This donation for Prolix's win in the charity poker tournament.
We STILL haven't met the Master 1-Skip run for Super Monkey Ball??? What are we waiting for, it's only 2 games away!!
I'm a little late to the party on this one, but did you see that blindfolded co-op run of Mike Tyson's Punch-Out?? That was so impressive that it made me hate cancer even more than I already did. I have to donate more to the cause. Good luck to the runners to come! I'll be watching.
I'm so excited for the Super Monkey Ball run! This donation is for my Grandpa who died in 2009 from lung cancer.
For Fir calling out the donations. Can you do your best Mario impression?
Let's get that Master 1-skip run for Super Monkey Ball before it's too late!
All aboard the donation train!
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA Australia is on fire, but games done quick is on! First time donating! Love you all!
Games Done Quick is a highlight of my year, and watching with my wonderful husband (hi Sam!) has been a favorite tradition of ours for five years now. We'll be staying up way past our bedtime tonight for the glory that is awful games, hopefully including Animorphs! Make it happen, y'all!
This has to be the best GDQ yet! It has some of my all-time favorite games such as ff8, Ocarina of time and MGS3: snake eater. Wanna throw out big props to thepoloking representing the great white north; here's hoping he smashes his record in blazing chrome!Oh and uh I guess obligatory honk.
long time donator, first time watcher, i like it when the pixels stay in similar positions for a long time
I'm home sick from work 10 dollar honk hype train time. Hoooonk
HEY, and I cannot stress this enough, BRO!Blazing Chrome is one of the best games I've played in the last few years, and ThePoloKing has taken this amazing game to another level. Good luck on the run, all of us in the Blazing Chrome Discord are cheering you on!!#wombocombo
So I just type whatever into this box and they guy is gonna read it out loud?
I lost my mother-in-law to breast cancer in October 2019. She won her fight against breast cancer 25 years ago, only to fall when it showed up for a second round in 2017. It was a tough fight, and we are still in the midst of mourning her loss. Even now, we're taking care of my father-in-law as he's battling advanced kidney cancer right now. Both are in their early 60s, and I wonder what could have been done if we discovered their respective cancers sooner than when we found them. Here's a donation in their honor.
Honk Honk from Sweden
Donating for that Ocarina showcase. Let's get that incentive.
Have been following GDQ all week, and it is awesome. Greetings from Denmark.
Gotta donate for AiAi
Donating to see the Ocarina glitch demo. With how glitchy that game can be, will it just be a regular walkthrough?
Props to front row dancers, keep the hype going.
Animorphs and Keiz? No question. Lets go!
Dear Runners Greetings from Germany Love to all <3
HEY BRO! When this speedrun community started last year who would have thought that we would have someone showing the game off with such amazing skill as you are. The community is so proud of you for getting the game into GDQ and hopefully you can get that World Record that you are looking for. My grandma passed away from breast cancer 3 years ago and my grandpa now has it in his neck so having this game at AGDQ is a blessing because not only do I get to donate to an amazing cause but also for an amazing Blazing Chrome runner. Also shoutout to TMR on the couch. #WomboCombo
nice
Oh Hi Fir! I almost forgot you were hosting. I keep gdq in my pocket and listen at work. It's a great week! Donation to announcers choice. <3
Keep up the good work guys! Also I can't be the only one from Romania around ..come on guys!
You must construct additional pylons.
Là on est bien ! #CoeurNoir
There's a baby monkey.
HEY BRO! Glad to have you repping that ninja swag onstage at GDQ! Hope your run goes well! And remember, MAKE IT QUICK! #wombocombo

Let's go to kick cancer ! Don't wait for Monkey ball run to see so much skill ! HONK
If we don't play Animorphs the yeerks will win. I'm doing my part.
Haha, hey bro! Good luck with the run! To quote a certain commander: "Make it quick!"
i'm baby
Been watching for the last 4 years now. Lost my Grandfather in 2015 to Bowl cancer and was told yesterday a very close family member has bowl cancer too. Bowl cancer has already taken 5 of my family members.It's not much but hopefully with combined efforts cancer won't take anyone we love from us ever again.I miss you Grandad. You were my best friend <3Dono towards announcers incentive of choice
i frames!!
I can't think of anything funny or sweet to say, so I'm just gonna remind everyone: stay hydrated, or a rambunctious goose may come and ruin your run.
Good luck with the run, Hello to everyone else watching inside VRChat
Hello from Quebec, Canada! I barely understand anything that is going on in these speedruns yet the energy of the crowd and the runners is amazing! Great job to everyone involved! HONK!
Hey ADGQ, Internet Explorer here, I just wanted to donate for this awesome run! What's this game called? Blazing..... oh... oh I see how it is...
had to donate during the epic BLAZING CHROME!!! sending brazilian kisses to all in the event xoxo!
Long time watcher, first time donator. So glad to finally be able to contribute to such a good cause!
Awesome job everyone is doing at GDQ 2020, since 2014 I have not missed a single one. This is my first time donating so HONK!
This game came out in 2019?! I almost don't believe, it perfectly captures the feel of a 90s shooter.
If only Contra Rogue Corps was this good :'(
@ThePoloKingFirst time watching somebody I know Speedrun a game for GDQ. Good luck in your run, and I hope you get the World Record you are looking for! From your buddy Nick all the way back from Nova Scotia!
Keep up the good work everyone.
Bravo là l' AGDQ et au french restream pour nous faire vivre. Bourrons les dons contre le cancer
L'AGDQ 2020 en trois actes : Partir travailler quand la run de FFVIII commence et revenir quand elle finit (à une vache près), se dire que finalement pas besoin de jour de repos vu qu'on rate un seul jeu. Regarder le planning du jeudi : se rendre compte qu'on va en rater 16. Prévoir un jour de congé pour regarder toutes les VOD. #GDQup
Pour l'un de nos streameur qui s'entrainne presque tous les jours pour le randomizer d'Ocarina Of Time. (on devrais le dire en criant mais on va respecter le public :D ) #LonaLink #Kyogre #GoupixFor one of our streamers who trains almost every day for the Ocarina Of Time randomizer. (we should say it by shouting but we will respect the public: D)
Suh dude
Remember people, stay Honk-drated!
No Comment
My father is having cancer in his liver,lungs and everywhere between. Now his liver has started failing and I wish no one this fate. You are doing a great job and wonderful speedruns!!! Keep up the good work for the years to come! Cheers
Donating for those sweet, sweet Canadian pronunciations. If you have a problem with Canada gooses, you've got a problem with me. And I suggest you let that one marinate.
Not much to say but I had to get this donation in while Fir underscore is announcing. LikeYeehaw.
Just met Poloking here at my first GDQ! Good luck on this run, looks like I have a new speedgame to check out soon! Also, HONK!
long time watcher, first time donating, greeting from germany, cancer screens are the worst, screw the specs GDQ keeps me going
Love these Marathons every year, and a worthy cause.
Love AGDQ! If we can get 250 people to donate $10, we will hit the incentive for Super Monkey Ball! Let's get this donation train out of the station! Do it for the monkeys!
5 dollar train for fighting on a train. honk! Lets go animorphs
Nintendoes what genesisn't
Great to see a runner we know from home! Tuning in from Nova Scotia. Me and my husband have been watching for a long time but this is our first time donating. Go polo king!
Hey AGDQ,I love your events and donations every year. But this year my donation is a little bit smaller because I also donate for Australia because of the terrible fires there. Therefore I have to say: Save the animals!
This July, my wife had to have her entire kidney cut out to save her life from cancer. I'm so thankful we had the knowledge and technology available to save her, because it allowed us to have our wedding that following October.PCF helps make stories like mine keep happening, I am happy to give back to the cause that saved her life. Keep crushing games, and crushing cancer while you do it.
Big props to my homie PoloKing killin' this run! Donating and watching all the way from China! Love ya bud
Shout out to Dominic Ninmark, the composer on Blazing chrome and a good friend of mine.
Been watching for years but first time here live! GDQ is such an awesome cause! Good luck to all the runners! :D
First time donating. Greetings from Spain!
I've been a long time GDQ watcher, and I look forward to the events every year. Thanks to all the amazing people who make the events happen and everyone in the speedrun community. A dear friend of mine was diagnosed with leukemia at the end of 2019. He is on the long road to recovery, but let's make sure no one else every has to go through what he has.
Vous êtes tous très beaux ( sauf Ridlaids viens te batté si t'es pas content ) sus au cancer plus petit que 3
Last year I was diagnosed with something called Lynch Syndrome. Lynch Syndrome is a gene mutation that is passed along through families and it raises the likelihood of a person who is diagnosed with it getting cancer the older they get. For example, the risk of getting bowel cancer with Lynch goes up to 80%. My dad passed away from cancer along with two of his brothers and his mum/my grandma. All of them also had Lynch Syndrome. Thanks to being diagnosed I can now be under careful watch for the rest of my life to prevent cancer from taking me too soon. Donating to a cause that helps to prevent cancer can make a difference to so many people, but I also want to add that watching speed runs has helped me tremendously too, particularly Zelda runs. On that note, here’s a shout out to Zfg for probably taking most of my speed run watching hours, seriously looking forward to the OoT run. Good luck to all of those left to run and please, if you have a history of specific type of cancers running in your family, do consider genetic testing for preventative purposes! You could save lives.
#FR Le cancer est un sacré speedrunner, détecté en juillet nous avons enterré un parent hier. #GottaGoQuick
Let's see the Super Money Ball Bonus Run, but first let's see the dancing folks in the front do The Wave!
Premier don, il le fallait car j'ai une dent contre le cancer ! J'ai échappé à une leucémie (cancer du sang) à l'âge de 2 ans, je ne peux pas m'en souvenir mais j'en garde aujourd'hui encore quelques séquelles, mineures heureusement. Une chance que certains n'ont pas eu, des proches, de la famille, dont mon petit cousin, touché lui aussi par une leucémie, et parti il y a quelques années, à l'âge de 13 ans...J'espère vivre assez vieux pour voir ce fléau disparaître, mais ça ne veut pas dire que je souhaite la fin de l'AGDQ ! 10 ans déjà, est-ce que ça peut encore continuer 50, 60 ans ? voire plus allez <3Gardez la pêche ! #GDQup parce que le petit déj, c'est sacré ! (Rein à voir avec les pêches, les oranges à la limite)
Here you go !
Animorphs? Sign me up for these Animemes!
I lost my singing teacher to cancer last year, so I know how important the work PCF and other charities do is.
 (Comment rejected)
I’m so excited to finally be in the audience! Good luck to all the runners and hi Charlie! Love, mommy
Watching GDQ with my sister and it’s her first time ever seeing. If there’s one thing we’re both cited for it’s MONKEYBALL
For Zach
This is for all the amazing work! I have been a watcher for 6 years and never had a chance to donate until now! good luck on all the runs <3
Been watching GDQ since 2011, here's to another decade! Shoutouts to Formality on Proudmoore and the Round 1 SCM crew.
HONK HONK HONK...HONK HONK..HONK....honk.
Had to come support my new friend Elpis who I met a couple hours ago gl and crush the run
To honour of my father in law who died last year from cancer. You guys do such a great job, honk to everyone.
Much love to all the staff and runners, you guys are amazing. Shout out to my guy Flibbity Flam on the couch, a legendary speedrunner in his own right and, I'm glad I"found" you. Good luck on the run Elpis. Donation goes to Flib's choice.
Thanks for putting on another amazing GDQ! I work for a Cancer Center and can definitely attest at the benefit gained from donating to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Thanks for all the amazing work by the runners and everyone involved in setting up, planning, and supporting the event.
Howdy GDQ, thanks for 10 years of solid fundraising and speedruns! Here's to kicking cancer in the bunz.
sub
My dad is currently battling stage 4 lung cancer, and has been for a year. Thank you AGDQ and all who donate.
FLIBBITY IS THE BEST FLAM! Also GLHF to all of the runners at AGDQ!
I have wonderful memories of playing video games with my grandfather before lung cancer took him from me when I was young. I still have his Playstation 1 that he left to me. My grandmother on that side was diagnosed late last year and is still undergoing treatment. This donation is for both of them, and to no more cancer.
Appreciate everything you do! Keep up the good work!
For my 3 gamersPxlgrease, navathewiseone. And macancheese3
Even I'm not a fan of cancer. I hate it so much that I want you all to donate. If you don't I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish. (Quote from 2000 movie)
Like every year, here are my 10 dollars, from Spain with love. Thank you for everything all the GDQ team do every single year. GO DANCE DAD PogChamp !
5 bucks for the train to keep it going...choo choo! from Germany with love!
Super Monkey Ball always kicked my butt as a kid so I love seeing it absolutely destroyed in speedruns! Here's to seeing even more of it after the main run.
Haaaaaay Elpis! Now, to be fair, I play Napalmless too, I just aren't NEARLY as fast as you or D4gr0n. Anywho, good luck with the run!
No better way to end the day then seeing Cybernator be destroyed in minutes.Good luck on the run and have fun Elpis.And for more games, lets get this Animorphs happen.
 (Comment rejected)
Coming straight from the ShenanaRepublic, stoked to watch some toptier animorphs gameplay and commentary.
I've played Cybernator hundreds of times and never seen it froze. Here's five dollars for the pain.
Ocarina if time is my favorite game let's see that glitch exhibition...oh and we can kick cancer's butt in the process too? That's a win win.
5$ donation train to meet the Monkey Ball incentive?
Let's get that Monkey Ball run!
Stay brave, brave people!
Thank you for another great run of AGDQ!Unfortunately I won't be able to watch my favorite videogames this year due to my schedule, but that won't stop me from donating.Good job, and I hope this year we'll reach a new record for the donation!Also, honk!
Hey, Elpis! Loved knowing you from the Xtreme 2 community and enjoying this run so much. Can’t wait for Super Monkey Ball as well, hope the game doesn’t lock again!P.S. I’m a Jake. :(
Legit yelled "nooooo" when the game froze because this is one of my favorite SNES games from my childhood. Props to GDQ for letting Elpis reset, and props to Elpis for rolling with the L3 Punches.
Hey, I'm a Jake. Jake HYPE!
Toss a coin to your AGDQO' Valley of PlentyO' Valley of Plenty, ohToss a coin to your AGDQA friend of humanity

Super monkey ball is one of my favorite games, im here to support helix and the project m community! Lets go helix!
Helix i'm baby nation but you gotta play GonGon chief
Wow! I've been watching AGDQ since Cosmo's Ocarina Of Time run in 2013. You know, the one with the wrong warp straight to the Ganon's Tower collapse sequence. Put this towards kicking cancer's butt, and more Ocarina Of Time glitches. I'm thrilled to see what the community has been up to.
Super Monkey Ball is amazing but memee is not in the lead and that's a shame.
In Super Monkey Ball, does the word 'Super' mean it's a Super Ball, or a Super Monkey? Go get 'em Helix! #LetGongonIn
Let's go Helix! Me, Tony, and the gang are wishing you luck! We're proud of you for making it to AGDQ! Let's get those last minute donations for the Master 1-Skip Run!
Gotta donate for Monkey Ball! Shout-out to the best charity event around and my best buds Evan and Tyler. Nothing better than beating cancer with video games
Elpis' run has succeeded in getting me interested. The Armored Core meets Contra vibe looks awesome. Looks like he'll just have to comeback next year for more!
Cybernator is a legit classic; hope to see Elpis back sometime in the future.
I love meemee
That hat with the floppy ears in the front row is the best hat ever.
Absolutely love monkey ball and would really like to see more of it if possible tbh.
We must HONK.
Super Monkey Ball is always one of the most impressive things to watch sooo.. lets get more.
here's a shoutout to the lovely front row dance crew with all the great hats! Let's get rid of cancer together!
I'm more or less broke, but this is all I had on paypal. Love the content guys keep up the runs and the good attitude. Much love from Sweden.

Thank you, Elpis, for your Cybernator run - even if it did not finish, I enjoyed what I saw of the run! I wish everyone at AGDQ and at home all the best for 2020.
For the run by Elpis, sorry it didn't work out. Better luck next time. <3
zelda glitch exhibition? more like.. YEAH-lda glitch exhibition!
#LetGongonInHey Helix! Make those monkys fly!It's been amazing to see you grow as a person over the years, and I'm proud to call you a friend.

My brother survived melanoma. He's the strongest person I know. Together we'll beat cancer forever!

Howdy from the audience! Super Monkey Ball is one of my favorite speedruns to watch! Knock it out of the park, Helix!!
Donating so I can see my main man GonGon be the monkey for Super Monkey Ball. Always support the big boys.
Always love catching GQD. Almost forgot about it as I've been busy getting engaged! Happy to catch the show though and always happy to donate to such a great cause.
Triste pour le runner de Cybernator :'( . Mais go Super Monkey Ball ! "D'ailleurs ce jeu est un des jeux de l'UD"2 ;) #ConseilDes4
Super Monkey Ball has been such a huge part of my childhood and I'd love to see those extra levels! Let's crush that incentive and crush cancer!

My husband was looking forward to this Super Monkey Ball stream but sadly had to work. Donating so he can hear this message when he watches the VOD later. Love you, Garrett! Donation to runners choice.
CraneSong donated $25 and said: CraneSong with the $25 donation, saying: CraneSong donates $25 and says: Animorphs? I love animals, and morphing. I bet that game is great, that's probably what the 'G' in 'GBA' stands for.
#LetGongonIn shouts out to Helix! Can't wait for you to monkey some balls, possibly faster than anyone ever! I'll donate 6 more cents next time I see you irl... Donation goes to runner's choice
Hey, Helix, Mao here. Super proud to see someone I know at GDQ! I'm sure the rest of the Project M community is cheering you on! Good luck on your run and try to avoid some memory leaks while you're going so fast, ok? #LetGongonIn

Helix, my boy! We're all so proud of you!!!
Zela, I'm leaving it up to you to make sure Helix is doing enough hand stretches. This is everything I've trained you for. Good luck! And I'm guessing 37 bananas.
Thanks to all the staff and volunteers for making an awesome event! Let's HONK cancer right in the HONK.
Had to donate during this Super Monkey Ball run. Such a hard game and these runners make it look so easy. Let’s hope that eventually we can make cancer “FALL OUT”.
HONK!
Donating during a time I can, for donation to not get read again, but fret not since I know the donation still goes through! Put this towards Runner's choice, and keep on speeding!

Hey Helix, MN Smash is here all watching you!
I was going to wait until later to donate, but watching this monkey ball run has compelled me to do so now because it's absolutely BANANAS.
Happy to donate every time GDQ comes around. Thank you for everything you do and thank you diceguyd30 for 100 gifted subs into the chat!!!
I'm donating this for my childhood friend, Jesse who is finishing up his chemo treatments for stage 3 brain cancer. Keep on rolling them monkeys!
I loved Super Monkey Ball as a kid. This is blowing my mind. Amazing! Good luck & Good job on the incentive everyone!
Hey, here's a joke for all of you.What is AiAi's favorite genre of music?The answer: Rock and ROLL.
I loved playing Super Monkey Ball on my 3DS and never got around to playing the rest of the series - seeing a runner as cool as Helix do it live at a GDQ is a great motivator to do so! Hype, and... doesn't that ball look a lot like an ORB? Eh?
Champ Cal Raid
Monkey ball was one of my fav games growing up. its soo crazy seeing someone play it like this its such a hard game. Thanks for all your hard work
Hey Helix just wanted to remind you again to pack as much warm weather as you can into your luggage when you come back! Good luck on the run dude!
Taking a break from work to watch some Super Monkey Ball! These games have always been my favorite speed runs to watch
Shoutout to Jaxler, AKA Yellow Shirt Guy for bringing the HYPE

LROCK! MIZ here. Good luck in showcasing "Josie-Skip" in all of its glory, and remember to go fast because:"Pizza dude's got 30 seconds..."
I’ve been watching from the crowd all week and this place is as electric as I’ve felt so far! Thanks Helix for being awesome and for bringing Super Monkey Ball, my launch title for GameCube from all those years ago.

Shoutout to AGDQ for the awesome content! This convention helped me to meet my 7-year long friend, BlitzArcticWolf, and his buddies, Airfly111, TheRealLeafApollo and EmceeCh4p, for the first time!

Also, shoutout to Raysfire and BrownMan for being huge inspirations for me to be a better person and a better content creator! Let's kick cancer in the CAN! :D

Always hype for Super Monkey Ball!
watching this is making me sweat
Super Monkey Ball is a blast to watch! I have watched GDQs many times, but this is the first time I can catch the live streams! I could say I'm *clears throat* bananas about this! Keep up the great work everyone!
Hey Helix, the Project M Sonic Discord is cheering you on, you RASCAL!
Merci beaucoup pour votre stream et un grand bravo aux commentateurs #IsaacLou
I wasn’t planning on this donation, but seeing the awesome trucks done during the Monkey Ball speedrun, I was compelled to donate.
I first got into GDQ by watching Super Monkey Ball, and its still my favorite game to watch. S
First time donating - loved the Super Monkey Ball segment. Thank you all for organising!
Zfg, you're among the first three people I followed on Twitch 2 years ago. You got this!
Animal crossing in 72 days

Wanted to give a quick shout-out to the Buckeye Speed Bash crew, and one more thanks to LRock for helping me get into TMNT by gifting me a copy of TMNT 4 on SNES as a kid. You've always been an amazing friend, and I'm glad to see you on the big stage one more time! Sorry I couldn't be there in person this time, but we'll get some pizza in celebration once you get back!

Can we get some Fs in the chat for cancer?
Et voilà une semaine à enchainer les siestes pour pas rater les runs voulues ! Bon courage à toute la team FR pour cette nuit et les suivantes !

Hey LRock, what does Raphael do when he hears a pun?He sighs.
That was awesome, Helix! Was rooting for you the whole time. Congrats on getting into ADGQ!
Welcome from luxembourg . Ive never gotten into speedrunning but i always love watching it , also can you put out a shoutout to Nick
I’m broke as hell but I can still spare $5 towards the Animorphs incentive. Bad games don’t die, they just get broken. Good luck to all the runners.
So happy to see a game from the Mushihimesama series at an GDQ event. Greetings from Germany.
WHERE ARE THE TUUUURTLES?!
l'incroyable AGDQ frappe encore très fort. Merci à tous, les organisateurs comme au participants et les supers commentateurs <3 #GDQup

So it's this time of GDQ again... Time for LRock to destroy yet another Arcade Beat 'Em Up. Always amazes me how such a kind, gentle guy can be so good at beating things up! Good Luck dude, much love.
My poor grandma bought me Animorphs on Game Boy Color as a child, not knowing it was... maybe not the greatest game.Good thing she also bought me Mario & Luigi later on to make up for it.Rest in peace Grandma, and good luck to all of the runners who raise so much for charity.Henshin-a-go-go, baby!!
I am extremely excited for this animorphs run!! Let's make it happen!
GDQ has to be the coolest event on the interwebz....keep up the speed!!! Cowabunga.
First time donating to this awesome event ! Good luck to all the runners for the runs to come, gotta go fast ! Lets beat cancer !
From the former 999% record holder to Lrock, awesome to see you representing the TMNT spoken run community. Let’s kick some cancer like we kick the foot clan!
Luttons contre cette maladie qui a privé une petite fille de 6 mois de son père.#TempeteDivine
Can I get a $5 train to see Keizaron play Animorphs? Missing him in the players seat this year!
Prolix you are my favorite :D
Hey LRock, it's ya boi Shawn. The Retro community and RGL gang are well behind you! You've got this, my friend!Donation going towards Animorphs because it's been funny that staff keeps stopping him from saying Animorphs, but he deserves to be in Awful Block. keizaLOL
Hey Prolix, your good friend Anonymous here. Mushihimesama futari is "Bug Princess Duo" for "two people", but in English that doesn't sound so great so Google's version sounds better.
Keep upthe good work. Really enjoying the speedruns. Shoutout to the runners & organizers. With all love from Germany!
Glorious Honk for OOT file name
Not much but want to donate to such a great cause. Lost my uncle 2 years ago to lung cancer. Keep up the amazing work guys
Long time watcher, first time donator. Although I never lost someone to cancer I'd never wish it on someone. Losing someone is the worst thing that can happen to you because every person on this planet is precious to someone. Greetings from Germany and good luck to all the runners.
Had to donate for one of my favorite arcade games of all time.Shout out to the Star Wars Collecting community! Pizza Power!
Love the Super Monkey Ball run. Cheers from Green Hills Software.
Happy to see all the good GDQ is doing and proud to see you on the stage again LRock. Turtle Power!
The heater is mine Alex Williamsons. Also LRock rocks.
First time donating, and properly not my last time. Ready to see the TMNT run
This donation is in honor of the people in the audience dancing during the breaks, including dancing hat lady. Keep on keeping on

Hello there!
I'm a long time watcher (my now-fiance got me hooked!), and I'm not a gamer! Thanks for providing hours of entertainment for a great cause. Keep up the good work (and front-row dancing)!

How have we not hit the incentive for a glitch expo in Ocarina?! Hey! Listen!! Let’s hit that $60k, everyone!
Had to send my support to one of my favorite runners, Lrock! You're one of the reasons I started speedrunning and I know you'll crush your turtles run. Good luck!
En espérant que ces dons aideront a créer des lendemains meilleurs #ConseilDes4
In german the word for cancer is the same as for crab. So keep the Donationtrain going and let us all eat more crabs.
Loving the TMNT run! Spent many of summer hours when this first came out! Great to see it destroyed!
Had to donate for my favorite and unarguably the best turtle Donatello. Have fun on the run LRock! Turtle Power!
TMNT was easily my favorite arcade game as a kid, had to donate during this run. Do what you do Lrock.
Hey Lrock, what about the NES version?
YO LROCK. TONIGHT, WE DINE ON TURTLE SOUP.Greetings from the 502!So glad to see LRock ruin yet another arcade game and bringing that trademark enthusiasm to the game!
WHY HAS ANIMORPHS NOT BEEN FUNDED YET. HELP US FIX THIS!
 (Comment rejected)
Just had to donate during LRock’s run! Good luck, kick butt, and I just know you’ll knock this run out of the park <3
"A Jose Canseco bat?? Tell me you didn't pay money for this!" Well I didn't. But I'll pay money for this donation
Ive been waiting for this run for 3 days. Shout out to Mike on the couch. He helped me fix a button on TMNT at an arcade bar I go to regularly. I cant tell you how many hours i spent playing this game as a child on the NES, and it's amazing seeing it beat so quickly. $10 more if I can get a "COWABUNGA!" from the couch.
Hey guys! Long time watcher, first time donator! I've always wanted to donate but have never had the opportunity to do it, but when I saw OoT on the list I knew I had to do it. I know it's not much, but it's what I could do. Good luck to all the Zelda runners out there. Bonus points if I can get an invitation of links grunt from the couch!
Thank for running what looks to be a exact replication of the arcade TMNT which I loved playing as a kid trying to beat with one credit. You are killing it right now in this run. Keep up the great work with this already awesome run!
So proud and happy to see so many of my fellow RGLers showing off their skills. Kick some shell, LRock!

TURTLE POWER!!!
I love them fat pugs!
Love you all, fitst time sonatine! Honk!
You are all great. Very impressed with all of the runs, and I appreciate the gaming for good. Honks and Hearts.
Hey LRock! Jaidlyn and Aehron here to wish you good luck at this stellar run. Kick cancer's butt and cowabunga dude!
Hope Shred-dude lay off his anti mutagen lightning. COWABUNGA! Great showing on this classic game!
Thank you, GDQ!!
donating during the arcade game that was my childhood. Good luck and keep up the good work.
#PokeLou
What's that? An extra credit costs money? Always happy to chip in.
Pour la recherche et LeFrenchRestream! Hip Hip Hip! ...#Tempetedesang
Never thought I'd see a genuine bullet hell game being run at GDQ! Hype for the Mushihimesama run, time for washing machines!
TMNT Arcade!
Dude! TMNT ARCADE???? It's amazing to see this on here. I'll donate fifty for the two extra credits the runner needs and anotjer 25 per death. Run well please for the sake of my wallet, otherwise, beat canver!
Arcade cabinets. The original pay to win games
Is this like Dark Souls? Dodge and poke?
When I was younger I thought the Metal Gear Solid story was real. Thanks to the GDQ staff for hosting such a wonderful event. Hoping to attend in person next year!
#Goupix
Shout out to my cousin AL who is watching the stream. He introduced me to GDC this year and I can't stop watching it! You guys are amazing, good luck to all the speedrunners, and keep up the great work.
As an avid shmup fan, this has been the run I've been looking forward to this week, Mushihimesama Futari! Dodge all those bullets and shoot down the cancer!
Hey guys, I'm donating 7.90 for the best pokemon, Slowpoke! Please put my donation to the Animorphs incentive; that's like the same thing, right?
Shout out to Sienna, best person in the world. Let’s beat cancer as fast as possible.From a volunteer watching in the room while waiting for his next shift.Honk for all the volunteers
Have watched GDQ for the past three years, and happy to be in a place to donate once again. Two years ago, my mom was diagnosed with colon cancer, but we're blessed that it's gone into remission. Here's to helping in the fight to stop cancer!Also, put this toward the Legend of Zelda OOT Glitch Exhibition!
Merci au French Restream de nous faire vivre cette semaine de dingue avec des commentateurs au top et des gens en backup au taquet ! On ne lâche rien et on continue de bourrer les dons! #IsaacLou
yo
On va bourrer le cancer comme on a bourrer les genoux de krang (run de tortue ninja). Merci pour votre taff ! Des bisous 😘 #YomiCeleste
Go full shmup, gus!
Honestly its amazing to see a TMNT destroyed nearly effortlessly. My child self could never beat a single one but that didn't mater too much because after all I loved just playing it and I believe that is what all games should be about, enjoying the run we start.
Cancer sucks so thank you all.
Hey everyone, Kaedenn here. Remember to donate to Zfg's glitch exhibition! Zfg has something special in store for all of you and you won't want to miss it! We're about halfway there and we can do this! zfgGoldOut
Super excited to see Mushihime-Sama at GDQ especially Ultra mode! The skill it takes to survive, never mind speedrun, a game like this is just incredible. Wishing gusto a great run!Next year, how about a CAVE game block? Let's get some HYPE from anyone who agrees!
play banjo >:(
Hyped for the Zelda run coming later! great GDQ as always! Thanks for all the runner and people making this event possible! Make glitch exhibition happen people!
Shoutouts to STG Weekly and Touhou. Let's beat cancer, fellas
When I first started watching GDQ I felt cancer didn't impact me directly. Since then, both my parents have survived cancer and many friends have had it. The work on early detection PCF does is invaluable to helping save and improve lives. Thanks to all!
Here, have money.
Have to add "Late night Dance Party at GDQ" to my bucket list. Loving the vibes from the GDQ dance team in the front row. Keep up the great work everyone. You make the graveyard shift so much more entertaining.
Awe, we BFF's. Let's play some bullet hecks when you get back home! Great job by everyone so far, let's get some hearts in the chat for Prolix!
bullet honk
quit your honking, I'm trying to work.
Can't wait for the Mega Man relay later, thanks again to all the runners
The Mushihime-sama series has one of my all time favorite bullet h*ck soundtracks. Never thought i'd see it in GDQ. Good luck, gusto!
Sans is harder... But not as hard as Gus!
The Best speed run, is the one where we beat cancer with WR times. 10 years of GDQ and hopefully another 10 more.
What the h*ck is an Animorphs?
I love speedruns! Glad I could donate to this amazing cause! if you can, put this towards the banjo name for ocarina of time.
I've been watching these marathons for a few years now, but today is a bunch of firsts for me. It's my first time donating, Mushihime-sama Futari is my first import for the XBOX 360, and it's my first 1cc.
So glad to see shmups represented at GDQ! Had to donate for one of my favourite games, Mushihimesama! The community for these games online is incredible, shout out to all the wonderfully helpful people always willing to help newcomers learn to dodge bullets reaaal good.
Thank you to all the runners, GDQ staff, and volunteers for putting on such an amazing event every year. I love watching the speedrunning community come together to do so much good. Let's help to get rid of cancer once and for all! HONK!
Donating in memory of my uncle who died of cancer a couple of years ago. Growing up, he was a hugely influential in fostering my love of video games. If his cancer had been discovered in time, he may very well still be with us.
I'm really looking forward to seeing ZFG run Ocarina of Time, let's get that glitch exhibition!
Good luck to the runners may RNGesus smile upon us all
GusIf you're going to tryGo all the wayGood luck with Futari Ultra 1CC
Shout out to the Pals 4 Life who enjoy the GDQ every year!
Thanks to all the awesome runners!
1CC arcade clear AND a bullet-hell shooter showcase?! How could I not donate!
 (Comment rejected)
Honk, honk, AGDQ! I had to donate for Keizaron to run Animorphs, because I love hot garbage, and I love supporting any and all awful (or secretly awesome) games. The guy next to me on the bus this morning was watching GDQ and we got into a conversation about how great the community behind this lovely event is. Thanks for being so inclusive, warm, and one of the things that makes me feel proud to call myself a gamer. xoxo
Pour luter contre cette maladie
super happy to see some Cave action on ADGQ! i've spent a lot a time in Mushihimesama, but i found it Mushihimesama too hardy. best of luck!
FR: Yo LFR ! Il était temps de faire mon premier don de la semaine mais j'étais obligé d'attendre que Chachamaxx ne soit pas à l'ambiançage car je ne veux pas qu'il lise mon don, je préfère largement la voix sensuelle de Rocher ou Muri. Débizous #KyogreEN: Hey GDQ ! Congratz for the 10th year, cancer is not dead still but we can still beat it ! Let's do this !
good luck to gus, all us sealposter are cheering you on

It's marvellous to finally see shoot 'em ups on the prime time of GDQ!! No pressure, Gusto, everyone's counting on you!
Lost my dad to cancer last month and figured I'd better donate. So why not do it during one of my favorite bullethell shmups. Break a leg Gusto!
My boy Gusto repping the Shmup Scene!!! We finally made it to AGDQ! All the shmup homies are watching and rooting for you! You got this! Larsa cannot handle Gusto going FULL SHMUP!
So happy to see Mushihimesama at GDQ. Best of luck with the run; I'm sure it'll be spectacular.Shooting game never die!
Donating so Keiz can live his best life.
#Squid Hype pour Futari !!
Au dodo pour moi, ne lâchons pas Ariane. Bonne nuit à tous ! #EniCeleste
Super excited to see one of my all-time favorites being crushed by gusto on AGDQ! Let's squash some bugs AND cancer!
Honk :)
More GDQ? Animorphs run by Keizaron? Sign me up!
First time donating. Can’t wait for MGS3. Watching as a family. Thanks for all you guys do!
Glad to see Mushihimesam being shown off at gdq, Reco will destroy those bugs and help destroy cancer! I'll donate an additional 15$ if the announcer gives me their best "Nyaaaaaaaaah~" in true Reco fashion.
Gotta see if it's actually possible for Keizaron to finish a game in the estimate time! Love ya really Keiz, but why put yourself through so much pain and misery?
STAGE 3 SONG IS A BANGER, MY DUDES!!!! WAIT FOR IT!!!
Shoutout to Shmup'Em-All and all the amazing shmup community. Good luck Gusto for the run, HONK !
Watching Gus navigate these brain-melting bullet patterns is absolutely amazing! Keep on using your eyeballs and shoot down cancer!
Bravo à tous pour ce que vous faites. En espérant qu'une pluie de dons digne des pluies de boulettes de Mushihime-Sama s'abatte sur cet AGDQ #Parra666
So cool to see a shmup superplay exhibition at GDQ for the very first time, and there is no one better suited to show off this level of play than Gus! Here's to many more in the future.
 (Comment rejected)
Yay for shmups at GDQ! Loved this game and it's amazing OST!
Wanted to see if we could get a $5 train started for this INSANE gameplay! This game is crazy hard, and you're just destroying it.
Just wanna say that if you haven’t seen the Animorphs 125% run, you’re missing a treat! Big shout out to keiz!
I love seeing high-skill games that aren’t necessarily “speedruns” at AGDQ! This is really incredible to watch. $50 to the Ocarina glitch exhibition - really want to see that!
[FR]@Aluzor#GDQup I was a student and I lost 2 parents vs cancer. Now I'm a worker and I can donate for those who can"t. Merci au French Restream de faire connaitre l'AGDQ des bisous à tous/kiss for all
My mom and aunt kicked cancer's butt back when I was in high school, and it's great you all are working to break the cancer cycle! Let's get Keizaron to Animorphing!
Sending some love from the Final Fantasy XIV community and Testaments free company guild on Cactuar. I'd like to challenge the amazing Final Fantasy XIV community and fellow warriors of darkness to donate and help us esuna cancer once and for all. Thank you to the sponsors, speed runners, commentators, and everyone who has worked to bring together such an amazing event.
Really enjoying this TASbot run of Mushihime-sama Futari!
Is this a TAS? This is the craziest run ive ever seen! Congrats Gusto!
Never thought I would donate during Mushihime-sama Futari, a game whoose name I can probably not even pronounce correctly. But here I am and can not look away. Thank you everyone for your hard work for a good cause! Stay awesome!
10 minutes into Mushihime-sama and Honk and your brain be like "what? How? WHY??!!!"
For the Glitch Exhibition!
Thank you so much!
I'm watching the Mushihime-sama Futari run and all I can think is "Espgaluda II when?"
Awesome job making it to AGDQ Gus! From me and the rest of the SHMUP community, go all the way and end the game with a bang!
Thank you for putting on an amazing event. The level of talent of the runners and the AGDQ staff is insane.
Arcade games might be some of the most wildly marathon-unsafe games out there, but this is amazing. More shmups in GDQ
This shmup witchcraft is too ridiculous not to donate during. Putting this toward Animorphs bonus. Bring on Awful Games Done Quick!
Gusto is a Ned Stark at this game, he is blowing my mind!
This is the most insane game I’ve ever seen, I actually have no words. Donation goes to runners choice. Just wow.
Bullet heck hype!
Found AGDQ about a year ago and have completely loved watching since, keep up all the good work !!!
What the bullet h'ck am I looking at? I had to donate, this is frekking amazing!
Perhaps we can get a bullet hell block next GDQ? So many different games with different gameplay mechanics!
HONK!
Donate for the awesome skill on show in the Mushihime-sama Futari run - and to make sure we see some more SHMUPs in future AGDQ's ! Loving it (and the runner and the couch's great commentary!)!
Two credits as promised.
This run is absolutely breathtaking! Really, I'm sitting here forgetting to breath watching this ridiculous dodging! Mad props to you Gusto HONK!
first time donator brought out of his hole by the impossibly ridiculous bullet dodge, from one bullet-heck enthusiast to another... HOW?
OwO Whats this? Mushihime at GDQ? So awesome to see this. Can't wait to see the crowd go crazy over Larsa's fight. Cave block next year hype!
I LOVE CAVE shmups! So Happy to see this being run!
What the hell??!?! Best commenting so far. It’s great because my head hurts trying to keep up! Amazing show of skill. Stay hydrated gusto!
Donation going to animorphs because everyone watching tonight needs to really experience this game. Keiz's run at agdq2016 is in my opinion one of the most entertaining runs in gdq history
JUICY
Just want to know where I can get a pillow that will help me dodge bullets like Gusto. Thanks.
I love this shmup superplay exhibition! Definitely would love to see more of this at future events. Also, kill cancer with the very juiciest cancel.
Didn't plan to donate yet but this SHMUP run is just bonkers. Game, runner, couch, all very entertaining. I'm certainly down for more of this, bring on the CAVE block. Put my money towards the OoT glitch exhibition, and thank you to everyone involved in this wonderful event!
First time seeing a shmup like this. INCREDIBLE! THANK YOU for the feels.
Can we get a JUICY $5 bullet hell train going?
 (Comment rejected)
This bullet hell exhibition is absolutely bonkers.Wow. Just wow
I'll donate $25 for each of following Wisconsin city and town names the announcer can correctly pronounce:AshwaubenonOconomowocKaukaunaWaunakeeGood luck, and Godspeed.
A shooting game? In my GDQ? Hell must have finally frozen over. Not sure why there was the official/unofficial ban for so many years but I am glad to see it gone. Maybe we'll get a Touhou game (other than Shoot the Bullet) some day...
My dad is currently fighting stage 4 colon cancer and still going strong, i'm so happy and thankful that you guys are doing all this to help others that it brings tears to my eyes. thank you everyone!!
 (Comment rejected)
First time seeing this ... IT IS AWESOME ... love it, thanks for such a good show before going to bed, greetings from Germany
Gusto did an amazing job with this super-difficult and beautiful shmup! We need more of this genre in Games Done Quick! I'm totally down for a CAVE shmup block! Thanks to all the runners and support staff, and let's have an awesome rest of the week!
#Kyogre	Kiss you all !
Always happy to see this event every year, and happy I can afford to contribute this time. I've lost multiple family members to cancer, and I'm glad so many of us are fighting. Putting this to the Ocarina of Time Glitch Exhibition. AGDQ Hype!
Mushihime-Sama Futari has me on the edge of my seat, here's $50 for an incredibly juicy run
This Mushihime-sama Futari run is amazing. Thanks for another great GDQ. Please put this donation toward runner's choice.
HOLY CALZONE That was absolutely NUTS!! Gusto is the TRUE Bug Princess!!! Had to donate after that, let's see more people following suit, come on!!
I've never seen or heard of this game before but me and my friends are absolutely mesmerized by this run. Gusto is another level of human. Much love from England
The Mushiihime-Sama Futari is very good. Gusto is amazing.
I've been a Danmaku fan for the past few years, and just had to donate for this great Mushihimesama run. Sick music, sick patterns, sick game play. Maybe next year we'll see Dodonpachi too.
this bullet hell game is completely incredible. and the play, naturally. major kudos to Gus, I've never seen anything like this
Mushihime... that run was amazing~
It's been a blast attending GDQ in person for the first time. Show me Animorphs, Keizaron!!
Long time watcher, first time donator. Keep up the great work.
Wow wowow! Gusto's run was amazing!
Have to donate for that AMAZING Mushihime-sama run! Talk about clutch!
Hi ron!
Donating for those amazing dodges by gusto!
I love schmups and it's so great to see it finally represented. Love schmups and love GDQ. I hope to see more schmup runs in the future.
Mr. Gusto, you have floored me. Here I am almost having a heart attack, and you're casually dodging insane numbers of bullets by pixels. Money goes to your choice.Respect
Be right back, got to drink 5 litres of coffee in order to lower my pulse after that Mushihime-sama Futari run. Incredible!
I should probably be sleeping, but this amazing Mishihime-sama Futari run is just too mesmerizing to shut off.
HOLY BULLET HELL THAT WAS INSANE
Home sick and enjoying another great GDQ event. My thanks to all the great people involved, from the runners to the technical staff and the great couch support. We really appreciate your dedicating your time and talents to a great cause. Go fast!
I had to donate after that absolutely incredibly insane Mushihime-sama run. I've never spent a whole run with my jaw on the floor! My HEART!
M U S H IF U T A R I
I turned on AGDQ while I was doing some chores around the house and COMPLETELY stopped in my tracks to watch this run of Mushihime-Sama Futari. That is the most insane performance I've ever seen in my life and I can only imagine how much effort and practice it took to figure out how to beat this monstrosity of a game. Thank you for using your gaming super powers to defeat cancer! Donating this in memory of my beloved grandmother, who passed away from cancer when I was just 11. I miss you everyday, Ohma. This is for you.
Loving all the runs so far, Mushihime-Sama Futari looks super intense, phenomenal run Gusto! I had a coworker who recently passed from cancer, so I want to donate for him. Thank-you, runners -and- donators, for doing these awesome GDQ events, they all go to such fantastic causes.Shoutout to all the lovelies in the front row jamming out in between games! Y'all are made of pure joy (and I -love- your floppy ear hat, it gives me life)
Shoutout to our friend in the crowd LittleNapoleon who went to AGDQ without telling us! Don’t worry, Jessie, Grace, Marion and the rest of the gang are doing well back at home! Put this forwards Animorphs for reasons LN will understand!
Yo Raichu! The Metal Gear community is stoked for your run! Even Don Taylor is watching! Now let the legend come to life and bring some of that Irish Thunder! Here's a donation for runner's choice. #MGSR is behind you.
Long-time watcher, first-time donator, shout out to my sister Eowyn who is a first-time watcher
That run was nuts! I wanted to donate during Mushihimesama, but I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!
Amazing play from Gusto
Juicy!
That run was absolutely mind-boggling. Do it all the way!
Gotta support my boy Raichu, I know you'll do great. Since Snake Eater singing was already met, this is for the legend of Animorphs to continue. #MGSR is here behind you. P.S. Shoutouts to Kojima out there in the crowd.
After... whatever that was, I don't think we can hold off on sending in our second community donation any longer! Good luck from Bird School to all the upcoming runners! Our donation goes to Gusto's choice.
J U I C Y
I have to donate after that Mushihimesama Futari run. I've never been more stressed watching a speedrun in my life! Amazing run! Can we get a huge HONK! for Gusto!
Holy honk, that Mushihime-sama Futari run was the most insane thing I have seen at AGDQ. What a champion!
Games Done Quick? More like... HONKS Done Quick!
Good luck to the mgs3 run, shoutouts to the waypoint community for being an amazing place to watch all these run along with. And shoutouts to vapor snake
Dance Dad and Co. You are legends. You're the heroes that GDQ needs!
Thanks to Mushihime-sama me and the edge of my chair have never been so well acquainted.
I love how a pokemon is running MGS3. My donation goes towards my closest friend who went through cancer and beat it! You go Raichu! #mgsr
 (Comment rejected)
That Mushihime-sama Futari run was incredible, Gus is a legend! I'm overjoyed to see them representing Shmups at AGDQ. I hope to see more in the future.
long time watcher, first donation.What a intense run! I think my neighbors woke up, because i felt to much with it.
donating for that oot glitch exhibition! it's what we all need
That Mushi run was INSANE! Everyone should make a donation of dollars that you won’t want to dodge or cancel.
GDQ is perfect to get my mind of the Vocational exams coming up.
Putting this towards naming the Fire Emblem: Three Houses protagonist as Bartre! BARTRE THE BRAVE WILL DESTROY THE COMPETITION! WARRIOR POWER!
Bullet Honk FTW
Tell Prolix It's good enough, here's that extra 15, and gus, you did incredible!
You CQC'd some money out of my wallet. You're....pretty good.
HONK intensifies?
A dollar for every year of life I just lost and I wasnt even playing this. I. am. scared.
Gutted that I have to go to bed for work before my favourite Zelda Fast Gamer's run as it's midnight here in the UK - put this towards the glitch exhibition!
SNAAAAAAKE!!!
Hey Raichu, You're Waisting your Ammo! I am glad the Irish postal Service got you over to Orlando. If I dont see a white flash I am launching an inquisition! But of luck to you buddy, glad to see you over there showing us off , Also praise that Kojima pillow.#MGSR
Thank you for keeping my boyfriend company while he has to write reports for university. You guys are amazing!
Metal Gear Solid 3: Crab Battle!!!
Snake? SNAKE!? SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!
Must have Banjo as the file name. Honks are not for this run zfgMad. Seriously though, super excited to see nsr at gdq and good luck to ZFG!
Hey Raichu, Platonic here. Watching the run from the MGSR discord with everyone else. Best of luck with the run I know you'll absolutely dismantle it <3 #MGSR
Gotta donate to a good cause. Including having banjo as the filename for ZFG's Ocarina of Time run.
Because I missed donating during the Final Fantasy run I went with my second favorite RPG series. This donation is because this is a very close to my heart because my husband is a cancer survivor because of early detection. Honk cancer no one else has to go through cancer ever again.
shouts out to my long lost boi ytmnd mcroix. metal gear is the best so pour 1 out for kojima
Kept you waiting, huh?
yo don’t forget to drops a follow to Raichu metal gear solid, also this isnt MGS4? #MGSR
I love metal gear the series, its very "Solid". Bad puns aside good luck on the run snake. Snake? Snake!? SNAKKKKKKKKEEEEEEE!
Huh?! What was that noise? Sounds like an awesome run from RaichuMGS
Hey Raichu! We're cheering you on in the MGSR discord wishing you the best on your run! By the way, did you know you can find Don Taylor in MGS3 using only the 360 camera? #MGSR
How exciting
What a thrill~ To see Metal Gear Solid 3 at AGDQ! Hey Raichu, you got the MGSR discord server filled with friends all cheering you on! We're all proud of you <3 Go sneak around and hope you find a Kerotan on the way. Kero Kero#MGRS
 (Comment rejected)
Best of luck to you, Raichu! All of us in the Metal Gear Speedrun Community are rooting for you. Remember, it's not just a box, it's a way of life. #MGSR
Hey, RaichuMGS! You're pretty good! Will donate another 10$ if you give me your best MEOW! -finger guns-
Watching since 2011. Mmmm... quite tasty!
Great to see MGS3 at GDQ. Let's CQC cancer.
Go go Zelda Glitches! So much hype!
Whoa, this host is amazing! Hope we'll be seeing a lot more of her, whoever she is. 25 more bucks if she sings the chorus to Snake Eater (just the "I'm still in a dream" bit). Donation goes towards the bonus game, because the more runs, the better.
Big shout out to Raichu and the rest of the amazing MGS3 speedgame community!
Keep it up, y'all
Hello from Australia! Had to delay my first ever donation until one of my favourite games. Guess you could say that I kept you waiting, huh? Good luck with the run!
Preventing cancer is the most important part of this week, but the Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition is the second most important. Let's meet this goal.
No honk pls
I give my life, not for Honor, but for RaichuMGS to have a great Snake Eater run!
:D
First time watching live and new viewer of ZFG, had to donate after hearing that new glitches have been found for one of my favorive games
What a thrill! 🎵 Been looking forward to this speed run of one of my all time favourite games. Best of luck
I've been wanting to donate for years. Finally I am able to do so. Greetings from Spain. Keep it up and let's beat cancer!
Gotta love how simple and straightforward and never convoluted the MSG series story is...right? (hello to ateatree from goodfriends!)
Oh no it's time for METAL GEAR!! quick shoutout to my fellow Knights of the Round, (and hiiii Geeky) Let's unlock some ANIMORPHS!!!
This donation is like 15 cents for every rung in that one ladder. Y'all know the one.
What a thrill to be at my first AGDQ with my best friend. 🎵What a thrill... 🎵
Thank you AGDQ staff and all the supporters working hard to make this event possible. Good luck on your run ZFG!
[(To hopefully be read during heart piece duping, if ZFG allows for donations to be read during that segment and doesn't need to focus on counting. I don't know if he is going to want to focus on counting during that, if he does, maybe read whenever <3 I'm a longtime watcher of ZFG so I'd really really appreciate if it got read, thank you! :) (If not I understand, you guys have HOARDS of donations to choose from)]-----------------------------------------------------------------------------Hey there, Zesty Female Gamer!I just wanted to wish you good luck on your run!Rumor has it that using lens can help you break free of Morpha.And did you know that RBA is the reason you can't bring a filled bottle past airport security?Put this towards the filename "Pay Dry". What? that isn't a name option? Why? Well, put it towards Banjo because..."When Banjo?"
Researching games to speedrun is a lot like researching a cure for Cancer. It takes a lot of time, effort, and resources to do both, and when you have a breakthrough, it improves the lives of everyone in the community. Let's make sure that people always have enough resources to do both. Oh, and let's get that Super Hydlide Joke Percent, People.
Hrngh, Colonel, I'm trying to sneak in a donation, but I'm dummy thick, and the clap from the audience keeps alerting the runner.
Gus's Futari run is the best thing I've seen since his STG Weekly appearance. More of this!
Love what you guys put up for really great causes. As a researcher I can testify that it does matter, to patients, to families and to research teams.
First time donating, had to make sure it was during my favorite game of my favorite series
I have been watching forever but first time donating so i had to donate during snake eater! SNAKE! SSSSSSSSNNNNNNNNNNAAAAAAAAAAKKKKKKKKKEEEEEEE!
Had to donate during one of my favourite games ever. Good luck, Raichu!
HORNETS! What a thrill!
Had to donate for the Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater European Extreme run. Favorite game of all time.
Long time watcher first time donater
MGS3 at AGDQ 2020?What a thrill...
Snake? Snake?! Noooooooo!
Hello Awesome Games Done Quick 2020! I have to donate during my favourite announcer GeekEtiqiette's time on the mic!I'm having the best time watching every minute I can of this marathon like I have done since 2016, some day I dream of joining the wonderful little dance group in the audience.I lost my father to cancer in 2011 and thank you AGDQ for trying to prevent this from happening to more people. One day we'll win!One last thing... HONK!!!
Thanks for the awesome runs and for raising all this money for charity. My brother is currently in remission from testicular cancer and this will be his 4th year. Keep up the great runs! Unfortunately we missed the GnG run but we will watch the recap later!
Hey, AGDQ! Thank you to all of the runners, staff and everyone who makes this possible. Keep fighting the good fight! Can't wait for the ladder section! (Donation goes to runners choice incentive)
be careful, ive heard that snake is DUMMY THICC and a certain clapping MIGHT alert the guards
It's a nice donation, I'll give you that. But the puns give you no comedic advantage whatsoever.
Beat cancer and hopefully your PR's! Good luck runners and I'll always watch!
SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!
Bravo a tous pour cette superbe AGDQ et ces commentaires de qualité !15$ pour Arianne car elle a bercer ma jeunesse ! Courage a tous ceux qui restent cette nuit pour voir du bon Zelda !#MarioLight
What a thriiiilllllll....🎵
Can we get a dab from Raichu? Kappa. For real though, good on you for doing this and good luck with the run. All of us from the discord are rooting for you!
I dunno, I just looked at the run and got the urge to donate. No, not just an urge, it was more than that. It was my destiny, to be here, watching GDQ. Good luck!
For zfg... GO BANJO!!!! AND DESTROY CANCER!!!!
Kept you waiting huh
Metal Gear? This run's... pretty good.
I had to donate for one of my favorites games, Metal Gear Honk 3! Thank you guys for an amazing AGDQ so far.
$5 hype train to see the Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition is taking off.... now! We can do it guys! CHOO CHOO
Always nice to see a Metal Gear game speedran. Maybe just like in the Metal Gear universe, nanomachines will be the answer to everything
Snake? Snake?! SNAAAAKE!!! Honk
Hey Raichu, miss you guys at the MGSR Discord. Best of luck, although you won't need it because... You're pretty good!
Hey Floce, Mericoid and Symphony of the Night! It's a long way from Centu city to you all there, but I trust this sending stone is working properly, I've been doing some tinkering while you were away. Do not fear, I don't plan on being a pain or causing any sorrow in the end. The legend of this "Boss" is farther reaching than we thought, even if the name seems to lack.... spark. I'm looking forward to hearing this melody they call 'Snake Eater'. Legend says it can calm any fury. It is sure to be a treat. Do take care and make sure everyone gets a long rest before embarking on any more night long runs.
Hey raichu, remember our promise, let me see that vent clip. Everyone in MGSR wants to see it.
Ádh mór leis an rith, taispeáin dóibh conas a dhéanaimid é sa bhaile!Shout out to the 502 Krew!
Here's to the oot glitch exhibition! HYYYYYYYYYYYPE!
All the best for the run! Love watching someone else play this game that I've sunk hundreds of hours into, it is great to see! Frick cancer and the Australian bushfires! Love from Australia! PS. I've already donated to the bushfires too!
Revolver Ocelot
Snake Eater is one of my favorite games of all time although I've never seen it speed run. Thanks for everything you do AGDQ team!
Hey everyone, first time donating but I wanted to say thank you to everyone who could make GDQ possible. My grandmother died years ago because of cancer, so the cause kind of hits home for me. So, if its not too much troubles, can I get some extra hype for the runners?
Happy birthday to two wonderful beings! My doggo who turned 7 today and my supervisor who was wonderful enough not only to let me take a full week off work for AGDQ, but is also watching from the office back home. *HONK*
Who's the greatest in the world? BIG BOSS-Good luck on the run Raichumgs!
Fear the deer!
What a thrill
I played Euro Extreme for the first time last week and it was fun but super hard, this run is blowing my mind. Had to donate during my favorite game of all time. Good luck!
First time donating! What better way to spend the day home sick with the flu than participating in this amazing event and watching my favorite game (MGS3)! Good luck with the run!
The flying buckets are real! They are based on the Williams X-Jet, a janky prototype from the seventies.
I really should go to bed because I have work in the morning but I cannot miss seeing a run of one of the greatest games ever made. Good luck on the run Raichu!
hi GDQ!! this run has been a lot of fun, and that mushihimesama run has me completely FUELED and ready to take anything on.but back on topic, today I learned those whacky flying platforms in MGS3's river area ACTUALLY DID EXIST IN REAL LIFE, it's WILD.
I'm excited to be able to donate during my favorite game. I've been watching for about 4 years now, and I get giddy whenever agdq comes around. This donation goes out to my late aunt who lost to cancer 6 years ago now
Box is love, box is life
Metal Gear!
Merci beaucoup pour cette AGDQ c'est juste gènial comme chaque année.Une bonne année 2020 à toutes et tous.
Good luck on the run. Hope it doesn't give you much pain. But if you feel the fear, don't give into the sorrow or fury. It's not the end. Remember, it's all for the joy of playing!
Hi, all at AGQ, What do a call a bandana-wearing caster, Named Raichu? Raichu Raichu? Raichu!!!! (Lightning bolt attack was as Volgin) Shout to Announcer Geeketiquette. Hello From Ace.
good luck to the runner and keep rolling!
When I put it on, I suddenly got this feeling of inner peace. I can't put it into words. I feel... safe. Like this is where I was meant to be. Like I'd found the key to true happiness. You should come inside the box... Then you'll know what I mean.
Pet the dog!
Thanks for all the Metal Gear speedrun lessons over the years. Keep killing it, Irish Thunder. Cheers, mate.
Hey, Raichu. What is Snake's favorite holiday? Box-ing day!
Snake Eater is my favorite game of all time. Now let's sneak past cancer the way only Big Boss could!
First time viewer here. I'm donating today, in support of my cousin Cari and late grandmother Jackie, both having suffered through their own battles with cancer. I'm unfamiliar with how long this event has been going on, but I haven't been able to pull myself away from this stream today. Great content, great entertainment, great people. All for a great cause. Deuces, Cancer!
MGS3 is one of my favorite games, and this run of it is poetry in motion. Let's CQC Cancer!
I’m donating today because I literally just found out a family friend’s cancer has come back after 8-10 years of being in remission.Early Detection is why she is still alive today, so keep the donations coming guys, and runners, keep running! Peace and Much Love.
In loving memory of my grandma Nani. May she Rest In Peace <3 Let's beat cancer!
This is the END... for cancer that is! Awesome to see MGS3 run at gdq.
"Metal gear? Greg Kinnear? Caddle fear?" Greetings from finland. Glad to donate for a good cause when MGS is being played on AGDQ!Amazing run so far Raichu.
Nothing to see here
#Pokelou Je n'arrive pas à fermer les yeux après le dernier run, le Bullet Hell, là ;-) Continuez comme ça, merci !
thank you for this great event. sad to say we lost our uncle today due to cancer.
What's that sound? Guess it was nothing.
Have to donate for my favorite ladder climbing game SNAKE EATER!!!
Here's $500 for the crowd to give me their best "SNNNNNAAAAKKKEEEE!!!"
Treat your cardboard box with care. Take care of the box and it'll take care of you. Don't think of it as just another box. Treat it with love... Don't be rough
My friend Tim just found out he was HIV positive and hes having a hard time with it but he loves watching your show. Thank you for bringing smiles to peoples faces.
I just want to shout out to my girlfriend. Love you!
Hey RaichuMGS, an extra $10s if you get the Tsuchinoko snake!Thanks to GDQ for all the good they do. Long time watcher!
These boss strategies for MGS3 may be the funniest things I've seen all week. I'm so glad my favorite MGS is getting played for GDQ.
Snaaaaake Eater!
You're pretty good.
From France, with love. Thanks you all for the donations, an amazing show every year
roited avaricious cone violence
Greetings from Sydney, Australia. Amazing MGS run! Hopefully the final donations tally rivals the Philosopher's Legacy. Thanks AGDQ for another marvellous event.
Looks like snake needs some ramen noodles mixed with coffee
First time watching GDQ with a friend. She complained about the lack of glitching in this run!
Happy to donate during my best friend’s favorite game! She’s watching this with me and watching her mind be blown is one of the best things ever. Put my donation towards the Orcarina of Time glitch incentive, because that will blow MY mind!
I haven't even seen Animorphs but I need to see it.
Congratulations everyone for making this event wonderful!
Norrissey here. First time watching AGDQ live after viewing literally hundreds of hours worth on YouTube. It's making the week go by so much faster. Shout out to Raichu who is killing this game. Thanks for the laughs during the scientist section. Save the cardboard boxes, kill the animals.
Donating for Raichu blazing through one of my favorite games of all time. Love this event and love the cause!! Will double the donation if we can get Snake Eater sung on stage :)
Love me some GDQ
Here's $5 so someone can buy the hungry couch a sandwich.
Kojima is God!Kojima is God!Kojima is God!Everybody say!Kojima is God!Kojima is God!
please... feed the boy
*slow chant* glitches glitches glitches
I'm glad I'm in the middle of cooking dinner as all of this food talk during the MGS3 run is making me incredibly hungry.
RaichuMGS, do you think donations can bloom on the battlefield? Oh, look, they can!
Just got home, fire up the stream and immediately hear a familiar accent! An Irish Runner!?! That deserves a donation from an Irish AGDQ fan, regardless of game. Though MGS is a nice bonus.
how does that box fit in his pocket...???
Wow, this Metal Gear Solid run is great. Never played the game, and I don’t want to because it seems way too stressful, but it’s amazing to watch!
Theres only one thing I can say about this run. What a thrill.
Loving to see a very fond game of mine being ran once again at AGDQ, Yhank you so much to everyone from runners to the staff for making such an awesome event possible, good luck Raichu! Never let go of that cardboard box!
That mushihime-sama run was insane and stoked for NSR. Great job with MGS3 too so far! Love gdq!
The metal gear solid series, got me to know some of my best friends, love mgs3.
MGS3 and Awful Block are the things I'm most hyped for this AGDQ. The first Metal Gear Solid influenced my entire career, and 3 was and still is IMO the peak of the MGS series. Now let's get that Joke% Super Hydlide incentive met!
I'm making this donation for my partner, Kevin, who defeated cancer, and introduced me to GDQ. I'd also like to remind him I AM a cool person!
This cause is near and dear to my heart. My friend timothy had his cancer caught in the early stages and even though he lost his testicles he survivied. Thank you for what you do!
Hey Raichu, doing great! Seems like... "you're pretty good!" Keep it up man and all the best!
Would somebody please feed Snake?
Hey All, Yetee Here! Ladders and Fire-Proof Boxes? What a thrill! Loving this amazing run! Let's gooooo!
A tactical box is the safest place to be in a fire
Thank you AGDQ for keeping the week interesting for my friends and I. My brother in law's mother just got diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer, hoping this donation can help with the preventative measures needed to defeat cancer. Keep fighting the good fight!
Hi GDQ, a friend of mine was diagnosed with liver cancer today. I can't do anything about it but donate for a better future for others. Put this towards Banjo as OoT name, because ZFG's chat needs it.
I'll donate an additional 10$ if the crowd goes :snake.Snake.SNAAAAAAAAKE!!... and an ADDITIONAL 10$ if the crowd also goes:honk.Honk.HOOOOOONK!!
snake? Snake?! SNAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!!!!!!!
Greetings from Czech Republic! Lets fight together!
long time watcher first time donator to agdq.if you can call my name out correctly, i'll spent another 25 dollar, so here's a hint: my name is an old german name ;) good luck
What am I doing here?
Metal Gear and Zelda? Sooo, no sleep for me, i guess... I'll just sleep at school tomorrow! Unfortunately I'm the teacher... Well, I guess it'll self study time, kids!Greetings from Thursday and thanks you all for doing a great job!
Y'all talking about how "smart" the guards are in this game reminds me of how back in the day when they were hyping up MGS2 they bragged about how much of the PS2's processing power was dedicated to guard AI. Donating for the Fire Emblem: 3 Houses run to be Black Eagles, because EDELGARD DID NOTHING WRONG.
favorite time of the year is GDQ, goodluck to all the speedrunners
Snake?!!? SNAKE!!!! SAAAAAAAKKKE
This is my favorite Metal Gear Solid game, and that's taking the last section of the second game into account. Continue fighting the good fight and let's see those Ocarina of Time glitches.
This run is pretty... solid
I'm glad someone finally appreciates my rolling hitbox design!
Keep being awesome everyone! Shout out to INFED <3
Hey GDQ Hanging out as my First GDQ I've caught Live looking foward to the The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time Glitch Exhibition match an see my favourite game be broken so thoroughly Ocarina Time was the first console game I ever played and so glad to see it at another GDQ, HONK!

Love GDQ and the runners! Happy to attend in person this year.Shout out to my wife Courtney who is my best friend and the love of my life.
The brethren of the shadow realm (lurkers) are loving the run so far! Keep it up! <3 Let's kick Cancer to the curb where it belongs. Much love to everyone on the team, the runners, the couch members and the host!
Trust the Process! Keep up the good work!
for the Cadence of Hyrule, Seed Name. ariane and bourrez the don
Snake make sure to examine the back of the CD case.
Kinda feel bad my last attempt to snipe the incentives just before a run failed, so I'm doing it a lot earlier this time. This is in memory of my brother Jesse, who died fighting brain cancer - and this filename was his self chosen nickname.
Let's get that Animorphs run in!
Took a day off work to make sure I was here to see zfg’s OoT 100% NSR run. I’ve been enjoying watching him prepare and I’m super excited to see it live. Hope we don’t end up with “run ogre!”
Lets go for the Zelda glitch exhibition!!
MGS 3 is one of my favorite game, glad to see it on run on AGDQ! Snake? Snaaaaakkeeeeeee!!
Donating during one of my favorite games ever! I will donate $10 more if the announcer says shoutouts to Cameron
Happy birthday to Herb!
Let's CQC Cancer!
Thanks GDQ for giving me and my husband something to watch together. Down with cancer!
I'm glad that I'm finally watching a GDQ live!! I've watched countless reruns over the years, but have always wanted to donate while watching! Thank you to everyone involved in coordinating the event, you are all amazing!
No message, No problem.
Banjo

Hello Rai, looking forward to hanging out tomorrow. Good luck and remember to press R1 to stare.
Hey this guy looks like Iroquois Pliskin, what gives? Also, if the cardboard box hasn't reminded you, use your Prime Sub!
SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!

I absolutely have dialogue if you pet me! you just don't speak dog.
Snake? Snake!? SNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAKE!!!! ....sorry, there was a snake in my room. Here's a 10 dollar donation for the Animorphs run.

Banjo is the way
#NoComment
long time watcher, first donation. Good thing Snakes have 9 lives, I think?
It's time to bonk that honk button! Let's get it AGDQ! Repeat after me: HONK!
Absolutely loving the MGS3 run, seeing Snake combat roll and box-walk his way through heavily defended areas totally undetected is incredible. Let's match the Philosopher's Legacy and get the donations all the way to *One Hundred Billion Dollars, divided up and hidden all over the world!* to fight cancer.
Snake, Goose, both hide in boxes to sneak into places. I don't see the difference.
Lost my dad to cancer in 2015. No one should have to go through what he did, and everyone should have access to early cancer screenings and other preventive measures. This is the least I can do, and I hope to do much more in the future. AGDQ is getting us one step closer to eliminating cancer from our planet!
Better late than never to get here to watch a run to one of the greatest games to ever exist! much love keep it up
You didn't get the snake but I had to give the money anyway. This is an amazing run. The best metal gear in just over an hour. Amazing!
snake... snake? SNAKE!!!!!!Also, hi geeke and AGDQ :)
Beat Cancer! Eat all the dumplings, love you humphrey.
Hrrrrnnggh Colonel, I'm trying to honk around but I'm goosey thicc and the honk from my goose beak keep alerting the guards
If only there was a place where I could learn about speedrunning Metal Gear Solod 🤔
What a great event this has been. Put this towards the Ocarina of Time filename incentive. Hopefully we can see ZFG finally play banjo on stream!
Cheers to my friends Pedro, Tiago and Joel that are loving this speedrun!
Trans rights are human rights!
Not for honour, but for HONK
Snake Eater is in my Top 5 of all time, and I'm excited to see it at AGDQ! Good luck, and let's kick cancer's butt!
Smile!
Donating for zfg’s oot glitch expo, and to end preventable cancers! Good luck zfg and all runners!
Toujours un plaisir de suivre ce marathon. L'AGDQ est l'un de mes événements préféré sur twitch et c'est en partis du à la qualité du staff du restream FR.Cette année le cancer à touché un de mes proches, c'est vraiment une sale maladie. Je souhaite une bonne fin de marathon à tous les viewers/commentateurs /ambianceurs. Gardez la pêche

1am here but got my Tayto sandwich and tea, great run Raichu man!
Ocarina of time glitches PLEASE!!!
Honks are this decade’s vuvuzelas, but twice as deafening. Don’t @ me :P <3
Lost a grandfather to cancer last week, it sucked. You know what doesn't suck? Ocarina of Time! Especially now that I'm playing the randomizer! Here's some money toward that glitch exhibition, Zelda 64 glitches are amazing. May the way of the hero lead to the Triforce!

honkhonkhonkhonk
Did someone say hitbox? -to be said in the same style as Dracula from Castlevania- "What is a hitbox?! A MISERABLE PILE OF PIXELS! ....but enough talk...." HONK!
Looking forward to the ZFG run since he's the GOAT! Donation goes to the Destiny 2 Riven Legit fight. Just becuase the rest of the community does it, doesn't make it acceptable in a speedrun.
Keiz demands we meet Animorphs. LET'S GO
These guards are very... 'special'. Facepalm. Love the run.
Hey GDQ! Got to donate for the Legend of ZFG being on OoT home soil! Show us the Power of No Source Requirement.Keep going y'all!Also: Not today Dampé
5 F train for the boss
I don't usually "metal" with puns because they really grind my gears, but some have been solid during this run.
Why do chicken coops have two doors? Because if they had four doors they'd be chicken sedans! Waga baba bobo! Shout out to hen house <3
HONK!
F (for the Boss)

If there was ever a reason to donate, beside this amazing cause, it's for Sumichu's amazing voice. Absolutely incredible! Thank you so much!
I was all about sticking to my budget this month until Sumi belted out Snake Eater. What a great performance, and what an awesome run by Raichu on MGS3. Anyway, put this toward that OoT Glitch Exhibition!
Can't wait for the crazy things in this OOT run!
Damn... that song was stunning.I'll go honk in silence for a bit.Money goes to commenters choice.
What a thrill!
Anyways... can we get a $5.00 dono train for this Ocarina of time run
Can't wait to see my favorite runner, ZFG aka 'Zelda Freaky Glitcha' run OoT 100% NSR. Here's to the glitch exhibition incentive so more people can see more cool glitches.
Stop the honk!
Cancer itself is a cancer that takes away our family, friends, and pets. Here's to putting an end to it once and for all.
Having a great time watching AGDQ with my Fiance Angie, I love you
Honk for lonk!
Let's see that glitch exhibition
honk
I am so hyped for ZFG to talk more than he does on stream in a year, in the next three hours. HYPE!!!!
Animorphs on Game Boy Color NEEDS to return to GDQ.We need a revenge match after what it did to Keizaron last time.
Tuned in just in time to hear my favourite version of Snake Eater! Awesome un Raichu!
Banjo when, ZFG????????
So happy to see all the wonderful silly hats in the crowd. Shout out to Daddy hat DJ. Don't forget gamers, hydrate, hype and HONK!

I can't watch because I'm at work, but I know my boyfriend is at home watching. Hi sweetie.
Here's $25 for Sumi's amazing performance.
ZFG, when is banjo? OOT glitch exhibition HYPE.

Kill the animals... down with HONK! Banjo when?
Hope you feel better, Lewy. Love you
I had to donate during my favorite speedrunner's run, shoutouts to ZFG! Donating one dollar for every year he's been alive, happy birthday ZFG and good luck on the run! Let's get that glitch exhibition!
I cant wait to see that glitch exhibition! BREAK MY FAVORITE GAME PLS! also HONK!
My favourite speedruner is destroying my favourite childhood game on my birthday? How could I not donate! Sadly hasn't been a great birthday as I got food poisoning, can I get a "feels birthday man" from ZFG to feel better?
I'm unemployed, but cancer is far far worse. If I can give this money, so can you! Don't go to McDonald's tomorrow. Boom: 5$. Shout out to AGDQ for putting on this amazing event and supporting such a great cause where 100% of the donations go to the prevent cancer foundation! Spoilers: not all charities donate 100%, which makes this event THAT much better. Looking forward to Ocarina!
Been looking forward to Zfg all week!
ZFG's 2018 AGDQ run of OOT is what got me in to watching speedruns. I'm so excited to see his upcoming run. ZFG HONK!Put this towards getting J_Hobz on the couch for the Animorphs run.
My mom just got diagnosed with cancer just a few moments ago :( I hope you guys can help her! I love you all
It is written: Only Honk can defeat Ganon.Great! I can't wait to bomb some dodongos.
Wacky Hundo is Best Hundo

#ArianeMon père a eu le cancer mais ça a été pris à temps, maintenant il est en pleine forme.Continuez comme ça les commentateurs. Bisous sur les 4 joues.
Donating to defeat cancer, and of course, HONK!
Said I would donate $10 for every Zelda game I was able to watch, so here is another $10 with an additional $40 because this is the best game in the series!! My mom introduced me to Ocarina of Time when I was 7 and I have been addicted ever since! Good luck on your run ZFG and heres to getting to 700,000 during tis run!!! Can I get a HIYAAA from the audiance?
We lost our mother this year to stage 4 lung cancer. My brother donated his hair, I'm donating money. I hope this helps to develop earlier detections so other families don't have to go through what mine did. The incentive goes to runner's choice.
Ocarina of time finally, can't wait until the super Mario 64 randomizer
Thank you to all the staff of GDQ, people watching at home and at the event, the many many donations, and the runners. This is an amazing example how video games bring people together for a great cause. Keep up the great work in getting rid of Cancer!
Encore un don assez tard, les runs de zelda étant définitivement cette année à des heures pas posssible. Bref merci encore tout le monde de faire le taf, que ce soit les commentateurs ou le chat, et bien sur les runners, continuez pour Arianne!! (et toujours contre le cancer) #Tempetedesang
After both of my parents have fought cancer (both survived, thankfully), take this to help put cancer down (also, tackling kids.........cancer)
I'm so excited to see my favorite speedrunner and streamer running one my my favorite games at AGDQ! Good luck ZFG!
Let's see some Animorphs!
Let's get this Keizaron run!

My husband's dream was to make video games and introduced me to the joy of Ocarina of Time. I lost him to cancer many years ago but he still lives in my heart container. Good luck ZFG!
I was introduced to speedruns through GDQ in 2014 and I've loved them ever since. Thank you for holding these events and supporting important charities.Also, shoutouts to Cooper Perry.

Happy birthday zfg
Had to donate during ZFG's run!
Zelda and Megaman. 2 legendary legends.
Some amazing stuff happening at this GDQ. Awful block is too late for me to stay up, but maybe I'll catch some of it in the morning. Honk.
Crush it ZFG!
Hey ZFG, good luck on the run! Hopefully once you're done with NSR, you can get to Banjo by the end of the century!
Super stoked for these Zelda blocks!!! Can I get a "Hey! Listen!" from the crowd???
Good luck ZFG! Always looking forward to runs like NSR, very ready to see the glitch exhibition.
Hey GDQ!! I am really enjoying this event so far, and I just had to donate during one of my top 5 games of all time!

Woo AGDQ!
Greetings again from your friendly neighborhood gamer! I figured it was about TIME I donated to a GDQ, since I've been watching for years. Don't forget to make use of your fairy friend, she's your NAVI-gator! Don't worry, I won't GORON too long. I made sure not to TRI and FORCE these puns too much.
Here’s to Keizaron’s suffering! Just kidding we all love you! Honk!!!!! Ps. Thank you to everyone who helped with this event
Have to donate during my first experience from my favorite series
Good luck on the run ZFG! Don't forget to put your extra rupees towards the glitch exhibition.
My girlfriend introduced me to AGDQ, and speedrunning in general, a year ago. It all started with that Majora's Mask run last year. Now, I can't get enough of this stuff. Especially Zelda and Pokemon runs. Legend of Zelda is one of my favorite game series. Majora's Mask might have been the first speedrun I watched, but OoT was the first Zelda game I played, and I instantly fell in love with it.Shout out to AGDQ, shout out to The Legend of Zelda, and shout out to my girlfriend. I love you, Poro!
I love you all. Honk.
Been watching gdq for years now, proud of everything this community has done! Let's get some honking hype for the legend of banjo.
Thank you for this amazing event again. Let's make that glitch exhibition a reality. Good Luck for every runner,
OoT means it is time for my third donation of the week
Getting Hype for the 4th best Zelda game, and 2nd best 3-D Zelda title. But 4th best Zelda still makes it one of the all time great games.Go-go Banjo, the hero of time!
Good Luck Zelda Fan Girl! Play banjo someday!
Good luck to the runner!
Donating so that Kiez can continue his tradition of having his gdq runs go terribly wrong in hilarious ways.
Hey Listen!
Been watching since 2012 and this is the best AGDQ yet. 10 more years!
I love AGDQ and ZELDA OOT was my favorite child hood game like many of you. Much love for the Community!
Let's get that OoT glitch exhibition!
Hey, listen! Third time donating to AGDQ and Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games of all time! Good luck!
Hey! Listen!
My dog Zelda and I are super hyped to see that glitch exhibition! Let's see it happen!
Let's go zeldooooo
I can't wait to see how more broken OoT is. Good luck to ZFG, and lets get that glitch exhibition met.
Alright guys, how about a big old round of applause?!
Honk cancer!
I don't know where each of these dollars came from, but here's one for each percent!Happy birthday, ZFG! Good luck on the run!
OoT is the best game ever. Took me a few years to beat it... no joke I got stuck in Dodongo's Cavern as a kid. But this is still by far my favorite game. Thanks ZFG for doing this run!
Gotta donate during my favorite game of all time, let's get that OOT glitch exhibition! Good luck on the run ZFG!
honk honk let's get those donations in for the glitch exhibition, PLEASE! Here's 5 five-dollar donations towards it-- I'm counting on the rest of you to chip in your pieces too! Let's band together to break the game-- and break cancer, too!
My first day off of work in 8 weeks, and I can't think of a better way to spend it than with MGS 3, Zelda OOT, and (hopefully) Animorphs. The 3 best games ever.
I won't get to watch it live. But forcing to Keizeron to play a game he hates... And fight cancer... Shut up and take my money
First time donating, love what you guys are doing! Watching mushihime was the highlight of my day. Whenever I looked away I would see a bunch of dots.

Saw that Cadence of Hyrule cross-stitch and had to donate. Good luck to ZFG1 and both the Cadence of Hyrule runners. As a fellow Cadence of Hyrule runner, the planned tournament has me motivated to do more runs. Donation goes towards OoT glitch exhibition.
Ocarina of time speedruns are always sick, keep up the good work everyone!

Hey! Listen! Let's get the $10 donation train rolling and that Animorphs incentive met in addition!
Absolutely love, LOVE OOT and ZFG is an amazing runner. I want to thank all who make this event happen every year to help beat cancer, and to wish ZFG a big happy birthday.
Beat cancer honk!
Another donation to this amazing cause! It took me a while to get into Zelda games cuz I thought that I had to play them in order, but Ocarina of Time for the 3DS became my first Zelda game and I've been obsessed ever since! Good luck, ZFG!
Go fast for the emperor!
So glad to see oot at gdq! This is my favorite game of all time! Let’s get the glitch exhibition, and good luck ZFG!
So HYPE for an Ocarina run that I've never seen before! Best of luck ZFG! Shoutouts to the 502 Krew.
I'm really looking forward to a run of what I'm sure we can all agree is the best N64 game. Thank you to all the runners, staff, and volunteers for putting on this event.
A donation for an awesome game and an awesome cause. The money goes towards the Glitch Exhibition, because we just need those weird things in our lifes. Good luck to the runner!HONK!
Hello, GDQ. Ocarina of Time is the game that got me into speedrunning, shoutouts to Runnerguy, and I'm always excited to see it in these marathons. Money to the glitch exhibition, trust me, we wanna see that. Good luck and happy birthday!
Let's see those extra OoT glitches!
Hey! Listen! ... HONK!
Put this to the Glitch Exhibition to delay ZFG's "anyways"
:)
My father was diagnosed with cancer early 2019. He went through surgery and many rounds of radiation after the diagnosis. As of today, he's six months cancer-free. Keep up the good fight, everybody at GDQ. Thank you for everything you do.
This donation is for ZFG's OoT glitch exhibition. Let's obtain this grain!
Honk! is the new Waaa! Orrrrrb is it? Only one way to decide, ask the audience!
Donating in honor of my best friend, Elle.
Good luck ZFG on the Zelda run! Putting this towards seeing Keizaron morph into a goose.... that's what that Animorphs thing is, right?
Howdy from Texas! Had to donate during my favorite series and for the lovely KungFuFruitCup! Shoutout to all those first time GDQ runners and best of luck on all the runs. Donation towards Animorphs because that run is a MUST.
Let’s Go!
Love OoT and GDQ and zfg and all you viewers too!
My favorite time of year is here! Love watching GDQ, especially the Awful Games Block. Can we get Animorphs met so I can see it? Thanks!
Gotta donate to that Animorphs run. Animorphs donation train anyone? come on it will be fun!..... well except for the runner sorry Keizaron.
Hey! Listen! ..... HONK!
Hi GDQ! We’ve been watching and coming to these events for years, but this year cancer struck close to home as a friend of ours was diagnosed back in October. We’re donating to do our part to putting an end to cancer! Steph, we’re all thinking of you and know you’ll make it through this! Lots of love from us in Ottawa
Great to see you're finally playing banjo, ZFG! Now, let's be sure to get that glitch exhibition met. I'm doing my part to help out a great cause, but remember: every bit counts, no matter how small!
Good Luck ZFG :) Let’s see some glitches!
Hey ZFG, we love watching your streams and are so glad to see you back at GDQ. Best of luck in your run.
HONK. UNLEASH the GOOSE on cancer. Shout out to Molly, John and Harmonie watching. Love you dearly.
Excited for Animorphs for the start of "Awesome" block! Keizaron speedruns are always "totally flawless" and a blast to watch, so let's get that incentive met!
Greetings from Canada! Had to donate during ZFG's OOT run. Decided to time my own run of OOT today and got 9 hours! So excited to see this game get destroyed in less than a third of that! Let's get that glitch exhibition met and kick cancer's butt!
Ocarina of time is one of the best game!! Continue your hard work Séverine ! HONK
My mother in-law is a breast cancer survivor. Absolutely love what you guys do! The Legend of Zelda series is my all-time fave and Ocarina represents a milestone in gaming history, plus it introduced the Zelda timeline. Now it's TIME to donate... LONK!
Lonk loves to Honk!
You are all doing great work here. Good luck to all the runners!
Had to donate for the glitch exhibition during one of my favorite games of all time. Good luck on the run ZFG, and I'll donate again if Zelda's Letter GIM goes smoothly. Also, you know this doesn't count for Banjo.
If I could morph into any animal it would be the Goose. I too like to cause chaos and pain. Let' see animorphs!!! HONK
Gonna have to miss the Cadence of Hyrule run because it's at impossible o'clock in Europe, but I'm sure it's going to be impressive and entertaining! Good luck Spooty & Goof!
Long time watcher, first time donor. What GDQ has showcased over the years is genuinely the hallmark of gaming, at least to me who always struggled to beat many of these games as a kid. Ocarina of Time was one of those games that I struggled with when I had the opportunity to pick up the controller to play. So, I’m happy to see all the work that goes in to not just understand how the game really works, but to beat it as fast as possible. Put this donation toward the wonderful prizes and saving the animals. Because animals can be saved along with the frames!!
I discovered GDQ about a year ago and it has been nothing short of amazing!!! This is my first time donating but definitely not my last! LETS GOOOOOOOO!!!
First time donator, long time watcher.And what perfect time to donate than during Zelda Ocarina of Time 100%Good luck everybody.
First time watching GDQ and absolutely loving it. Ocarina was one of the first games I ever played, so this is the perfect time for me to start watching.
 (Comment rejected)
Always love watching and listening and donating to GDQ's every year! Also honk or something am i doing this right?
Every Christmas my siblings and I play Ocarina of Time together, passing the controller after finishing a dungeon. It's fun seeing it get broken so we can try to do some these glitches next time we get together!
We watch these events together every year and are happy to finally be able to donate. Thanks to all the runners for all they do to help this wonderful cause. Honk!
Did somebody say prizes? Heck yea! Good luck Zfg with the run and good luck on Dampe. Lets get that glitch exhibition! Also did somebody say Amazon Twitch Prime subscription? $5 sub straight to PCF? Yes. Oh and Honks put for Lunk.... i mean Badger.
It's awesome to see a Rando streamer make the switch to running the vanilla game, and even get into the big leagues of GDQ, way to go ZFG! Shoutouts to the rando peeps that are probably in the audience right now, wish I could BEE there, have a great AGDQ!!
Ocarina of Time was always my favorite game growing up. This money goes to the Glitch demo!
Navi says: HONK! Listen!
Hi AGDQ! I love watching this amazing show every year. Thank you to the talented runners and dedicated tech crew who make it possible. When I saw the Zelda run was coming, I just had to click the donation "Link". Let's beat cancer!
Hey zfg, I noticed that you meant to split, so I did it for you!If this is read on stream before zfg obtains the Master Sword, I will donate for the Master Sword split! (Split is around 15 minutes into run)
Huzband has been watching as long as I’ve known him. Now I work for a nonprofit that has to work all year to raise what games done quick can raise in a week. Happy to donate for the first time.
Hey AGDQ, long time watcher and donator. I love Zelda games so I thought it was time to donate again. Keep up the great work everyone. Let's get that Animorphs incentive met.
The biggest nostalgia bomb of all time. Love the cause!
ZFG has provided me with so much entertainment over the past couple of years, so I had to donate during his run. Let's get that glitch exhibition met!
Thanks for running this event year after year! It’s always a fun time.
Hey AGDQ!! Long time watcher of this amazing event!! Good luck runners, let's get that bonus game tonight, and HOOONNNKKKK!!
BANJOOOOOOO! Looking forward to this OoT Run ^_^
I just had to donate again during Zelda. As we say in Sweden, lycka till!
To the couch commentators apologizing for over-explaning. The Ocarina of Time information is fascinating. I say, PLEASE! Do... Go-ron!
Excited for this Zelda OoT hundo!
As promised for the Cowabunga during the TMNT run, here's another donation. I said 10, but 25 is what it will be. So hype anytime I see OOT or ZFG on GDQ. Put this donation to the Glitch exhibition. Hey audience! Listen! HOOOOONK!
Good luck on the run ZFG. ZFG HYPE!!!!!!
Those words have been in my head since 2016: "Cmon lion, cmon lion, lionnnn, NOOOO". Loved that run, let's make it happen again!
Glitch Exhibition? Shut up and take my money!
Ocarina of time was the first game that got me to watch AGDQ. Now I'm addicted and watch every year. Thanks for endless hours of entertainment, all for a good cause.
Good luck on the run ZFG, can't wait to see you get 1st try Dampe and smash Ganon... wait, hold on... Put this donation towards the OoT Glitch Exhibition, and never forget that the Shop Theme is a total banger in this game.
Go ZFG, always great to see you destroy one of my childhood favourite games, now live at AGDQ. Let's beat cancer together whilst you beat this game. HONK HYPE!
Ocarina of Time baby let's go!
My Girlfriend and I love the Legend of Zelda so I had to donate during ZFG's Link to the past run. Best of luck on the run and lets kick cancer in the butt! 700K HYPE!
zfgSmug
I always have to donate during The Legend of Zelda since it brings back memories from playing classic N64 games together when my (now) wife and I first started dating. I'm Deku Nuts for you, Cas, I love you!
Red B button hype
First time donating! My partner and I first founded our relationship over AGDQ, watching speedruns, and playing Ocarina Of Time randomizers, with ZFG being one of our favourites to watch! I'm so excited for this speedrun, and I wish you the best of luck ZFG!
Hey, merci pour ce que vous faites tous, c’est vraiment super de vous suivre chaque années#YomiCeleste
Great event for a great cause. Thanks for hosting Fu! And good luck on the run ZFG!
AHH, I LOVE YOU ZFG! PLEASE KEEP DOING WHAT YOU LOVE! <3

Hope I get to see ZFG destroy this game. I also hope I get to see him pay Dry
First time dono. Keep up the good work!
Good luck to all the runners!!
Happy to see my favorite game being run again! Shout out to my fellow Zelda cosplayer Nefridelle. If you donate, I'll throw in another $50. Zelda HYYYYYPE!
Enjoying the OOT run! One of my favorites
When I was a kid, my mom would always get me a Zelda game for my birthday. She always supported me and what made me happy, and when she was diagnosed with cancer last year it was my turn to support her. Here's to beating cancer and supporting each other.
zfg Ocarina of Time runs were the first speedruns I ever saw. Looking forward to many more.
I’ve been watching and enjoying GDQ runs for years and wanted to finally donate. Keep up the good work, and let those buggy retro games run!
Saria best girl. Wish I could be there this week but I had to do jury duty, which is just as good as being at GDQ right? Either way, take my money. Also Shoutouts to Slideguy also watching this awesome run. Love ya man.
Good luck with the run!
Hey! Listen.......... HONK!!!
(Please read this. Guarantee the crowd will appreciate it.) About 5 years ago, I was scrolling through YouTube, looking for something to watch. Then I saw first Runnerguy's run in 2013 pop up, thought, no way. Then I watched ZFG's last GDQ run immediately after. When I found out this was for preventing cancer?! Was immediately hooked. ZFG, good luck. Oh yeah.... and.... HONK!!!!
Have to donate during on of my favorite games! The Prevent Cancer Foundation does amazing work and I'm proud that the gaming community supports such a great cause.
Glitch exhibition by THE ZeldaFreakGlitcha? Sign me up!
This has been a tough last few months for me having just lost my mom to cancer back in October to cancer, due to early detection we were able to get two years with her after she was diagnosed and she always enjoyed hearing how the GDQs did. I remember getting Ocarina of Time for Christmas from her back in 1998 and me and her working together to beat it and I love seeing the game be broken good luck with the run ZFG and I guess put this towards runners choice
OOT is my favorite zelda game and we NEED to see those glitches!! we are so close to meeting the goal, if everybody donated five dollars...you know how this goes. I wanna see that goal hit and a donation train started!
HEY LISTEN! I grew up playing Ocarina of Time and love to see it broken at AGDQ. Good luck to ZFG and thank you to the speedrunning community and all the folks supporting and working behind the scenes. Honk on!
Favorite game series of all time, go ZFG! My GF's grandma has been diagnosed with Cancer today, so this year's donation hits home more than ever. Let's prevent dem cancer!
Love the Legend of Zelda but also everything you guys do to help. Let's keep fighting the good fight against cancer! $25 to Animorphs for Keizaron. Honk!
I have always loved the Legend of Zelda series especially Ocarina of Time, so it only seemed appropriate to donate during ZFG's amazing speed run. Now we have to get that Glitch Exhibition.
I've been waiting for this run since ZFG told us he was accepted in October. Anyone thinking of clocking out part way through should definitely reconsider. This is gonna be crazy.
Happy birthday ZFG! Donating $12 to his choice.
Let's see some glitches!
Finally get a chance to watch the legend ZFG run as Banjo! here's to that amazing Glitch exhibition.
Watching our first AGDQ as a married couple. Our cat Saria can’t wait for her “song segment”!
Hey listen! Lets get the puns coming!Why did Zelda send Link back to his original time in OoT?To get a Link To The Past.
 (Comment rejected)
Hey ZFG. Its 2020 now so i have to ask you your favorite question. When's the next randomizer? Good luck on the run.
Good luck ZFG! Great game, great cause, great runner. Thanks to all AGDQ staff and volunteers you are all amazing!
This OOT run has every game breaking glitch you could want . . . but wait - there's more! With the new glitch you can break the game EVEN MORE! Donating to see the glitch exhibition - let's do this!

Was waiting all day for this run. Love you zfg and good luck on the run
keep up the great run guys! Hah Hyun HAAA!
So I heard there was a donation incentive to make Keizaron play Animorphs for the Gameboy, so I knew I had to donate. Let's meet that donation incentive everyone, and make this Awful Block one to remember! Awful games HYYYYYYYPE!!
Hey. I have been watching GDQ for years and I can finally donate. Good luck on the run and Good Luck to my favorite speedrunner ZFG.
Let's get those glitches!
Hey GDQ, I've been sick with the flu through the start of the week and having the marathon this week has turned that from a miserable experience into a comfy one. I always donate during a 3D Zelda game going back to my first donation during the 2017 Wind Waker run while breaking records for most money raised at a GDQ event. Power on and let's break some more records!
Looking forward to a long weekend in with AGDQ! Big thank you to everyone involved, your work means so much to so many people. Here's to many more years of a great thing. Shoutouts to the 502 krew in the crowd and at home
Good luck ZFG on your run! A huge shoutout to the OoT community for being so much fun to be a part of, and for working so hard to make this game the most incredible broken mess around! Thanks to GDQ for an awesome event so far. I'm making this donation in honour of both my Grandad and friend who are fighting with terminal cancer just now.
I have to be up in 4 hours for work but I have to watch this ocarina of time run. Can I get a HYPE!
Zelda games are great. Zelda stuff is pretty great too. Have some money for a Super Great cause!
ZFG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Mother-in-law beat cancer this year. My wife and I want to pay our good luck forward
Good luck with the run, looking forward to everyone's minds being blown. Here's for the glitch exhibition because it's not a proper ZFG stream without "something cool" shown off at the end
 (Comment rejected)
Is that an Animorph's incentive? That hasn't been met yet?! Well that simply won't do at all! Good luck to all of our lovely runners, and let's crush some more incentives to give Cancer a beatdown!
First time donating. Love ZFG's streams and excited to see how this run will go. Let's tackle cancer!!!
I love when OoT is run at GDQs! Gotta donate during one of my favorite games. I had planned on watching with my son Lincoln (Link), but he's sick in bed sleeping already.I'll watch the recording with him later. He's also hype (as hype as a 4-year oldcan be) for Cadence of Hyrule! His room has all Zelda characters and he's very confused as to why he doesn't have any Cadence swag, so I've got my eye on those perlers!Donation goes to that sweet, sweet glitch exhibition
Ocarina of Time is a good game. I played it once.
ZFG destroy my favorite game, but i still think he is one of the best <3
We still have over $40K dollars to go on the bonus game incentive for tonight! Put this money towards the Animorphs run for an awesome start to the awful block!
First time watching this event, and it's just wonderful. So happy to see my childhood games getting showcased and destroyed for such a good cause. This donation is in memory of my Uncle Ricke, who loved games. Hope to see that Ocarina glitch showcase. Thank you!!

SHOW FEET
That Triforce Blanket looks amazing
big fan zfg congrats on being here good luck :)
Long time watcher, first time donor. Had to donate on my favorite childhood game. RIP AND TEAR!
My 2 favorite streamers running and hosting, a highly underrated category in one of my favorite games, 3 fantastic OoT community members on couch, and at least $5.01 in my bank account. Check, check, check, and too scared to check. Been watching this run for a few months and I’m so excited to finally see it here, thanks so much for all you guys do.
Happy birthday to ZFG!
This is a reminder to stay hydrated.

I can't even begin to explain my excitement for this run!! OOT is one of my favorite games of all time and one that my father bought me and siblings. We lost him to cancer 8 years ago and I miss him every day. Thanks to you all and PCF for all the hard work and one day I hope we beat cancer!
GIM? GID? RBA? ISG? NSR? WTF? Get your P's and Q's together, ZFG, and GL on your OOT run!
Long time watcher, first time donating. Ocarina of Time was the first video game I ever beat and is very near and dear to my heart, and watching it and BOTW run at GDQ events was what got me into speedrunning in the first place. It's equally incredible to see the ways this run has evolved over the years, and all in service to an excellent cause. This donation goes towards the Animorphs bonus incentive, a game significantly less near and dear to my heart, because Keizaron deserves a second chance to showcase this masterpiece for the world to see.
Gotta get that OoT Glitch Exhibition
Five dollar train! Let's see those glitches!
Honk! Listen!
Watching with my bro, Nick, good luck with the run Zfg!
Wow, what are these cutscenes? guess i have been just too spoiled with the ZOoTR community :p
big gitch team pls
Awesome event for an awesome cause!!! My mother was just diagnosed recently so this year's event means a lot to me. Just want thank all the runners for their time and all the other donors, hella love to the big hearts out there <3 Honk ;)
Love ZFG, love OOT!
It's 3AM here in Sweden, but I just have to stay up for this Ocarina of Time run!Oh, and also have to see that glitch exhibition.
They say that going fast and beating cancer is on the way of the hero. A little more towards the Glitch Exhibition, because...well, glitch exhibition, that's enough reason, right?
This event has been on my calendar for a month. All my friends are over for a pizza party specifically to watch this run. ZFG is a superhero.
I started watching AGDQ with my boyfriend back in 2014. This year, I'm watching with my now husband and newborn son. Can't wait to show him all the amazing games and gamers out there!Wishing ZFG an awesome run. and can't wait to see the new strats! Thanks to all the runners and staff for a great event this year.
OoT <3
Chilling with our two kitties Sammy and Jester watching this great run! Thanks for everything!
As a poor college student I donate every year on behalf of my family instead of Christmas presents. As soon as I heard ZFG was doing a run I knew when I'd have to donate. The GDQs are my favorite times of year. Thanks for the awesome runs! Let's get this OoT Glitch Exhibition!
So excited to see the last ever run of this route for NSR! Putting this donation towards the glitch exhibition so we can see the new NSR! Love you, Zelda family!
Have to donate during this insane OOT run because this game took me years to beat and y’all make it look so easy! Shoutout to my own couch at home and the person occupying it who introduced me to speed runs, can’t wait to spend forever with you babo
A great event with great people. Using games from my childhood to make a difference in the world. Truly amazing event.
I love you ZFG!!!
I just had to donate during one of my favorite series. The Legend of Zelda. I discovered GDQ in 2016 and the first prize I donated in 2017 was a Legend of Zelda prize. I can't believe how much this event and this community has sucked me in. I'm looking forward to continuing to donate prizes for the next 10 years and beyond. Now let's beat Cancer-dorf!
Million dollars HYPE!
Thanks for making yet another year of legendary content for me to watch at my favorite event of the year!
Frick cancer!
My small donation to the cause, this time to say hi to my friend Nation whom I spotted in the crowd!
Gotta get that glitch exhibition in! Ocarina of time will always have a special place in my heart, so had to donate for not only the best run of the marathon, but the best runner. Oh, and Happy Birthday ZFG!
Hey y'all, gotta donate during a run of the most broken game of all time. Donation goes towards the glitch exhibition. Honk off cancer!!
Completely broken Ocarina of Time speedruns are my favorite part of any GDQ. Also, I'd really love to see another exciting glitch exhibition. Good luck ZFG! FrankerZ
Not a donation train, a donation freighter.
Been waiting all week to see the man... the legend....ZFG! Thanks for continuing to amaze us with those crazy glitches!
Greetings from Mexico. Such a great event and fantastic cause definitely needs the glitch exhibition!
FrankerZ
5 dollars for the glitch exhibition!
I lost my big sister to cancer a month ago and am donating so others hopefully don't have to lose their loved ones like my family and I have.
So excited to be showing my toddler her very first GDQ runs, having been watching for years including while pregnant with her and when she was a little baby. She was waving and saying "HI!" to ZFG over and over during his interview, but had to go to bed before the OOT run started. So I'll donate another 100$ if ZFG says "Hi Ariel!" on stream to help me with confusing my toddler about how watching TV works.
I got up at 2:30 am to watch my favorite Zelda Game. This years GDQ is special as a good friend of mine died in 2019 due to cancer. Thanks for everybody involved in this great event.
I will never tire of seeing Ocarina of time runs at GDQ. Bring on the glitch exhibition!
THE PIT!!!
Ocarina of Time was one of the first games I can remember playing, and it sparked a love of Zelda games for years to come. I'm excited to see ZFG break the game in all sorts of ways I could never imagine as a kid. Thanks to everyone at GDQ, the runners and volunteers for putting on such an awesome event. Let's beat cancer!
Had to donate during one of my favorite games, hoping this helps get us to that OoT Glitch Exhibition! Good luck ZFG!
I donate every year and love to see my favorite childhood games destroyed. This year I can give a bit more. Let's see that glitch exhibition and beat cancer! Good luck to all runners!
Ocarina of Time glitch exhibition? Few games are as insanely broken as this, let's make it happen!! We owe it to the viewers not to Sheik this responsibility...
Had to donate during the best game from my childhood! These runs have been amazing! Keep up the fantastic work and thank you GDQ staff for all you do. Let's see that glitch exhibition.
 (Comment rejected)
Only $16k to meet the clutch expo? Let’s get a $10 train going to reach it? Read my donation and I’ll double it!
Hi AGDQ, i've lost interest in zelda since i watched ZFG's stream playing some randomizer. Then i found myself playing randomizer, up to all sanity and up to no logic. I was always amazed at your level of knowledge of the game and still am. So let's speedrun our way up to millions in help against the true final boss, cancer.
Donating for this awesome Ocarina run and because we need more Animorphs
I still remember the day my friend Mike skipped school to go buy me the gold Ocarina of Time cartridge. Had to donate during this run, even though I never beat the game...
Trust me folx, we want that Glitch Exhibition! Its incredible what ZFG can do!
Here's another $50 for the Glitch Exhibition. I love me some game breaking glitches!
Hey listen...HONK!
Donating to tackle cancer! We also gotta make the Glitch Exhibition Incentive! Good luck ZFG!
Greetings GDQ! Long time watcher, first time attendee! I have to donate during OOT, one of my all time favourite games. Good luck with the run, keep up the good work!
Long time watcher, had to donate for my favorite game of all time! Keep being awesome!
Heres to another OoT run, and Happy Birthday ZFG!! another 15 if the audience sings happy birthday
Thank you for all this. Thank you to eveyone who donates money or their time. This goes to the OOT Glitch Exhibition!
Have to donate during the best game of all time!!!! Good luck ZFG!!!!
Let's link up to get the glitch exhibition!
Hey! Listen!
Let's go ZFG!
pay dry
Hey zfg and gdq! Long time lurker, first time donater. My mom has suffered through both Lymphoma and Breast Cancer, and right now has terminal liver cancer. So hopefully this money helps in the fight to beat cancer. Donation goes to the oot exhibition glitch
Zfg was my first introduction to the speedrunning community and Ocarina of Time was my favorite game growing up as a kid. Naturally had to get a donation in during the run and let's get that glitch exhibition incentive met!
Long time watcher, first time attendee! My sister and I always make time to watch agdq, and we are always amazed how awesome the runners and crowd are. Super excited to join everyone this year. ZELDA HYPE!
I had to use my Giant's wallet to donate for the Glitch Exhibition.
I don't have much to give this year, but here's to watching ZFG break an amazing game.
I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in November, so this cause hits much closer to home than I'd like. Let's start a $5 donation train while ZFG completely disassembles Ocarina of Time, so that stories like mine become more rare. Choo choo!
Oot glitch exhibition please! Also happy birthday zfg how old are you turning ?
So glad to catch a Games Done quick live, even happier to be donating to a great cause! Let's go ZFG!
OOT was a game I played SOOO much as a kid. But I never did anything as broken as these runners. I'm excited to see this game crushed!
Long time viewer, it's about time I donated. AGDQ is always a great event, and putting the hurt on Cancer ain't bad either. Putting this towards Ocarina of Time Glitch exhibition, it'll doubtless be amazing.
Here's 60 for the glitch exhibition. Let's break this game in half.
First time Zelda, long time Zelda. My Zelda beat Zelda this year, so this cause is close to my Zelda. Good luck on your Zelda, and let's keep up those donations to get rid of Zelda!
My cat's name is Banjo. He appreciates this run. Shout out to ZFG from my cat.
The Legend of Zelda series is one of my speed runs. Good luck to the runners & save the frames!
I LOVE YOU ALL ♥ ESPECIALY YOU, YES YOU ! You are amazing ♥
I always watch OOT at GDQs, and I absolutely love how this game keeps getting more and more broken over the years. I just think it's neat! Have a good run, ZFG!
evil toot
Donating for my good friend Trevor for his upcoming birthday on Friday. Happy Birthday, T-Rev!
First time donator, but a long time watcher of AGDQ. OOT speedrunning is what got me interested in speedrunning in general so I'm glad to be putting money toward a good cause during the OOT run. Put this toward the OOT Glitch Exhibition. Oh, and happy birthday ZFG!
Ocarina defined my childhood and it's crazy to see how much speedrunners have broken this game wide open. Good luck to ZFG!
More OoT run? Son of a ZFG I'm in!
Zelda is cool.
So excited to see my favorite game played in such a unique and awesome way. Definitely worth staying up late to see the whole thing. Good luck on the run! And I guess.. honk!
Save Hyrule ZFG! Good luck!
ZFG is the GOAT-tier OoT speedrunner, and I'm so happy to see him crush another category for a great cause. Let's push for that Glitch Exhibition incentive!
Have to donate during OoT, one of my all-time favorites. Can't wait to see how ZFG will get 100% in 3 hours! Donation goes to getting the Fire Emblem: Three Houses run to support best girl Edelgard and the Black Eagles!
ZFG stands for Zvery Fgood Ggamer. HYPE!! I mean... HONK!!!!
Donating for the second best Zelda game in memory of my mom who loved these games that passed from Cancer this summer.
Thanks so much! Watching ocarina from Australia. Love this every time.
Donating during the Zelda game I sank hours and hours replaying, totally enamered by the story, gameplay and all the little things along the way (SINGING FROGS!) Way to go everyone attending, volunteering and watching AGDQ, here's an idea... let's send the Cuccos after cancer! HONK! (wait, is that right?)
Excited to see zfg break this game in half. Thanks runners, commentators, staff, and volunteers for all you do to make this possible!
Watching Ocarina get torn to bits. One second he’s in Kikori forest, and with no effort he’s at the bottom of the well. I’m impressed with the tricks the community has discovered. Party on dudes.
Hello from Canada eh! I've been watching ZFG's stream while he prepared for NSR for months! Had to donate during the run. Good luck!
Weee wee weeeeeeee!
Long time GDQ watcher, first time donator. This donation is in honor of my friend Charles who was recently diagnosed with cancer. Let's beat this awful disease!And let's make this OOT glitch exhibition happen!
Well well well, finally here playing banjo. Good luck on TACKLING your run! Your twitch chat is here with you, cheering you on, remember you can't blame us for miscounting skullkids now! ANYWAYS, hopefully it wont be run ogre anytime soon!
I'm one of the few lucky ones that's able to say that my dad was able to survive the threat of cancer, thanks to early detection. I can't apologize enough to the ones who can't say the same. Hopefully some day soon we can finally say good riddance to that gross cancer stuff. Good luck, zfg, been a big lurking fan for a while, show me the right way to wrongwarp. ;)Sidenote, I think the world needs an OoT glitch exhibition!
These awesome runs are killing my work productivity and my sleep schedule but killing cancer is way more important. This is dedicated to my mom who is a two time cancer survivor.
You got a Huge Rupee!This rupee is worth a whoppingtwo hundred Rupees!
Hello GDQ world! Long-time fan and first time donor. I'm so happy to be able to listen ZFG's run while driving home. OOT was the game that started my love for video games and I can think of no better person to do a 100% run than ZFG! My I lost both my father back in 2016 and my aunt in 2017 from cancer, so I hope this will help even a little bit for the Cancer Foundation. I'll be sure to donate more when I can. Love the GDQ community! ( donation goes to runner's choice)
I’m so excited to finally be donating at a GDQ event. Thank you everyone for all of the amazing work you do to put it all together. I had to donate during a Zelda game since it’s the best franchise ever! Good luck ZFG! Let’s get that glitch exhibition!
For my Mom who overcame cancer through early detection, surgery and good old fashion stubbornness. Go GDQ!
Go ZFG!
Love the Zelda franchise, specially Ocarina of time. Lost my aunt some years ago and now my uncle is fighting bravely to surpass it. Let's go for that Glitch exhibition and good luck ZFG.All support matters, send some love to GDQ staff and all speedrunners. Thank you!
I work and deal in the collecting side of the video game community, which is a facet of the video game world that is niche and unknown to many. I'm talking games that may trade for 4 and 5 figures every day. But even with the disconnect from the "gaming" in "video games," and with my limited time to enjoy playing classic games, I stay connected to this wonderful universe through runners like ZFG, whose OOT playthroughs were the reason I joined Twitch. His runs keep me going through rough days and he never ceases to amaze in his continued progress of the best game of all time. Keep it up bud, this run is my highlight of GDQ 2020.
last name: donatorfirst name: first timelet's get that glitch exhibition!
Ok but my man Zfg do be looking kinda cute tho. Let's get that glitch exhibition!
Happy birthday ZFG!

Like my favorite pokemon, Aegislash, may we shield others from and take the sword to cancer. Let's get a 10 dollar train going for that OOT Glitch Exhibition.
Have to donate during a favorite game of our childhood! First year married and first AGDQ! Here's to beating cancer; can we get your best "HYAAAAHHH!"?
Hey all greetings from the audience. It's great to see such a different approach to one of my favourite games. On that note, let's get that glitch exhibition!
 (Comment rejected)
Of course I have to donate during a Zelda run, the series I've played since childhood. I want to thank everyone who makes AGDQ possible every year. Keep up the good work!
Always hyped to see the OoT master at work. ZFG is the chillest streamer out there, and I love watching him smash this game apart like Link smashes pots. Best of luck on the run, and thanks to everyone involved with GDQ for supporting such a worthy cause. Let's make this glitch exhibition happen!
Such a nice event and a nice community. Xoxo
Donating during my first and favorite game I ever played on N64. My mind is blown watching ZFG run this game. Many thanks to everyone involved to help benefit an incredible cause!!
I want to thank all the staff & volunteers at AGDQ/PCF for the amazing work they do.Nearly three and a half years ago, and the day before my 24th birthday, I was diagnosed with a rare form of thyroid cancer that had already spread. Thankfully I was able to have surgery and receive radiation treatment from some amazing Doctors at MGH in Boston, and I'm still here today. I'm glad to see how hard PCF works to bring early detection to communities across the world because of how important it is. Donating $100 during one of my favorite childhood games. ZFG is a legend so I'm putting this towards his glitch exhibition.
ZFG, a true master of his craft. Always a blast to watch you play OoT!
All my support for the cancer foundation. respect to all speedrunners for this event. Good luck zfg for your 100% nsr run. You are a true inspiration to the community... Tribute to FrankerZ
ZFG!!!!!!
Thank you to all the runners and everyone at GDQ for putting on an amazing event. for such a great cause., good luck on all your runs!
Thanks for keeping my January in the Midwest interesting while I’m inside staying warm. Excited to be able to watch my favorite childhood game played all while supporting a great cause! Play on!
Anyway...
Will we ever get FrankerZ on B button ever again? Good luck on the run zfg
Long time watcher, first time donator. Shout outs to my wife and my mom. Around November I lost an uncle to cancer, and then the Beginning of December I was diagnosed with a very rare form of cancer. It has been an emotional rollercoaster, but my family has been very supportive. I love speed running and hate cancer so it made sense to donate, especially during a game that defined my childhood. Donation goes to OoT glitch exhibition, because nothing says I love this game like breaking it. Will donate another $20 if the donation announcer does their best Navi impression. Go ZFG!
hey agdq, watching these wacky runs is always gamer's delight. this run is the bombchu. seriously its off the hookshot.thanks.
Honks for ZFG
ZFG said that this game's full of glitches, but it looks to me like it's full of bugs.
This one is for Sent. That goofy son of a gun warms my heart.
Thank you ZFG, the OoT and the Majora's Mask community for keeping my childhood alive. I recently applied to programs in graduate school to study cancer genetics, I want to contribute to this fight to save lives. P.S. I can't believe you missed the forest escape split!
Loving this block of games! Keep up the good work everyone!
This donation is dedicated to my mom, who is a three-time cancer survivor. Let's work toward a future where we can prevent cancer from happening to anybody ever again. Best of luck to ZFG for yet another amazing OoT run from my seat here in the audience. HYA-ONK?!
The Legend of Zelda turns 34 this year, so here are 34 green rubies for my favorite game series! Can I get a "Hey, listen!"?
Zelda speedruns saved my life. Thanks zfg and everyone in the community for all your hard work and contributions.
First time donator watching at home. Thanks to all the runners and staff for putting on such a great event for an even greater cause!
My girlfriends Mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer and is a huge Zelda fan. This donation is for Dawn during the best Legend of Zelda game made, love you and kick cancers butt!
I love Ocarina of Time. It's amazing how far the speedruns have come for this game.
It is always great to see a ZFG run at AGDQ! I am continually amazed at how much these OoT runs change year after year. Let's get that Glitch exhibition!
Donating so we can see that awesome glitch exhibition. Almost everyone in my family has had to fight with cancer and they always come out on top thanks to research into early detection and treatments. Thanks to everyone putting on this amazing event. It means a lot.
Love AGDQ! Cancer took my father in law. Let’s find that cure!
One of my favorite zelda games of all time and always a fun game to watch being speedrun let's get that glitch exhibition everyone
Watching OoT get wrecked is a great way to spend the evening.Let's get that glitch exhibition!
I had to donate during the segment with some of my favorite games--MGS3 and Zelda! Good luck to the runners and thanks GDQ for the awesome event! <3
Link must be a cat because he has so many lives.
Loving the OoT run! Good luck ZFG. pS. HONK!
ZFGesus take the wheel!
Any chance you can do some intentional death/RNG manipulation in Gerudo Valley so we can hear the song a bit longer? Thanks for all the good runs, and looking forward to even more!
Donating in memory of my mother, who died of cancer in November. I'm still hoping that she just did that to skip a cutscene, but I guess I won't be able to found out until my own game is over. She loved the Zelda series, and she would have been really impressed to see some of these shenanigans! Keep up the good work, ZFG, and let's see that glitch exhibition!
Happy to donate durring my favorite game of all time. (Even if I still don't know where everything is) 700k HYPE!!!
ZFG finally running Banjo. Nice. Donating for that Banjo glitch exhibition. Good luck on the run and happy counting.
It's time to cross 700k! Let's go!
Hey everyone, I had to make my first donation during Ocarina of Time. I can't believe this game is still being enjoyed and destroyed in 2020 but here we are. I will donate another $50 if we can get a HONK from the crowd.
We lost my mom, grandma, best friend's dad, a cousin, a friend, and an aunt in the past 3 years to cancer. In honor of Ocarina of Time, the first game my mom ever let me take over the family tv to play, here's my Nintendo $64
 (Comment rejected)
Good luck ZFG <3
I'm always glad to see more Ocarina of Time at GDQ. This game has so many categories and so many glitches that there's always something new to see. Here, take my bi yearly $5.
Oh hey, I know that character from Super Smash Bros. Melee on the Nintendo Gamecube! It's SHEENK!
Still my favorite game of all time. Thanks for doing a 100% run, the best run!
More GDQ! Always more GDQ! Even if it's Animorphs...Even if it's Animorphs...
Long time watcher, long time donator. I was torn over what to donate towards but I finally settled on the Animirphs run.Happy birthday to my friend aers, and watch symphogear.
Beating cancer isn't easy but neither is first try dampe, doesn't mean we shouldn't try.
Greetings from Canada, and shout out to my husband, who introduced me to GDQ! Work has taken me out of town for the week, so although that means this is the first AGDQ in quite a few years that we haven't been watching together at home, we've still been enjoying watching together from our separate locations, and I know he'll be watching during this run from one of his favorite series. Thanks to everyone involved with AGDQ for all that you do--watching these games being run for such an excellent cause is something we look forward to year-round! P.S.--Let's see that Ocarina of Time Glitch Exhibition!
OH NO
Gotta go fast Link, so you can get the Glitch incentive and Bonus Game for Keizaron coming! Hype!
GDQ has been entertaining to watch so far. Shout-out to the runners, commentators, hosts, and staff who make this event possible. Let's kick cancer in the butt! *insert honk here*
Hey! Listen! ... ... ... (long pause) ... ... ... HONK!
Had to donate during this Zelda run. Nothing cooler than seeing a skilled runner completely deconstruct your childhood memories!
Put this towards the glitch exhibition. These glitches in the run are crazy enough, I can't wait to see the exhibition.
Glitch expo hype!
Hi GDQ, this my second time donating on a GDQ and I'm glad to donate towards the glitch exhibition for Ocarina. Let's 'A GO!

Donating 6 dollars for the glitch exhibition. We only need 1000 6 dollar donos to see this great incentive. That's less than 1% of twitch chat viewers donating 6 bucks! Let's do it!
Start that 10 dollar hype trainLet's lock down that glitch expo!
Donating during one of the most iconic speedrun games of all time. OoT was the game that got me into speedrunning, and it will always hold a special place in my heart. This donation is in memory of my Aunt Leslie. F cancer.

Happy Birthday ZFG. I love you.
Had to donate in memory of my grandma who passed away last may from cancer, and had to wait till ocarina of time the first game she ever got me. Hope you have a good run ZFG, and I quickly want to share the last thing my grandma told me, go live your live to the fullest so I hope we can eliminate cancer so everyone can live there life to the fullest
That was just too adorable, I'm just donating for KungFuFruitPanda to say "Hey, Listen!" again. Also, good luck with your run ZFG.

Donating for the Animorphs run because Keizaron deserves to suffer! :D He insulted our favorite Venomoth, ATV the Dragonslayer. Have fun with Animorphs, Keez. <3
Thank you for all that you do.

Donating during one of my all time favorite games in history - Ocarina of Time! ZFG is amazing and I love watching all of the ways this game gets broken. Cheers to all of the runners and staff and the organization! May the Triforce be with you! <3
I am watching this with my mouth hanging open. How do people figure this stuff out?
AGDQ is one of my favorite times of year, and Ocarina is my favorite run. Thanks for everything you do to change lives while entertaining us in the process. My donation this year is in honor of my friend, who lost her mother to cancer last year. Good luck ZFG with the rest of the run, and let's get that glitch exhibition!
Let’s get those glitches exhibited!

Amazing OoT run! Keep it up, ZFG!
This one is for my uncle, who lost his battle with cancer yesterday. More than ever, I so appreciate the GDQ community and all they do to make the world a better place. Now let's unlock those glitches!
Given how casually ZFG is pulling off these tricks, I feel like I need to donate for that glitch exhibition. Plus 51 cents for Dampe.
You thought you could escape me didn't you, but you can't. Mweep Mweep Mweep Mweep Mweep Mweep Mweep
I always enjoy watching The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time speedruns. Seeing these glitches is awesome. Thanks to everyone for making this event possible. Good luck to all the runners.
Hey everyone, I ALSO had to make my second donation during Ocarina of Time. I will donate $100 if we can get another HONK from the crowd.

LONK!
For the exhibition, and for cancer research!!!
Many members of my family have had cancer. Here's to help make sure others don't have to go through the same.
I’m naming my firstborn ZFG based on this awesome run!
First time to catch this live! My wife was diagnosed my thyroid cancer this year, but we caught it early. Great game and great cause. May this run Goron and on!
Had to donate during a ZFG ocarina run, watched a few of your gdq runs live, always super impressed! Great event as always, let's get that glitch exhibition! HYPE
Enjoying watching you break this game over your knee for a good cause
Glitch exhibition and 750k hype!
Good luck and have fun ZFG! Donation for that Triforce blanket and the Ocarina Glitch Exhibition because OOT can't be broken enough.
HONK!

Had to donate during my favorite childhood game, especially if a glitch exhibition is on the line!
Always great to see a classic game dissected so thoroughly!
Huge fan of ZFG. Found him through GDQ, and finally caught him live for once AND on GDQ speedrunning the best game ever. Lets kill cancer and break great games.
Long time watcher, first time donator! Have to give to this great cause and to the speedrun of my favorite game, Ocarina of Time. Don't "Link" or you'll miss it :P
This one goes out to my wife. I love you sweety and I hope you are doing well.
I will always donate for a glitch exhibition. Just thought you should know.
First time donating after watching AGDQ for many years, and very excited to do so! Greetings from Japan!
Much love for the event. I watch it every year with my brothers. The memes, the games, the mistakes. I love it all.Sometimes you just need to yell something for a week...HONK!
Loving this bafflingly cool run so far! Glad to give to a good cause. My mom was diagnosed with cancer recently and early detection has made all the difference in her prognosis. Thanks for all your hard work and good luck ZFG!
I felt like I had to donate during this Zelda run. Zelda is life! I love watching ZFG's runs, and would love to see the glitch exhibition! Good luck on the run!
Had to donate for the guy that I discovered speedrunning through! This is going to the glitch exhibition, it's gonna be soooo worth it.
I’m honor of my aunt who we lost to cancer Thanksgiving day three years ago. Thanks to everyone here at GDQ for this great event and wonderful cause!
Only in Hyrule:Shopkeeper: "I have a magical fairy that'll revive you from the dead and fill all your hearts"Link: "Oh cool"Shopkeeper: "and it comes in a bottle"Link: "TAKE MY MONEY!"What better time to donate than during the OOT 100% no source requirement run. Took me so long to beat this game as a kid, and watching ZFG completely break it along with the great commentary from the couch is a real joy. Thank you to all the runners, commentators and staff for such an amazing event. So great to see so much positivity coming from the speedrun community. Good luck and go fast! 10th anniversary HYPE!
This game made up most of my childhood and I am in awe that it is still relevant and making an impact today. Be it in a very unconviential way. Cheers to ZFG, runners, the GDQ staff, attendees and twitch chat. This event is always an amazing thing. Honk!
Hey ZFG, listen....listen.....listen....listen....listen
I always have to donate during ZFG's runs. You're killing it, man! Keep it up. That Dampe race, though...
This run is totally the bomb-chu. It's off the hook-shot, it totally Octo-rocks and Hy-rules, Easily Deku-oolest we've seen so far tonight. I would have been so Zor..a if i missed it, everyone who isn't watching is gonna be Sari-a tomorrow. Lets all put on our iron boots and kick cancer in the butt!
Heyyy buddy. Sure you don't want to come say hi? I swear you'll get my heart piece first try.
Uh, Banjo? How inconsiderate! How could you leave me behind?! If you're a man, act like one! Take responsibility!
Here is 25$ toward the OFT incentive. I had to donate for one of my favorite games. Keep doing what you do and save the frame.
Good luck ZFG! Donating towards the bonus game because every GDQ needs an Animorphs game!
Ocarina of Time is a TIMEless classic and a LEGENDary entry in it's series.This game helped define Zelda as my favorite video game franchise and seeing it get destroyed this much is amazing. Put this towards the Glitch Exibition because you can never have enough Zelda.
Super excited to be watching this amazing Ocarina of Time run live for the first time. Put this toward the OoT glitch exhibition!
GLITCH PLEASE
Just saying, do you really want to let that 0/1 Score for Animorph stay? I sure dont
AGDQ has been...well...awesome so far! I had to donate during one of my favorite Zelda games. Lets get that glitch exhibition, and HONK!
My son Weston was so impressed when I showed him the blindfolded 2 player/ 1 controller Mike Tyson Punchout he insisted that we donate during Ocarina of Time. Here's $20 for the glitch exhibition.
HONK
Hey! Listen!
Hyah! Hyah , h-h-h-h-hyah!
don’t read this
Thank you ZFG for this amazing run!! Loved all the explanation from you and the couch.
Zelda is on his way ot save the princess!
Never had an n64 growing up but these runs and glitches are always mind blowing. Here's to the glitch exhibition, lets keep working to meet the incentives, and beat cancer together!
Honk honk
Zelda Glitch Exhibition HOOOONK- I mean HYYYPE!
It is 2020. Time for cancer to be left in the past.
OOT is my favorite speedrun game because I loved playing it growing up and I love seeing how far it's been pushed over the years. All the more reason to put this money towards the Glitch Exhibition.
What's your favorite song in OOT?
I recently had preventative surgery to address a cancer risk and am watching this in recovery! Every year this is a wonderful reminder of how powerful we are when we work together towards a goal. Thank you for an incredible run of an incredible classic.
Time for a $5 twitch chat glitch run train? CHOO CHOO!!!
Would some one stop that infernal beeping!
You darn kids and your video games! Get off my lawn!
Proactively giving you 1 dollar for each skulltula you collect! Good luck ZFG!
Hey GDQ! Been watching for a while now and I just wanted to sya thank you for everything you do, and good luck to all the runners! This donation goes towards the glitch exhibition incentive
ZFG is such an AMAZING runner and commentator! Let's get that glitch exhibition!
You guys deserve this donation more than I can express. I have watched this event every year, and each time I find some game or runner which I am glad I learned of. The charity is one that is near to my heart, as I had a aunt pass away due to cancer. Finally, having been born deaf in one ear and lost most of my hearing in my other ear recently, this is one thing that I can still watch and enjoy despite not hearing it very well. Thanks to everyone working behind the scenes who has donated their time and talent to help put on this amazing event for such a worthwhile cause.
Shoutout to my friend Chase, I love you man and thanks for introducing me to this amazing event! ZFG keep up the great run!
In 2018 my mom got diagnosed with cancer and because it was detected on time my mom beat cancer in 2019, Im thankfull that my mom can be here next to me watching my favorite game and my favorite runner
What sound does a goose from Hyrule make? B O N K!
Can't wait to see this OOT Glitch Exhibition! Thank you to all of the runners and behind the scenes staff for putting on such a huge event for such a great cause.
This OoT run has been awesome, what a treat to see all these glitches and ways to break a game I loved to play as a kid!
In memory of Papa. Prevent cancer!
Zelda? Glitches? Animorphs? 710k? Yes please!
Spent my childhood watching my brother play Zelda games, and I’m thrilled to watch ZFG run Ocarina tonight!
Long-time watcher, but finally able to watch it live, and be able to support a great cause. Love to all the runners, and the people who put this event together!
Awesome run! I wish they would use N64 Link's voice in smash bros tbh
This Ocarina of Time 100% No Source Requirement run is mind-blowing. Can't wait to see that glitch exhibition. HYAAAAH!
I want to watch AGDQ 2020 over and over again... < A v < A v
GLITCH EXPO HONK
Let's see that glitch exhibition!
Great job on the run so far ZFG, or as Link would say if he were a goose, HYONK!
I think we're lacking pun so I'm gonna ESSk chat for some more right now. Go ZFGeese!!!
Making my donation for this time around! I'm always happy to contribute to such a great cause and such a great fundraiser.
I wanna see this classic messed up beyond belief! Let's get that glitch exhibition incentive met!
The level to which this game has been broken never ceases to amaze me. Let's make that glitch exhibition happen! I remember one from a couple years ago that blew my mind, and I can't wait to see what else has been found since then. Good luck on the run!
8 years ago my dad and i found GDQ, 6 years ago he fell to cancer. Ever since then i get a feeling that he comes and sit besides me to watch together again. Love and miss you dad!
Hello, I have been watching GDQ events for a few years now, and haven't been able to donate until now. My grandfather turned 75 this year, and asked all of his grandkids, (myself included) to donate to charities of our choice to celebrate. I'm glad I got to donate during one of my favorite games, Ocarina of Time, which is one of the first games I ever played. Thanks for everything you all do. I'm loving watching every second.
The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time was my first Zelda game and I still consider it to be the best in the series. Thanks for the run ZFG. I have loved watching GDQ for around 4 years now and always find it awesome how wonderful our community is. Keep up the great work everyone! I have several aunties who have suffered because of cancer and know that it's one of the worst killers to this day. Let's beat it!
Let's kick cancers butt.
CLG ZFG is so good
Can't believe GDQ is already half over, but I've been loving all the runs so far this week. Shout out to all the runners and let's get that animorph's run in.
So many awesome runs this year. Thanks for your hard work runners and everyone behind the scenes!
Great Job organising the event/fundraising for a great cause. Thank you for explaining in detail all the glitches.
Thanks to everyone at GDQ!
Thanks for the chill games for a good cause!
zfg, we love you! been looking forward to this run for a long time and you're killin it
Hey y'all, I hear you like glitches? Well, Animorphs is basically a million glitches cobbled together into a game, so go donate towards that incentive!
This is for my friend Sam and the way he's persevered against cancer for the past 13 years! I love me some Zelda and couldn't think of a better time to donate.
Happy birthday zfg
My sister and I grew up playing the Legend of Zelda games together so it is awesome to see this game broken! We've been watching AGDQ for years and it is heartwarming to see the community come together for such a great cause. Thanks to all the runners! Honk!
zelda's sheik-sona is really boringly named, but at least he's cool lol. kick gan-cer's butt!!
I've been playing OoT randomizers lately, so I'm accustomed to crazy shenanigans in this game regularly, but not quite this crazy. As a person with arachnophobia, the sound of ~30 skulltulas dying simultaneously was quite cathartic. Thank you ZFG!
We've gotta see Animorphs again, it's the best animal morphing game on the GBA. Let's hope for quick dolphin and good luck with those battles.
One of my best friends, Bam Daradet, sadly lost his uncle early last month to cancer so I wanted to donate in his name during his favorite game, legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. Bam you were there when I lost my dad so just know that you're surrounded by loved ones and with each dollar donated we are one step closer to getting rid of cancer and the pain it creates for families and friends.Love you Fam.CCAAAAAWWWWW!!!!!!!
Here's to Zfg for not only bring a great runner but looking like a clone of my friend Hunter speed on clone speed on
First time donating. Lets get some Animorphs madness coming.
I'm glad I could finally see GDQ in-person after watching online for so many years! Greetings from the event!
Hjonk! [That's quack in Goose!]
Always love to see Ocarina of Time! Great memories playing this game with my sister as a kid. It made me love games forever. Cheers to everyone who makes AGDQ possible! HONK!
I really enjoy this GDQ and especially this Zelda run. Thanks to all runners and the team for raising money for the fight against cancer!
I love the Legend of Zelda series. It's so great seeing all the creative ways GDQ keeps bringing back the same game to be played in different ways!
Can't wait for awful block tonight! But are they really bad games if we're having fun?Donation goes to the Animorphs bonus game - let's make it happen!Shoutout to TielQT, Big Chungus, and Bird School Discord. HOOOOONK!
I want to make keizaron play animorphs lol
I've been having a hard week, and I'm glad I've had AGDQ to give me a little boost. Let's give the Prevent Cancer Foundation a boost to their great work, too!
This donation is in honor of my mother, who passed away due to a rare form of cancer in August after a long 33 month fight. Back during SGDQ 2016, she donated to support me during my Sonic Colors DS run and it was read out on stream, so I thought this would be something fitting to do for her. Thank you, mom.On a less dismal note, putting most of this towards supporting my friend Gyoo in upgrading his The Sun and Moon run to All Bosses. I watched him do a run in the practice room and it is significantly cooler than any% , so it is definitely worth it.
#EniCeleste
Hey there you guys n' gals from GDQ, I have been working alongside a friend in the creation of a new MMORPG and we had received more donations for beta testing than we expected and I felt it was only fair to give back what we can to a good cause. I lost my grandfather to lung cancer when I was a little boy and it was devastating to the entire family but I just want you guys to know that what you are doing is amazing, Let's squash cancer!
Donating for my wife who is watching her first GDQ and whose parents both have cancer. Let's kill cancer and save the frames. Donation goes to Animorphs, the first GDQ run I ever watched. HONK!
The trick we just watched was so complicated, so intricate, that it legitimately sounds like one of those playground 'hacks' we used to hear about as kids, like mew's truck....except this one actually works.
I think I was able to follow the explanation of the new glitch in OOT, but I'm curious about how something like this gets discovered. What is the process for uncovering, firstly, how it works, and then secondly, how to use it practically in a run?
Looking forward to that OoT glitch exhibition!
Thanks again for another great OoT run!
Enjoying the opportunity to show my family their first speed run! Wish I had a better explanation as to why “that boy is running backwards” good luck!!
Sooooo if this is the run, what could possibly be in the glitch exhibition?
First year watching, first year donating! How could you not donate to such an amazing event for a great cause! Good luck with the rest of the run!
GDQ is always a great way to start the year and I'm always happy to donate to PCF. Save the people! (and the frames)
 (Comment rejected)
Been looking forward to seeing the new OoT route at GDQ and turned the TV on just in time to see the new trick! Good luck ZFG.
Love AGDQ! My aunt is a breast cancer survivor and we lost my grandpa to cancer 11 years ago. Such a great cause!
Speedrunning is best running.
Lost my Grandmother to Cancer in 2018 so here's to helping fight the good fight!
Hey! Listen!
Donating for this absurd boomerang glitch in OoT. My brain was long ago melted when ZFG said "and that's the end of phase 1" 🤯
Hi
I hope I made this donation on the exact right frame to help cure cancer. Donation goes to runner's choice of HONK!
Animorphs is what brought me to the GDQ and Keizaron. So I'll NOT let this run to never happen again!ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS ANIMORPHS
Can't wait for this Cadence of Hyrule run. Awesome game with awesome music! Also, let's get this Animorphs run!
Love watching speedruns especially Zelda!Thank you to organizations like the Prevent Cancer Foundation, who helped my Dad, who was very sick remove something that would have turned into cancer 30 years ago! Looking forward to the glitch Exhibition!!!!!Honk!!!! Listen!!!!!
Thanks, ZFG. Now my brain hurts. HONK!
Congrats zfg1!
You’re all great
Good luck streamers!
I used to think this game was about the tri force, now I know it's about bottles, bombs, and... whatever that zelda letter treasure chest glitch was.
These glitches are incredibly interesting! When you have time, can you explain why Zelda‘s Letter specifically has that angular functionality compared to other items?
All I can ask is why not just change the character model while you are at it? Amazing how much more broken this game can get after all these years. Good luck on the rest of the run.
You're doing a great job ZFG! From a couple fans from Rhode Island
I said I'd donate again if Zelda's Letter GIM went smoothly, so here's me following through. Thanks to everyone who helps put on this event, and good luck to ZFG on the rest of the run. P.S. This doesn't count as playing Banjo.
You guys just broke my brain.
What even is happening right now?OOT run is so full of amazingly complicated glitches that ZFG pulls off so easily!Excited to see the glitch exibition as well!
Honk!
Happy birthday Steve! You seemed way more excited for agdq than your birthday and I'm happy to spend the day watching it with you.
After years of playing this game with my siblings, seeing this run brings back wonderful memories. My mother is currently 9 years in remission for melanoma. So happy to be part of this experience with you all <3
That was absolutely amazing to see live in this setting! I think I almost kinda slightly understand how that glitch works now. Good job zfg
Hey Listen! I was Linking it would be bomb to hit 800k by the end of the Zelda run. So if you can open your wallets, uncork your Bottles, and show how big your hearts are. Let's show cancer who rules the castle!
That moment when you ask for regular OOT 100% but get diet 100% instead. NSR is such a great run, go ZFG!
Here's $100 for the NSR 100% run. Good luck ZFG!

Never thought I'd see MissingNo. in a Zelda game. Awesome run zfg!
Nephew had leukemia and just was cleared as being cancer free this past year! I hope we blow the top off this donation ceiling! Thank you AGDQ! Zelda GOAT!
My girlfriend and I have been watching for 2 years and finally are able to donate! We wanted to make sure to donate during the OoT run! ZFG is god. HONK
I'm proud of all of you guys. Beat cancer while playing videogames. I love you all. Greetings from Uruguay, South America.
Ocarina of Time was a huge part of my childhood growing up and its always great to see it ran.
As my friend aptly put it, "you could write a PhD dissertation on this game and how broken it is." Good luck on the rest of the run ZFG, and great job on mic Kungfu!
I've been watching GDQ for a few years now, but last year I lost my father to melanoma. It was over 20 years ago now that he bought me an N64 and Ocarina of Time for Christmas, and so I figured a donation during this great OoT run was appropriate. Best of luck with the rest of the run ZFG
Ocarina of Time was a gift from a friend back in grade school. I played it a lot whenever I visited his house and he gave me the cartridge before he moved away. I named the file name after him as something to remember him by. Here's $10 to cover Link's medical bills from all the intentional damage.
Animorphs? Sure, why not. Or... why?
The Legend of Zelda is cool and all, but let's get some hype for that Super Hydlide run!
No matter how often I see ZFG do a run, it never quits being amazing. His skill plus the knowledge of the couch is making this my favorite run of the event thus far.
I am of the belief that no human being on Earth is better at any game than ZFG currently is at OOT. And until anyone pulls off an exhibition of that magnitude in front of a GDQ audience with less than 3 weeks practice, you won't be changing that belief.
GDQ is always the highlight of my January. Go speedrunners!
To Bradley, the best father to our children, Zelda and Anakin. ”AS A REWARD… I GRANT MY ETERNAL LOVE TO YOU“
Animorphs on the Game Boy Color? I'm ready for dat moose!What up ZFG! Congrats on another AGDQ from your boy Ronnie The Bear, Zoomacroom, The King Oop Smack, and Mr. Bovine Joni. And as we say on the OoT discord, get those rupes and scoot!
Hey! Listen! Keep it up guys. Will be donating every year.
If only GDQ had raised a dollar for time I've heard the OOT pause buffer song...oh, wait they have raised 22 million+...sounds about right
 (Comment rejected)
My boyfriend of 5 years encouraged me to start streaming, and this was the first game I played on stream. He was my #1 supporter, and he just passed away a few weeks ago from leukemia, so it would be crazy not to donate tonight. Thank you so much for all you guys do to contribute to such a worthy cause.
What is Deku Tree's favorite Zelda title?Zelda - Ocarina of Time Tree-D!
Amazed by ZFG’s glitch skills! Keep up the good work!
Keep up the great work! Sending lots of love from Seattle <3
Hey guys I'm so excited to be catching the Ocarina of Time run live! I hope Honk!! Doesn't grow up too fast!
I remember being amazed when it was discovered that you could warp to the top of Ganon's Castle from the Deku Tree. And now my mind is being blown watching all the item duplication from the Deku Tree yet again. Excellent job to ZFG for the mind-bending run!
Let's get a train going for Animorphs HONK
I had to donate during Ocarina of Time! Loving the runs this year and everyone is really awesome for doing this!!!! Let's get the Animorphs incentive met!!!
I know what you were thinking when you beat TwinRoba ZFG. Greetings from a couple of fans from Sonora, Mexico. We basically share weather with you my dude.
Such a grand showing of practice, skill, and research. Go ZFG go!
Always love watching games done quick. This year I get to watch it with DaGirl!
This LoZ run is great. But I can't help but feel we are being short-sighted. How have we not completed the Animorphs incentive yet?! Wahh and/or Honk!
amazing speed runs, great cause, shut up and take my money.
What a run! All these great setups, so why not do a setup of our own? How about one of those $5 donation trains when the timer hits 2 hours a 5 minutes. Let's see how much we can raise before the end of this run!
Since my son's name is Link and this game is his namesake I can't think of a better time to donate! Here is to hoping he will see a cancer free world!
As the twin rova famously said in their beaitiful voices: Hiatus! Hiatus! Hiatus! Hiatus! Hiatus!
5 $5 donations for $5 train. GDQ HYPE!!!!
GDQ is always a great event, glad I could donate this year. Let's get Animorphs unlocked! And is it too late to donate for Pokémon? My favorite one is Slowpoke.
You all do an amazing job every year
My Grandfather recently went into remission. Thanks to GDQ for helping to make success stories like this a reality. Good luck ZFG! And I can't wait for Link to get some really cool tattoos.
I LOVE GDQ!!!!!!!!!!
Hey chat, your favorite forest ranger wants to see if you'll jump on this 5$ train with me. Let's get to 1 million!
My boyfriend and I have been watching ZFG since before we got together, so I guess you're kind of responsible for us? You killed it on the memory manip glitch, keep on keepin on! Stoked for the glitch exhibition! P.S. Pay Dry.
I've seen a lot of OOT runs, but I've never seen one where you beat the water temple and leave the lake empty!
Cheers from Bloodlust
Thanks for all of the awesome explanations zfg!
Shoutout to my friend Alexander. Dare you to match my donation.
No matter how many times I watch OoT speedruns, I'm always amazed! Nice work, ZFG! This donation is in honor of my incredible aunt who passed away from breast cancer a few years ago. I love you, Aunt Linda! Donation goes to runner's choice!
 (Comment rejected)
I see an Ocarina of Time speedrun! I love this game so much! If Link can beat Ganon, surely we can beat cancer!
smash cancer into dust
I've been watching GDQs since 2016, where I watched the Zelda runs and the Metroid runs. And I've watched every year since then. This is my first time donating! Here's to GDQ for supporting great causes. And here's to a good run in OoT. And I put my donation to runners choice.
I have so much love for the Zelda speed running community. Watching Oot was what got me into speed running. Seeing all the donations going toward such a good cause I can't help but get a little emotional. I just am sad I won't be able to watch it all the way through. Good luck and much love guys. Keep up the good work. runner's choice
To ZFG1 : it's litteraly the first time I see a speedrun of you doing OoT. You blowed my mind with the whole boomrang trick ! You are a god amongs man! Gratz!
OOT was my first Zelda game and one of my favorite to watch run. I'm so glad I got to catch it live AND donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. My grandma passed away from pancreatic cancer two years ago, so I'm so happy to donate to this charity.
Awesome run of an awesome game for an awesome cause by the awesome ZFG with the awesome FUFU! I’m a “previvor” of cancer so this touches my heart. Keep up the good work and thanks to all involved!
thats wassup
Hey, listen! Hey! Hey! Listen! Hey!
All aboard the Animorphs train!
Big fan of the event. Keep up the good work
First time donating. Good luck to ZFG, and to all involved from The Couch, Twitch Chat and The Dono Reader: You're breathtaking and I'm glad you're here.
5$ train hype!
Ocarina is one of my favorite games of all time. Always love seeing just how broken it really is. Keep up the great work!
Loving this OoT run, and I can't wait for the glitch exhibition. Legend of Zelda HYPE!
chat%
Love finding out new things about Ocarina of Time, one of my top favorite Zelda games. Keep up the good work, everyone!
Love Zelda, able to catch you all Live :) good luck for it is dangerous to travel alone so take my rupees to beat Ganon!

Donating for the first game my brother and I beat as kids. Ocarina of Time has a special place in my heart, and it's great seeing all the different ways it can be broken
Love you ZFG!
Been watching for years, glad to finally donate. Here's to all the runners and please keep the love in the community
Loving this OoT run. Let's start a $5 hype train to meet that Animorphs incentive. Kill the frames, save the Animorphs!
Helping out to get some of those fun Awful Block incentives met, especially Animorphs!
Amazing Ocarena of Time run. You break that game!!!
LONK
There's nothing quite like the beautiful elegance of N64 Zeldas being methodically deconstructed piece by piece. Bravo ZFG, bravo!
Hey, listen! We gotta kick cancer's butt! Donating for Animorphs and because ZFG is the MVP of OOT for...real-e-e...?
Hey zfg. Love the run, love the game, shoutout to my boy Danny on the couch. Keep it up and let's stop cancer before it starts!
Let's Do Animorphs
zfg is probably the speed runner I have watched the most. Happy to donate during his run here at agdq. Keep up the good work. Also putting this to the animorphs run because I read all those books as a kid and didn’t even know there was a game!
Home just in time to see this route finished for the last time before it gets obliterated!
After being friends online for years, I met the love of my life in person for the first time at AGDQ 2019 exactly one year ago today. For that and so, so many other reasons, thank you to the staff, volunteers, runners and amazing communities that come together to make this event what it is. Happy GDQ all, stay safe, stay hydrated and be kind to each other. <3
My wife is a cancer survivor, and early detection is the reason she’s in my life. I’m honored to donate to this very important cause, because without vital technologies like early detection, I wouldn’t have met the best person to ever come into my life. Thank you, and let’s get that Animorphs bonus game met!
Hey AGDQ, I've have always missed my chance to donate but thankfully that streak ends today. My mom is currently going through chemo and I wish there was something I could do to help her. If helping to defeat her cancer wasn't an option the next best thing was help the people helping her. Thanks for everything you all are doing !
Awesome to see a Rando streamer switch to speedrunning the vanilla game, way to go ZFG!!
xD
This is for Chris and anyone else who was scarred by the weirdly dark Animorphs TV series; let's get that GBC run with Keizaron! Donating during OoT because it was the game that got me into speedrunning about 6 AGDQs ago. You're doing beautifully ZFG! Thanks and love to all involved.

We NEED to see the glory that is the animorphs run. Let's make it happen chat.
Love ZFG runs. He always has great interesting content and says it in a clear concise manner. Wonder what he is gonna do in 2020.
Thank's for an awesome gqd as always guys, wanted you guy's to see if it was possible to add Sonic's Mask to the roster of games in the future and good luck to beating cancer with donations as always.
Been watching for a few years now, and I enjoy the stream every time! Loving this OoT run <3
Honk Honk Lonk
I always wait for this part of GDQ, as it's my absolute favorite. Glad to see ZFG at it again.
Thanks for the entertainment!. Let's beat cancer together!
So cool to see all the love and effort the speedrunning community has put into this timeless game. Have a good run, ZFG!
Great run ZFG. Remember drink water :) Let's get the Animorphs run!
I just had to donate during one of my favorite childhood games!
Hype!!!
This blindfolded ocarina of Time run is something else.
This event always means a lot to me, as I’ve both lost and almost lost family members to cancer. Making great entertainment for hundreds of thousands to enjoy, like ZFG and couch are now, while also helping to prevent cancer is amazing. Great job utterly destroying OoT!
Spawning all those skullkids!? I don't trust it. I think you're leading Link toward a terrible fate...Living this run and thanks for an amazing GDQ!
A dollar for every heart piece! Yay for GDQ!
I don't know whats going on anymore so here's $50 for Animorphs
This donation is in memory of my younger sister Lauren, who passed away from cancer 6 months ago at the age of 24. Her battle lasted only 3 months. She was not a particularly avid gamer, but OoT was one game she did play, and in fact she had a replica ocarina, which I now keep in my game room. Thank you PCF and GDQ for the work you do in helping prevent this awful disease. We love you Lauren!
I absolutely love how broken this game is.
"I'm going to need the audience's help on this one. Okay. Hey ZFG. Knock knock."(who's there?)"The interrupting goose."(the interrupting goo-)"HONK!"
Been looking forward to this run all week and had to donate! As someone who just beat Ocarina for the first time today watching you bamboozle the water temple was sweet revenge!
I have to teach grade 2 in the morning but I can't pull myself away from this Ocarina Of Time run! I see lots of coffee in my future!
I lost my best friend to cancer not long ago, so I couldn't not donate for this great cause, and what better time than this amazing OT run! I am left speechless by ZFG's skill. Sending virtual hugs to everyone. Lucas, I miss you bud.
Greetings from the crowd! Always wanted to try Zelda speedrunning, and watching this ridiculous speedrun makes makes me want to even more! Also just wanted to say it's my first GDQ in person, and this community has shown so much kindness. It's so great to see so many like-minded people having fun and being themselves, all for the sake of helping out those who need it. Keep being excellent to each other, it makes the world a brighter place :)
Best way to start the year. Thanks to all the GDQ runners and staff. Take my rupees
ZFG is unreal!
*HONK*
I know $5.00 isn't much, but I just learned from a fellow student our sensei Dr. Waggener just died from cancer. If I could get an Osu from the crowd it,did mean the world to me and my fellow students.
Love this game more than any other, especially with the new texture pack. Great strats by the best runner. Keep it up!
Watching ZFG play Ocarina is a trip. I have never been so excited to be so completely confused by what I'm witnessing.Donation goes to ZFG's choice!
It never ceases to amaze me just how incredibly broken OoT has become. It seems like a plethora of new tricks come out every GDQ. Can't wait to see what else the future holds for this game!
I thought the glitch exhibition was after the run? How is this NOT the glitch exhibition?!
*don't say this bit* *say this in an excited manner* Yipee! Thanks again AGDQ, good luck with fighting cancer and getting as much as you can donated.
Looks like all of the shenanigans has made a glitch in the Matrix!
There's SNAAAAAAAAAAAKE, and then there's HOOOOOOONK. But where is my OOOOOOOOOOORBs at?
Get the hearts doing the dampe valentine challenge next!
Hey all! I look forward to my birthday month every year just for this! Iv been watching since 2014 and this is my first time donating! Love you all and be safe!AND REMEMBER, ITS GAMING WEEKEND!
HONK
ZFG is a god for this run! I just hope link gets better after this run and we can keep kicking cancer's butt!
The glitches in the skybox textures are giving this run bigger "OMG THE WORLD IS ENDING" energy than Majora's Mask could ever dream of. Donating for the Fire Emblem: 3 Houses to be Black Eagles, because EDELGARD DID NOTHING WRONG.
This donation is dedicated to P, who gives more than he gets and is a constant inspiration to be everything that I can be. Thanks AGDQ volunteers, staff, and viewers, and thanks Prevent Cancer Foundation for making this world a better place.
This OoT run is one for the ages. So cool to see the confluence of the hard work from so many community members with ZFG's insane game knowledge and technical skill. Shoutout to Jodermeister if he's watching this!
Glad to be able to donate during a run of Ocarina of Time, one of my favorite games, while also putting my money toward another legendary Animemes run from Keizaron. Thanks for the great lineup, AGDQ! :^)
Adult Link's leggings are now made of 101% authentic dalmatian fur! Either that, or Animorphs has started early...#shavetheanimals
My partner is watching this, I love her so much and I can't wait to be her wife.

Thoroughly enjoying this Ocarina of Time run, thank you to the staff and runners that make this event possible :)
Since we named Link Banjo, can we get some real Banjo?
Hey GDQ! I'd like to give a shout-out to my best friend, Laur, and her brother, Andy, who was battling stage-two cancer last year. I love you lots, Laur, and I can't wait to see you next week!
ANIMORPHS!
This is not the game I knew as a kid. GREAT RUN!
Hey Link! Hey Listen! Honk!
The first game I ever watched a speedrun of, long long ago, was Ocarina of Time. The strats have really changed since then, huh. But there is still an ocarina...and time...I guess. Amazing run ZFG!
All the sprinkles all over these OoT textures make me want ice cream.
My Fiance got me into ADGQ 3+ years ago. We make a point to watch and donate every year and really enjoy the speed runs. We are planning on getting married in October and I can't wait to spend every year for the rest of our lives watching and donating to ADGQ! Thank you everyone who participates in such a great cause.
HEY LISTEN!!!! Go Black Eagles!
Love seeing these long Zelda runs at GDQ! Nothing like staying up and seeing such amazing speedrunning for such a great cause. Thanks to all involved. Go ZFG!
Thank you for introducing me to speedrunning, ZFG!
Zelda Hype! I've been looking forward to this all week. Thanks GDQ for doing your thing!
I just had to donate during one of my favorite game series of all time. I lost both my grandfathers and my aunt to cancer and my mother is recovering from it. I hope this donation will help other people survive like my mom did.
Skull Kid's decorating skills are top notch; he made all of Hyrule glitter a bit more.
I wish Navi could say something different, like "Howdy!"
First paycheck at my job, and that means my first donation to AGDQ! I love what you guys do and how you do it, and I've watched for a long long time. And now it's time for me to give back!
Everything looks horrible and I hate it. Thanks for making this game look like utter garbage. Jk, I am having a great time watching this, keep it up!
I have never seen anything like this with zelda 64 before. kudos and godspeed
Walter P. Engine is the best, Go Dads really don't know anything about DNS at all.
I don't know exactly what's going on, but everything looks legit.
Show feet
Giving some rupees to get some sunblock for those carpenters before they end up with skin cancer!
OOT took me 6 months to beat the first time. I was 8 yr old in 1998 when I got it for Christmas. Very happy to watch ZFG live destroying this game.
How do I get this texture glitch irl? What a beautiful run. Great job all
If you're wondering how it feels: Itchy. Very, VERY itchy.
Donation train for animorphs! Choo choo!
Ocarina of Time was my first game I played on N64, which I really enjoyed playing. I'm so impressed on how this game is beaten 100%. I really enjoyed AGDQ. It is such an amazing event. Keep up the good work! Honk Honk!
Animorphs train hyyyype!
i love u zfg cancer dumb
Greetings from Aersia! Let's roll to the cure!
Over 20 years these ocarina songs have been stuck in my head. Thanks for renewing them with this amazing OOT run. Great job ZFG!
Loving this run! Donating for Animorphs train!
Great commentary and explanations by ZFG and the couch. Thanks to everyone for donating their time to support this cause!
Always happy to watch and donate to a wonderful cause! My first speeds in memory is watching Runnerguy beat OOT 100% at AGDQ 2013, and I've been hooked ever since, watching now with my lovely girl, who's also become hooked! Keep doing what you guys do! Also, Happy birthday ZFG!
First time donating, and when better than when watching my favorite Zelda game get completely broken.
My mom passed away from stomach cancer shortly after Ocarina of Time came out, and playing the game helped me cope, so it feels special to donate to this great cause during the OoT run. Thank you to everyone involved in making AGDQ such an awesome event!
I love AGDQ and all runners thanks for the best entertainment i`ll get all year and before i forget it, Honk
Hello from the second couch! I am honored to be here to witness this awesome Cadence of Hyrule race with the NecroDancer community to help fight cancer.I'm Oof for Goof!
Let's go Goof and Spooty! If one of you does something really spicy, I'll donate another 50$.Winner's choice for the incentive.<Read during Cadence of Hyrule>
 (Comment rejected)
Animorphs is such a beautiful hot mess of a run i just had to donate for it!
For Marissa
Thank you AGDQ for 10 incredible years of games! One of my friends is currently in remission from breast cancer and I'd like to support her any way I can, including donating to support the research of cancer. Please put this money towards the Animorphs run. Looking forward to the rest of the event!
Enter Comment Here...Wait
Always nice to see new OoT glitches.
What a great OoT Run by ZFG. This man is playing Ocarina of Time Like Neo is seeing the Matrix. Absolutely Mindblowing! Watching the Events since 2013 and Always enjoying it. My Moms Most favorite Game was Always Zelda so i keep my Tradition of donating during the Zelda Run. She passed away a few years ago due to cancer. I miss you Mom. Much Love and Greetings from Düsseldorf :)
What better way to ring in the new decade than de Cadence of de Hyrule! From a fellow beat-keeper.
Loved watching a childhood favorite of mine get completely wrecked! Thanks and keep up the amazing work.
I've thoroughly enjoyed watching past runs involving SpootyBiscuit, so I'm looking forward to the Cadence of Hyrule race all the more knowing he's one of the runners for it! Honk!!
ANIMORPHS!
i've always loved keizaron's runs and want nothing more than to watch him play animorphs
I'm rooty for Spooty!
Donating to Keizaron can live his best life by playing Animorphs.
I wanna see that Animorphs run! Here's another $10 toward that end.
roncli can't stop THIS 157!Good luck on the run Spooty!
Had to donate during my favorite streamer. Thanks for such an entertaining run and as always for such amazing explainations for all the tricks. Donation to what should be a great animorphs run!
Donating for my grandmother that passed from cancer, and my other grandmother that has beat breast cancer twice. Keep it up GDQ and love what you all do. No one is as amazing as you guys.
I had to bid on this blanket! Doug is the best <3!
For the doggos!
<3
5 bonks = $50. There is no honk, there is only...BOOOOOONK
Loving the glitch exhibition, who knew that GDQ stood for Good Dogs Quick
[this donation is from the cadence of Hyrule racing community staff -- would love if it could be read as close to the start of the run as possible (ideally last) <3]Greetings from the CoNDOR/CaHOOT crew! Love from Elad, Cancel, Autoclaves, Asher, Alexis, Jakk and Mac. We're rooty for Spooty and raising the roof for Goof! Thanks both of you for your positivity and support over the years -- we couldn't ask for two better ambassadors to represent the Necrodancer/Cadence of Hyrule community. Caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw caw va by the way, please pet the dog. Donation to winner's choice
The Ocarina of Time run has destroyed my mind, so I want to share the love by helping get the Animorphs run on to the schedule.A big thank you to all the staff and runners who've helped make this an amazing event!
Hello from the second couch! I'm super proud of both of you and cant wait to see what you both bring to the table. My donation is going to the winner's choice. Now let's watch these two kick cancer off the dance floor!
ZFG's glitch expeditions are always amazing and make my brain mush. Thanks to him and everyone that makes this possible. Donation goes to that Animorphs run because IT'S MORPHING TIME! Wait... That's not right...
Hoot Hoot! I’m donating some money toward Animorphs. I saw the failed run a few years back and need to see it cleared.Did you want me to repeat what I just said?* YES* NO
Had to donate during my all-time favorite gaming series! The glitch exhibition with the puppy dance party was supremely awesome! It's so fascinating to see OoT dissected in such a way by the wonderful runners. My grandmother beat lung and breast cancer, and my uncle just beat prostate cancer. Cheers to everyone involved in this event, and keep on honking!
Ocarina of Time is one of my favorite games of all time, and the game that got me hooked on the Zelda series. I loved ZFG's run and am looking forward to the Cadence of Hyrule run. Now if only Cadence of Hyrule would get a physical release, right Nintendo and Brace Yourself Games? *hint* *hint* *wink* *wink* *nudge* *nudge*
Go Spooty and Goof! Seeing Necrodancer on GamesDoneQuick got me into Necrodancer Racing, and I hope this race will inspire others to give rhythm roguelike racing a try! Donation goes to Animorphs, because one of these days I'll read those books and understand what my wife is talking about.
Had to get in before this amazing Zelda OOT run ends. Goes to runners choice.
All Dogs Go To Hylia!
Watching with my partner who I recently introduced to Fire Emblem and she loves it! money is going toward Black Eagle route
So excited to be here in the audience for Cadence of Hyrule. Good luck Spooty and goof! Also happy birthday Charlie!
Been looking forward to the Cadence of Hyrule all week! Also wanted to say hi to my friend MooMoo on the couch!
Come on Lion!!
I'm rooty for Spooty and I'm oof for Goof!
Had to donate. I've watched for years and wanted to donate during the zelda games.
Yay AGDQ!
Great OoT run, really looking forward to Cadence of Hyrule next. Best Zelda game of last year by far!Putting towards the Golden Deer for tomorrow's FE3H run!(If the GDQ site adds numbers to my name ignore them, it's simply TheMasterDS)
Zelda? Mega Man? Beating Cancer? I'm in!
lets get that animorphs run in!
Just want to remind the runners to get Cactus Skip. Shoutouts to the Necrodancer community.
Here's to BEATing cancer, and may the bats be ever in your favor.
That was one awesome glitch exhibition! I wish we coule also pet the dog
Hey Spooty and Goof, CloudMax here!Woke up 5.30 here in Sweden to catch the run and show my support.Here's hoping that Spooty get some half-decent RNG on Ganon for once, and that Goof is able to locate desert.Good luck!
I look forward to this every year. Thanks to all the staff for making this amazing event possible. And thanks to all the Runners for.... HONK!
I got so excited for the upcoming Cadence of Hyrule run that I've gone through at least two playthroughs this week! Keep up the great work guys!
ACE on an N64? OOT Glitch Exhibition just blew my mind... which was already blown after ZFG's crazy run! Thanks to all who make GDQ happen, and let's kick cancer to the curb!
Merci LFR pour votre travail ! Des gros bisous ! #IsaacLou
Love all the runs!!! keep up the great work!!!!
Need to see Keizaron attempt another Animorphs run to kick off Awful Block. Favorite segment of the marathon each year.
Animorphs was the run that really got me hooked on GDQ so I have to donate for it. Go Keizaron! Morph those animals!
Looking MAD forward to that Mega Man relay race! Let's jump and shoot our way towards a world without cancer!
Looking forward to more Super Hydlide! Let the frames begin. No, seriously, let them begin, I haven't heard of Super Hydlide having any frames yet.Shoutout to Shard Warband!
Extended my holiday from work for this event. I cannot stress the amount of enjoyment my wife and I get from watching every year. I live hundreds of miles and many years from my childhood and GDQ gives me the opportunity to visit again. Thanks for the awesome experience and for working towards and amazing cause.
Let's get that ANIMORPHS!
Stoked for Cadence of Hyrule. Thanks for a great event for an excellent cause!
#teaseKeiz
That glitch exhibition was amazing and literally pulled out the money from my bank account. Puppies Everywhere!! Thank you to ZFG for that amazing run, and all the runners for their effort and commitment to this great cause. Also, 25 dollar train anyone?
Bravo aux autres survivants de la nuit et bonjour aux nouveaux ! Bonne journée ou bonne nuit et bourrez les dons !#DarkMage
Everybody on camera is beautiful!
Animorphs HYPE!
The glorious train wreck that is Animorphs needs to be seen.
Keizaron! Keizaron! Keizaron!
more awful block plzalso, poyo :3
Let's start off everyone's night by absolutely ruining this marathon! Let's get Animorphs in!
Awful Block never disappoints, so I've GOT to see this Animorphs run. Good luck to all the runners.
Lets go Awful Games block, Lets get that Animorphs!
Here's to getting Animorphs to happen! Shout outs to everyone that witnessed the absolute disaster that the Game Boy Color version of Animorphs, truly one of the funniest runs in GDQ history. Go Keizaron go!
Shout out to simpleflips. Animorphs get.
We can't tell you who we are. Or where we live. It's too risky, and we've got to be careful. Really careful. So we don't trust anyone. Because if they find us...well, we won't let them find us.The thing you should know is that everyone is in really big--***HOOOOOONK***DANG IT MARCO KNOCK IT OFF
#TeaseKiez! You heard it from Edobean! Let's go and start a new train! $5, $10, anything for PCF!
Second donation of the event! Hello everyone!
Hi
If we want to make the Awful Block longer, we're going to have to increase the Cadence of donations.
GDQ weeks are such great highlights of the year. This one has been exceptional to watch. Thanks for making them such a good time and giving us all a chance to donate to a great cause at the same time.
WE LOVE YOU GOOF AND SPOOTY!!!
The biggest question is, will Goof do an Oof, or will Goof do a win?
Animorphs? Heck to the yes! Can't wait to see it. Thanks AGDQ! You guys do such a great job and for a cause!
 (Comment rejected)
Couldn't wait to donate during Cadence of Hyrule! SpootyBiscuit is the first speedrunner I've followed outside of GDQ, and copying some of the strats he uses has really improved my time. I finally made a leaderboard for the first time while waiting for this run to start (fixed beat/seeded). It only took me 2 hours and 37 minutes!! Thanks for the inspiration and good luck on your run SpootyBiscuit and Goof! Oh yeah, and eff cancer!
For SpootyBiscuit,(read the following in an excited voice) Kyle, Kyle, oh my goooooooood!!!!!!With love from Lafayette, Louisiana, and shoutouts to Maidens of the Kaliedoscope and Team Alternative Ending. Also, I didn't think that the "Group tour starts here" sign would work that well...
This is AGDQ! Our volunteers POINT and CLICK Technical Difficulties. They're simply the best!
Thanks to all the runners. Putting in towards joining the Black Eagle house in Fire Emblem: Three Houses because Edelgard was right. Down with the nobility. Down with cancer.
Shoutout to the crowd for supplying so much energy and love during all the runs and breaks! I also want to see that animorphs run happen! Let's do it!
pls no more honking
Moar awful games!
ready for these awful games done quick! lets get animorphs!
I wish any of the animorphs turned into a goose... HONK!
Une bonne run de Cadence of Hyrule pour se réveiller le matin et vive Ariane ! #IsaacLou
Awful block wouldn’t be right without Animorphs
I miss Keizaron. His Jynx cry should be a donation incentive, if nothing else!
Thanks to everyone who helped make this possible!
Seriously you need to see the animorphs run! 125% is a big mess and who doesn’t wanna see keiz deal with a big mess?!
Animorphs is love, Animorphs is life, Animorphs must happen!
I hope everyone knows just what a trip watching Keizaron run Animorphs for Gameboy Color is. It is sublime. It is staring straight into the deepest abyss of terrible RPG design. We cannot miss this.
I've always been a fan of GDQ and donated a little each year, but now it's personal. In the past year I've had two family members diagnosed with cancer. The support pouring in for a good cause at times like this gives me hope. Stay strong and stay healthy, all of you!
My wife and I love watching these events! Thank you everyone for participating and donating!
I'm going to bed but I wanna see Animorphs on VOD later!
Have to donate during Cadence of Hyrule, such a great game with such a stellar soundtrack, best of luck on the run and lets get that animorphs run funded!!!!!!
Edo Bean please read my poem!!A limerick from my heart to all of you.Oh what a week for the flu.Stuck in bed watching AGDQ.I cough and I sneeze,And also I wheeze,but thats from laughing and cheering with you.
I'm fairly new to even just watching speedrunning in general, but it was a gdq run of Cuphead that was my introduction to this community. I think its incredible that so much money can be raised for a good cause and be so entertaining at the same time! Thank you so much for the good you do, and for introducing me to speedrunning!
Let's see that Animorphs run!
Donating because I want to hear Mike Uyama say "It's a joke!" over and over.
Good luck goof & spooty, but I don't think you need it
me want animorphs. also bless Mike Uyama
Are we going to see Cactus Skip live on GDQ? I heard it's extremely difficult to pull off! Good luck guys and shoutouts to CoNDOR!
Well, this IS a birthday gift! AGDQ and Candace of Hyrule in my special day? Sign me in! Here's a dollar for every birthday i shared with this amazing cause through the years. Thank you for this and for being so AWESOME on what you do!I'll donate another 10 if anyone can sign as the shop keeper of Crypt of the Necrodancer for at least 5 seconds. Love you!
Shout out to my buddy Ken Chong aka pleocavee. You wanna know something about yourself that maybe you don't know?!
I'm donating during this run because the necrodancer/cadence community is one of warmth and inclusion, and its acceptance of folks of all race, gender, and orientation should be celebrated.This donation is in honor of my friend Hans. We went to high school, and debate camp together. We ended up at college together. One day, in the middle of an Econ lecture, I got a phone call from Hans: He had gone, on a whim, for one of those psych study MRIs. They pulled him out immediately and told him they couldn’t use him for the study: he had a brain tumor. We don’t know when, or if, he would have been diagnosed otherwise; this unplanned visit saved his life. Early detection matters. And I’m honored to contribute just a little in his name to the Prevent Cancer Foundation.Hans had close to a decade cancer free, but now, he has been in an out of treatment. I’m grateful for the time he’s had, and hope everyone listening takes a moment to wish him well in his treatment now and think of the moments, the lives, they can save, through contributing to early detection and treatment.With Love, Troy
Really excited to donate during one of my favorite games of the year. Good luck to both the racers, let's see that cactus skip!
Beatdown Cancer to the BEAT! Go Spooty and Goof, you guys are insane and thank you to AGDQ for bringing Cadence to this great cause!
Hey Goof, I know some of us on the Discord server may be Rooty For Spooty, but I'm always Rooty For Goofy. Good luck, have fun, and please touch Benchy for me! If not, at least pet the dog!
PET! THE! DOG!
Donating again during Cadence of Hyrule, a game that I've been running myself, but sadly lack the equipment to record. I actually managed to PB the 100% category a couple hours ago--1:16:00! Maybe one day... (Donation goes to Edobean's choice.)
Pet that dog
Come on chat, we're over halfway to the Animorphs run. Let's get a donation train going!
Super hype to see my dude LookinToad running Mega Man 4 at AGDQ 2020. Fight, LookinToad, for everlasting peace AND to defeat cancer!
pet that dog!!!
beep boop. Please pet the dog.
Had to donate during the Cadence run! I fell in love with Crypt of the Necrodancer after seeing Spooty's run last year, and I'm thrilled to see him back again running Cadence of Hyrule. Good luck on the run, and make sure to pet the dog!
PET. THAT. DOG.
Can we get a $5 train to pet that doggo?
PET THAT DOG, COWARD
Pj's powers brought me to his run of Lagoon and let me know of this amazing community. His powers have for years reached beyond time and space. Thank goodness he uses his powers for games and not reality. Please if you can find him(PJ) give this money to his choice, if not then to joke% for Super Hydlide.
PET THAT DOG!
Zelda and Mega Man are both favorite series of mine, and having both back-to-back feels like the perfect time to donate. Here's to all of the awesome runners, and crew behind the scenes. Pet the dog, and for good measure... POYO! #Poyo2020
PET THE DOG!
Gotta donate for that Animorphs run. I owned that game as a kid, it really is that bad, and I rally want to see Keizaron take another crack at it.Keep up the good work GDQ. It's been a lot of fun so far this week <3
PET THAT DOG
Donating yet again for one of the best charity events. Here is 25 dollars for Animorphs bonus game. And if this is during the Cadence of Hyrule race, pet the dog!
I heard there's a dog that needs petting? Here's $25 to pet that dog!
Gotta donate when Crypt of the Necrodancer or Cadence of Hyrule appears. Have played both those games too much. Also pet that dog.
Good luck on the race, Spooty. Let this donation to go to Spooty's choice.
We need to morph this HYPE with this Animorphs run! Also, PET THAT DOGGO.
Hey guy, this is Stephen Kiazyk (aka SMK, you just saw my handwriting on the 'tracker' during the interview). I was also one of the programmers on Cadence of Hyrule! and I'm sending this donation from the BYG office in Vancouver, Canada. Best of luck to Spooty and Goof, do us proud!
PET THE GOATPET THE EEVEEPET THE DOG
pet the dog, pet the dog, pet the dog, PET THE DOG!!!
It is VITALLY important that you pet the dog so we can extend our streak of petting dogs to 2 after the OoT FrankerZ ACE!
Pet *CLAP* The *CLAP* Dog *CLAP*
pet the dog like you should point and click your gun uwu doom<3
To my man Goof, and all the runners and teams... thanks so much! Give it your best and lets all help beat cancer.PET THAT DOG!!!
As an aspiring Cadence of Hyrule runner, I'm blown away and I think I've got a lot to learn... thanks Spooty and Goof for a JAMMING run!
I love the power glove. It's so bad.
The dog needs love! Pet the dog!
Is it too late to pet that pup?
All doggos are good and deserve to be petted. Please pet them for me! ❤
Had a closing shift tonight with an opening shift tomorrow. Can I get an F. At least I have awesome speedruns to make it a little easier to get through.
With all the negativity and bad news surrounding the Australian bushfires I must say it is nice to see so many people go together for a great cause playing some great games! Lets all donate for some horrid games too! Let's go Animorphs!
Me CRUMNGA! Me love speed runs! Me smash donation button!
Mixing two popular franchises with good music and a new cute character (Octavo)? No wonder why this game became so popular!And you know what else is popular? ANIMORPHS wait what
Spooty and Goof! I baaaasically just started watching you both stream, and I’m so hype to see you racing my new favorite Zelda game! That’s right, I said it. Good luck to you both, and thanks for being such consistent streamers so I can Cadence vicariously during my work days. Time to dance our way to a cancer-free future!
PET DOG. DOG LIKE PETS.
Cadence of Hyrule is my favorite game I never knew I would love. This speedrun is going to be fascinating.
Props to the sound crew for cranking these sick beats.
Pet that dog!
Please pet me!
Cadence of Hyrule is one of my favorite games, playing cooperatively with my Zelda is so special. Good luck with the runs, and thanks for showcasing this gem of a game. Keep the music volume up: These jams are The Slap!
this cadence race is SO GOOD!!!
PET THE DOGGO!
Aloha everyone. Awesome marathon so far. Keep up the amazing work. Putting the money towards Animorphs. With Keizaron talking it up so much it HAS to be an outstanding run, right?
Good luck Spoot and Goof! Donation to winner's choice :)
Go fast, and also donate for Animorphs
I gotta see this run! Keiz needs his redemption from the last run at GDQ! Let's g👌!
On new years eve I yelled at my friends for a solid 20 min about Animorphs, with a powerpoint presentation to go with it, and I did so loudly enough that I lost my voice the next day. Thus I am morally obligated to donate for Animorphs at AGDQ so here is one dollar for every core book in the series.
I had to donate during the run of one of my all time fsvorite games! This is insane to watch and I cant wait to see what happens!!!
Keep up the great runs for a great cause!
Thank you, as always, for the great runs and the great times.
Goof, that was extremely spicy.
Master, master,master! See you at the marketplace!
I always love watching the Megaman Races. Good Luck and lets get some Hype!
Awful block hype.
Amazing OoT run and Cadence of Hyrule! No time to bet those doggos though...
AGDQ is so awesome! I encounter so many people affected by cancer in my line of work, and have to find some way to give them comfort. So, knowing that something so important to me from my childhood like Mega Man being used to help prevent pain in the world brings me so much comfort. Good luck to the runners! Speed run! For Everlasting Peace!
Great to see Destiny 2 make it into GDQ, let's get that legit Riven incentive met!
What a great Cadence of Hyrule run! Had to donate, 3 time cancer survivor and always special watching every year. Thank you to everyone involved for this great event.
great cadence race :)
Had to donate for that Cadence of Hyrule race, think I might have to learn to run this game it looks so fun!
K8 song mostly skipped? Career suicide. Northernlion crew let's start a donation train for K8!
That Cadence race was amazing! But you know what could be more amazing? A $5 donation train to get animorphs added to Awful Block! You know there's got to be a goose in that game.Honk!
Loving this evening's slate of games and all of the amazing people who always come together to make these events happen. It's for a great cause, so here's to seeing a great Animorph's speedrun.
Let's tease keiz!Hate cancer but love agdq!
This event has totally destroyed my circadian rhythm, and I'm okay with that. Potting the money to Animorphs, because it's practically guaranteed to be hilarious.
The Cadence run was great, both runners are amazing at the game!
Awesome Cadence of Hyrule run! They finished the game before I could even update to the newest version!
Animorphs! Animorphs! Animorphs! Animorphs!25 more dollars if the crowd chants.
Had to donate during the Mega Man relay and show support for my good friend LookinToad! So proud to see you on stage at GDQ!!
Okay, FINE, I'll donate to the Animorphs incentive. But once this one is met everyone should donate to Fire Emblem: 3 Houses Black Eagles route, because EDELGARD DID NOTHING WRONG.
Kangaroo! No! What? Kangaroo!
Hmmmmmm GOOD
That Cadence of Hyrule run was amazing!! Also WE! NEED! ANIMORPHS!
Let's see that Animorphs run! Maybe Keiz can actually finish the run for once.
As a lover of the book series, I can't wait to see how terrible the Animorphs game is. HONK!
Let’s Animorph the time we have until Awful Games into a $5 Train Tour! I won’t be awake for it but I will watch it later when it gets posted. Make this night r0x0r!
Happy 10 I cant believe this has been still going on and it has been great watching all you speed run gamers to help in peoples need. thank you for everything and good luck on your run!
When can we see Animorphs on "The First Step"? Because J_Hobz needs to play it, and I'm not convinced Keizaron's ever finished it either.
the animorphs vitriol was so real I just HAD to donate to make sure we see the run happen
A N I M O R P H S
animore animorphs please
This run needs to happen
I was dying laughing during this interview segment - thank you for that :D
Ça va encore être dur de se lever pour bosser demain. Bon courage les gens et bourrez ! #MarioLight
My boyfriend wants to see Keizaron suffer.
Gotta donate to make Super Hydlide joke % happen.
The last attempt to run this game was as cursed as the middle pictures on animorphs covers. Let's hope this one's just as bad.
Mmmmmm.... Tea....
Give chat what it wants, Ani-honks
IT'S MORPHIN' TIME
Whattup homies.
Tea. Animorphs. Honks. Best stream!
Let's get this Animorphs incentive met so we can start Awful Block right.
Shout out to keiz always entertaining in what every he does.
Love to my MM4 boys but especially love to my brother lookin'toad. Let's go Toad Mode <3
pls we gotta see animorphs c'mon
Lovely interview, can we get an incentive to have someone eating tea on couch during animorphs?
Ever since I was a young boy, Megaman has been a big part of my life. Starting from the Battle Network series and going to the original series, the X series, and also the Zero series, it fills me with joy to see people experience the legacy of the blue bomber. May your future shine brightly, and never stop fighting for everlasting piece. YOU ROCK, MAN, AND SO DO ALL THE RUNNERS FOR THIS RELAY RACE!
I'm Mega, I'm Man. Good luck Runners! Let's get some Animorphs after!!
big shoutout to my boyfriend, who introduced me to gdq and who i'm watching it with right now! we're both super excited for the animorphs bonus game; keizaron has inspired us in all of the worst ways possible. we can't wait to find out what could possibly go wrong this time. HYPE!
My name is HONK! Let's go Animorphs!!
Thank you for that interview. I didn't know I needed Sent eating tea in my life, but now I do know.
SUPER FIGHTING ROBOT MEGAMAN
Prizes!
This goes towards the animorph run that I. NEED. TO. SEE!
Donating to both help a good cause and hopefully win the woodburned Zelda coaster set because it's absolutely beautiful!
Hey there, LFR again. This donation to launch a rename from our restream in the Pokémon Hawlucha's renaming bid war. Let's call it André in reference to the well reknowned french wrestler and actor in the 70's and 80's.Hope all is going smoothly and joyfully on your side. Keep up the good work, friends, we'll follow you !(If that's a possibility, we insist on the use of the accent when renaming, please. As in PokÉmon :p)
Gotta get 25 in for Megaman into Awful Block. Let's hope to crack a million before the block is up!
Please More Animorphs 2020
Thanks to all the runners for an awesome marathon so far. Hi Oscar, Varg, Stephen, and Matt watching with me.
Zelda beat me up at my piano recital! She's the REAL villain!
Why am I still awake at 7 am and why is AGDQ so good?! Looking forward to Animorphs.
I didn't used to like strategy games, but Fire Emblem: Three Houses changed all that. I picked it up at the constant nagging of my friends, and I haven't been able to put it down since. Putting this donation towards choosing the Golden Deer house because it's the only house I've played thus far and it'll let me avoid spoilers, yay!
Lost my grandfather 4 years ago to esophageal cancer. I hope we can stop the scourge. Put this to the Animorphs run!
Keep Smiling moon2S
ANIMORPH GAMES DONE QUICK
I need to see Keizaron run this legendary third Animorphs game
That amazingly hilarious trainwreck of an interview convinced me - we need at least some portion of an Animorphs run from Keizaron!
Honk.
My husband and I watch GDQ every time its on and look forward to it! Hi Matt! Love you lots! $25 to the Animorphs bonus game!
That was a great Cadence of Hyrule run and I heard keys were important, so how about that keys-goron Animorphs run?
Animorphs!
Hey Stephen, I donated for the blanket!
Yasssss! A Mega Man relay with the best announcer ever: Edobean!!!!!!!
You guys are great!
This is for my roommate who probably fell asleep in the other room, WAKE UP the relay race is about to begin!
Hello! I've been watching GDQ with my sister since this past summer, and this is my first time donating. Thank you to all the staff and runners for making all of this possible for such a wonderful cause, and for giving me something to binge over college break. I'll donate an extra $25 if the host will admit that Perrserker is the superior evolution of Meowth! Love you all, and, of course, Honk!!
Did someone say Animorphs? Let's do this people, let Keizaron play! Down with the yeerks!
Please give me dat blanket.
I want to watch Hobbs suffer
Let's get a $5 going for Animorphs!
Please put this toward the Animorphs incentive. Love you all at GDQ
The Princess demands Animorphs! Lion needs his redemption arc! Give more trash Keizaron!
I enjoy watching train wrecks so I figured I would donate for animorphs, as that's what it sounds like.
1 Dollar for every year of GDQ!
Zelda prizes are too hype. Stoked for the Megaman race and Kei's better Pokemon run!
After watching that interview, I had to donate for an Animorphs redemption arc!
WE WANT ANIMORPHS! WE WANNA KICK CANCER'S *HONK*Let's go everyone and support cancer research woo!!Thanks to all of the runners, volunteers, and staff for making all of this happen!
Animorphs. What can I say? I'm curious!Also loving the dancing crew in the audience. Keep on keeping on.
$5 train to fight the terrible blight that is cancer with the terrible game that is Animorphs. Fire with fire friends.
First time donating to such a great cause. Put this donation towards the Animorphs incentive. #Keizamorphs
After losing 2 relatives to cancer already, I have to donate for this great cause, so that less people will have to endure this experience. Thank you for all the great work.
My cat also enjoys speed running in the middle of the night, let’s see some more animals! Donating for Animorphs
That Keizaron interview was hilarious. Let's get this Animorphs run met!
Long live the honk!
Good Morning from Germany! Can't wait for the Animorphs Run, the Awful Game Block is always a Highlight!
Don't care what you say. I want to see Keis play Animorphs. Yes I'm a masochist, why do you ask?
I love Keizaron's nail polish color! Donating to contribute to the inevitable chaos that will be his Animorphs run.
Can't wait to see my favorite game of all time, Animorphs, be played live at GDQ!
I'm just gonna assume that korok on the mug is officially part of the new Breath of the Wild 101% run, I want to be the first to submit my time
Hey lookintoad, do your best and stay “Quikz” man!
I want to see how bad Animorphs truly is...
Here is some money I was going to use to buy tea but Animorphs needs it more
Hey guys, we're only 2/3rds of the way there to Animorphs! I promise it'll be better than watching Cats.
Let's make this Animorphs run happen!
Come on, I have to donate to get Animorphs in! Good luck to the runners, and thank everyone for the amazing week of entertainment.
Gotta see that Animorphs run!
Come on, chat! $5 train to unlock Animorphs and start out Awful Block the right way! Here's 5 of them!
Such amazing. Such good. Keep it going all night long.
Let's start the Awful block off where it can only get better.
Animorphs...
Seems fitting to follow up Cadence of Hyrule with a game full of Rock & Roll. Super hype to see Mega Man get crushed! Much love from the front row.
We've been watching the good, we're about to start the bad, now we need the Keizaron to play animorphs
Donating to see a video game animorph into a trainwreck live on the main stage
I'm unsure if I should root for the completion of Animorphs or the removal of Keiz during Animorphs, but either way here's some money for it.
Donating to cheer on one of my best friends of over 20 years, notriley4. This is his first GDQ run and I know he's going to rock it. Also heck cancer. I've had family fight it and want people to help this amazing cause to fight it .
We have got to get Animorphs on this stage! Let's get a $5 honk train going. HONK! <3
Honkimorphs? Anihonks? I need to see this run and watch Keiz descend into madness along with the rest of us!
ANIMORPHS!
It's Anamorphin time!
Cadence Rules, sad I missed it. Good job to both runners.
My wife and I love watching and support Games Done Quick, but this time it is especially important to us as she has battled cancer since early 2019. Thanks to every one participating, whether it's running, organizing or donating! Let's see that animorphs run!
One one hand we can see more games, on the other the animorphs game might ruin my childhood. Oh well...
Nothing sells me more on donating to Animorphs than the runner's hatred towards the game. Here is $25 enjoy the game
This cursed donation goes out to all the things I've never seen at a GDQ before! Come to think of it, I don't remember ever hearing the audience boo anything at GDQ. There's another 10 dollars in it if the audience can change that for me and boo me right out of the donation box.
Thank you... also Honk!
A cool fiver for the Figment dancer!
Make my eyes bleed you cowards. More animorphs.
Big props to the camera-person during that interview capturing all of the forlorn stares into the camera. That's surely worth some cancer crushing cash
Stay DETERMINED to erase cancer, friends.
Animorphs, lol... I need to see that!
Animorphs!! Keizaron!! HONK!!
As promised! This run will certainly finish. Probably.
Go animorphs!
Two Honk-dred dollars for Untitled Pokemon Game with Goose-aron
Woo Animorphs.
I shouldn't be up this late but I want to try for awful block and patty. Have to donate now to make sure this animorphs run makes it through.
I won't be able to see the Animorphs run until tomorrow, but I want to be able to see the Animorphs run at some point, so it has to happen in order for me to do that. Here's more towards getting it to happen!
Let's get that Animorphs incentive! Good luck Keizaron!
3 Dollars for every year of GDQ! Also, ANIMORPHS! ANIMORPHS! ANIMORPHS!
What better time to donate than when it can help destroy both cancer and Kiezeron's sanity
Animorphs animorphs animorphs!
My fiance also wants to see Keizaron suffer.
Hey AGDQ. Thanks for all you do, and bring on the Mega Man relay!
Link was an Animorph
My father was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer this year. His prognosis isn’t great, but just like Mega Man fights for everlasting peace, my dad won’t give up. Please donate, it might not help my dad, but it could help someone you know and love.Can I get a MEGA MAN HYPE for my dad?
Please Animorphs please
Donating for Animorphs: moar awful games pleeez
Animorphs!
For once I can actually watch the Mega man classic block. Let's get a donation war starting. Mega man 4 is best classic Mega man!
Just woke up. First thing of cause is firering up GDQ. Honk Honk from Germany!
Keizaron is one of my favorite runners. So of course I want to inflict the pain of Animorphs upon him!
The animorphs run from a few years ago remains one of my favorite memories of GDQ. Gotta donate to ensure more people are made to suffer through it. :)
Mega Man love it, long time viewer 3 rd time donteing. Greetings from Germany. Mega Man HYYYYYYYYPEEE!
This is probably my favorite GDQ so far! Hype it up for the cause!
25$ because why not and because i can. can't wait for the awful block.
If the Pharaohs looking up at the Stars had caught Wind of this relay, they would say it was a Bright idea. The Gravity of this statement should light a Flame under us all. So Ring in the new year with your Gyros to navigate the Blizzard of Dusty Crystals gathered on Plants. Get your Skull Barriers, Napalm Bombs, and Silver Tomahawks ready, and Dive into HappyStone cold speedruns with the Yamato guarantee. Make sure those Drills are Charged over Knight, and help LookinToad make Waves singing the Centaur Man Song for Everlasting Peace.
Donating for my friend Stephen who lost his mom to cancer. Let's put cancer down from the count and have Keizaron forcibly removed from GDQ #KeizaMood
ANIMOPRHS!
Thanks to everyone involved for another wonderful week of Speedruns. My Grandfather died from Cancer 3 weeks before I was born and so I never got to meet him, so I hope the money we raise will make a difference so that no one else misses out on experiences with those they love. This donation goes towards kicking off the Awful games done quick with a "wonderful" run of Animorphs
An animorphs run sounds downright terrible. Let's see it!
From one survivor to another, I have to see Keizaron attempt Animorphs. Been watching since 2013; thanks to the runners and staff for always putting on a great show.
Good luck to Terrex on my favorite classic mega man game! Go team Mr. X! Putting this towards getting keiz to play a bad game after watching these good games
Thank you to all the runners and organizers behind this fantastic event. You entertain and inspire, and remind us that we're at our best coming together to help others.
Déjà le milieu de la semaine... ou "seulement' ? Selon le niveau de fatigue. #DarkMage
Let's go Mega Man! Fight on for Everlasting Speed! This donation is going towards the Animorphs bonus run not just because it's Animorphs, but because it's KEIZARON running Animorphs; that's one easy way to take a run from Great to Godlike.
Sup GDQ, how HYPE are you all for this race? Shoutout to LookinToad. Congrats on your GDQ debut. Thanks for being a great friend and for your PhilosophoToad streams. Super proud of you, my guy. Good luck to everyone on the race.
God help me, this is for Animorphs. I will donate another $500 if the audience morphs into actual animals right now.
♥️
Some of us are watching from home, and some of us are in the audience tonight, but everyone from The Pond is here and cheering you on! We are so proud that you've made it to the Big Stage! We all want to say how grateful we are to be part of the amazing community that you have brought together, whether it is through love of speedgaming, or your legendary Toad Talks, we're all here for the good vibes :slight_smile: Good luck to all of the runners, and in the immortal words of Lookintoad himself, 'shut up and love yourself!
Lost some wonderful people to cancer so i'm honor to support the amazing work you are all doing. Put this towards the Animorphs incentive, your outstanding professionalism during the interview has inspired me. Party On
Always love that time of year when GDQ is on. Makes the cold and dark winters of New England a lot more enjoyable.
Can't wait to watch this Mega Man race and laugh heartily at Keizaron having to deal with those ridiculous shape-shifters. Here's 25 bucks to making the latter a painful reality.
Long time watcher, first time donor. I love these events because video games represent such positive memories, hope, and shared experiences in a dark world. Awful block is my favorite block, so much so that I took a day off work just to stay up and watch it. You best believe I'm donating to extend it.
Rocket-punch Cancer in the face
Mega Man's my favorite series, and I always look forward to seeing it at GDQ. Here's hoping that Mega Man never gives up, and may all the runners teach Wily a lesson in record speed!
Super-fighting robot...MEGA MAN! I adore these games, and seeing them rocked more skilfully than I could ever hope to is exciting, inspiring, and the best way to spend a weeknight. Best luck to the runners; let's raise money to kick cancer's butt like Mega Man repeatedly does to Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters!
Fast the run do!
Had to donate during the Mega Man block again. My dad was recently diagnosed with cancer, and we've been dealing with the treatments for the past couple of months. I never appreciated how disruptive and terrible cancer was until a family member experienced it firsthand. Here's to hoping for a cancer-free future.
Donating in honor of my mom. Her cancer was caught late, when it was almost stage four, and she lost her fight. But hopefully, with the help of the Prevent Cancer Foundation, many more people will catch theirs early - or better yet, never get it at all.
Gotta rep ma boi Megaman, lost my Uncle to Cancer so hopefully my donation will help Megaman get equipped with the right weapon to take out Cancer man!
hey agdq! been watching twice a year since 2013! megaman has always been a staple for this event and i’m always hyped to see it! had to donate for that good old animorphs run and to get in for the dino crisis banner. good luck and lets prevent some cancer!
Thanks for teaching me how to beat Airman
Why bother getting robot master weapons when you can just use PJ against Wily?
Awful games block warms my heart year after year. Thank you for everything you all do! Let’s all bask in Animorphs’ awful-ness!
So proud of you Alexy and your squad! Be sure to take some Riven pics first before you beat her!
Gotta see that Animorphs run!! Great luck to Keiz and to the rest of the runners for the 'Awful' block!
Animorphs, animorphs, animorphs
I was SUPER into Animorphs growing up and I will never forget what a disappointing atrocity this game is. If I made a list of things that suck, cancer would probably be number one... but this game would make the top five.
Animorphs! Animorphs! Animorphs!
Alright, Mega Man relay!! Good luck to everyone, and
honk.
Hey AGDQ 2020! Finally making my first donation to an awesome cause and am sending much love to all the runners but especially to my boy, Toad! Hanging out and watching him run Mega Man 4 again and again has always been a blast, and he's an absolute inspiration to me. I'm super proud to be your friend and am psyched to be able to watch this right now. Good luck to all three teams! Let's bust right on through cancer and jump and shoot to victory!
Toad you can do it! The lethargic crew is behind you!
I can't believe Mega Man 4 came out 26 years 11 months and 19 days ago (in Europe) (I checked)! We played Mario and Mega Man on my friends NES every summer as a kid and it was the best! But then, I lost my dad to cancer when I was 10 years old and everything changed. Cancer is a horrible disease and we must continue working until it is defeated! I dragged myself out of the bead early today just to catch this relay race and see one of my favorite childhood games getting destroyed! PS. What did the guard of the robot museum say to the other guard when Dr. Wily attacked? "We have to evacuate, man. This is not a *drill, man*" Good luck to all runners!
I lost both my grandmother and my aunt to cancer in the last two years, and it was heartbreaking for my family. I hope the money we raise this event will prevent that hurt in future. Love the cause, and love the event. <3
First Donation of AGDQ 2020!
Just wanted to donate during my favorite game series. Keep Rocking that MegaMan!
Had to donate towards Keizaron's Animorphs run after that truly incredible interview. You could just feel the passion and excitement for the game bursting through the screen. Best of luck, Keiz! If this game is even half as entertaining as your Pokemon Crystal run from last GDQ, it's sure to be a highlight of the night!
Let's make thay animorph run/debacle happen!
Greetings from Texas! Let's get TransMORPHED and raise money for a great cause!
gotta do my part to make keizaron give animorphs the swan song it deserves. Or maybe Goose song might be more fitting?
Here's my share towards the Animorphs bonus run! I won't be awake to watch it, but it's one of my brother Charlie and I's favorite runs! He introduced speedrunning to me years ago and just learned my first (Goose) game last year! Let's do this! HONK!
How could I not donate during a Mega Man relay? Maybe if I don't make a stupid joke, I get my donation read for once. Good luck to all the runners!
First time catching GDQ live! Fortunately managed to find a cafe with wifi, because I didn't want to miss seeing these amazing Mega Man runs. (How do people come up with these messages - I'm too distracted by watching!)
Hot Take: Final Fantasy 13 is not only not bad, it's actually good!
Joining the $5 train to afflict Animorphs upon Keizaron. Less than $10k to go!!
I always donate during Mega Man. Great race so far!
Let's get that Animorphs GBC run!
Khanster here I wish I could be there with all of you guys this year best of luck to the classic mega man crew. Obviously mega man 6 is the best one. Commentators can decide where this goes
Let's get this $5 donation train for Animorphs rolling! Honk... I mean choo choo!
Go daddy!
Keep running, Mega Man! You've fought against countless robot masters, but I know against cancer you can NOT fail..d! DO THE BUSINESS!!
Are we playing Which Mega Man Is Best? Can I cast my vote for Mega Man 2?
Obviously the best classic Mega Man is Animorphs for the Gameboy Color. Donate!
Can't wait for Awful Block this year, starting with Mega Man 6, which better be followed by Animorphs!!!
Someone at work told me her husband was running Megaman 5 in the race tonight, but I forgot to ask her what his Twitch handle is! So shoutouts to Mary, this donation is dedicated to the two of you! Good luck to everyone in the race!!!
Best MegaMan game? There's only one real option here. Shoutouts to the MM2 Rando and all the other MegaMan speedrunning communities. Much love!
5x $5 train!
Donation train! Choo Choo! Lets get that animorphs!
Always love me some Megaman! Good luck to all the runners, and remember; Wily always wins! (any defeats on stream don't count)

FOR ANIMORPHS
Animorphs hype!
I had to donate during one of my favorite game series ever - here's $1 for every day I've been cancer free. This event is so inspiring, it's amazing seeing so many coming together for such a great cause. Thanks so much to you all and keep it going - you all are awesome.
Making Keizamorph happen!!
I don't wanna be a Yeerk' but I need to see Keiz play Animorphs. Get to donating cuties.
Fight Mega Man! For everlasting peace!
had to donate during mega man 5, which is easily the best mega man. will donate another $50 if I can get the crowd to cheer in agreement!
So hyped and proud to see my boy ResistingFrame running MM6 on stage at GDQ in a little bit! MM6 is my favorite in the classic series, and I'm so glad to see one of my favorite runners repping it! I'll donate an additional $25 for each MM6 runner who gets Butter, and $50 if anyone gets Bomb Skip. Good luck to all the runners!
I’ve been watch GDQ grow for quite some time, now. The scale of it all. All of these people from different walks coming together due to many commonalities to do a whole lot of good. I absolutely love it. Shoutout to Keizaron, Jhobz, Edobean, and Mike Uyama. It was a pleasure meeting you all during TwitchCon. Maybe see you again this year during Keiz’s “birthday!” ;)ANIMORPHS HOOONNNK!!!
Making this donation to help delete cancer like MegaMan deletes viruses! Good luck to all the runners in the Mega Man relay race, Battle Routine, Set! Execute!!Putting this towards the Animorphs run, because who doesn't like bad games?
$5 donation train for Animorphs with everyone commenting what they’d morph into? I’d be a possum because I also want to be asleep right now.

Another $5 train for Animorphs!!
Wily! My fellow doctor! I'm sorry you couldn't join me at AGDQ this year, but I'm rooting for you to overcome your blue enemy. I know how difficult those blue heroes can be... Trust me... Perhaps you can join me on the couch next year and we can root against them together!
Animorphs donation train! Woot Woot!
Super Fighting robots unite!
Whether you rate 4-6 high or low, the Mega Man games are just so good that they're amazingly fun even when you're playing the "worst" ones. I still marathon the NES games once every couple of years just because nothing else scratches the itch.
Keep the donation train going! CHOO CHOO!

Greetings from the second couch area. Both of my parents were diagnosed with cancer in 2019 and both are survivors!!! I’m very very thankful for organizations such as PCF for early detection. I love my folks so much and I’m so glad to have them around. Let’s gooooo Team Mr X. Much love to all of the mega man community for all of their support as a newer speedrunner. Let’s get some mega HYPE in the room for all of these runners!!
amimornfs,
Stop the yeerks!
mighty animorphing keizaron-ers
I just found out my mom has cancer on Monday night. I wish I could donate more, but it's all I can afford at the moment. Thank you for doing these events every year.
another 50, as promised! I heard a few boos in the crowd, which I’ll assume were directed at cancer… great event, great cause, thank y’all for your hard work putting these events together!
Animorphs
CHOO CHOO
It's time to tease Keiz.
AGDQ is always a great event. Good luck to all the runners!

Staying up late for Keizaron's Animorphs run! its such a hot mess of a game, that you have to see it to believe it!

if megaman were an animorph would he turn into rush? really makes you :think:
For Animorphs!
Go Animorphs!
Amimorph
This Animorphs run will change your life. Let's make it happen people.
let's go keiz
Animorphs
Lets get that Animorphs incentive
Mega Man and incentive donation for Animorphs! Let's see the Keizaron suffer for our amusement! Or give him a chance at redemption. Whatever gets you to donate!
Animorphs / Megaman crossover when?
I'm a simple man, I see trash games on the roster, I donate.
Edobean my favorite host, and animorphs?! Best day ever. Donation goes to Edo's choice as long as two conditions are filled. 1. It goes towards animoprhs and 2. She gives us her famous well known extra wonderful impersonation of.... waluigi. Waah!
YOU THOUGHT THIS WAS PROTOMAN. BUT IT WAS ME!! DARKMAN!!!
animorphs.
Twitch chat got me to donate, don’t give up!,
Trash Please.
From someone whose first Megaman game was Megaman Soccer, what is Megaman 6? Is it canon?
I already donated toward it earlier this evening but I just have to throw more money toward making Animorphs happen. Who knows, maybe the RNG will cooperate for long enough to make the run winnable this time!
FOR ANIMORPHS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Animorphs is bea
Oh wow, I did not know that Animorphs was an incentive. How could I not donate for a run of this game by Keizaron?
Let's get a train going, we need to see animorphs!
I got a fever and the only prescription is more Animorphs!
More games is more good, lets get that animorphs run
Everyone loves watching bad games. Lets suffer together through this experience. Go Animorphs!
ANIMORPH! ANIMORPH! ANIMORPH!
Mega Man 5 and 6 are criminally underrated games that deserve a better reputation than they get. 4 is... well it's 4. In any case I'm always happy to see the latter NES Mega Man games get some time in the spotlight, especially when followed up by Animorphs on GBC, which is where this donation is going.
ANIMORPHS
We're so close to Animorphs and Hobbs slamming that power button at estimate! There's nothing better to donate towards, other than stopping cancer of course. We can do this!
Yo, Kevin here from Power Up Audio. This race is hype as heck, and commentary is on POINT. Keep it up gents!... Had to donate because...against my better judgement, I want to see Animorphs.(Also no need to read, but Edo ur the best)
This is the home stench! Sorry, I mean home stretch!
We all know what this is for. It's for Animorphs.
Jade, keep tearing up those magazines and hello to everyone at GDQ from Japan!
The Animorphs books were a big part of my childhood, but I didn't know there was a video game. We have to get that incentive met so I can see what is no doubt a faithful and well-made adaptation!
FOR ANIMORPHS AGAIN!
choo choo
I've watched all GDQ runs. (yes that's a lot of time). And am happy to say that from this AGDQ and on I will be donating as much as I can for all the amazing runs and prizes. Keep up the awesome work. HYPE
Long time watcher, long time donator! Greetings from Canada! Other GDQ Donation-isms!
Animorphs is going to be horrible we definitely need to see it
Loving this classic Megaman race to death. Go all teams! Donation to Animorphs because more AGDQ equals better world.
If a animorph can turn into any type of animal, how come they don't turn into a trex when fighting bad guys?
Gotta see Animorphs!
Flood start at home but thanks to AGDQ and FrenchRestream I stay cool. Congratulations on all your work #Dvvol2
Gimme that Animorphs badness
Salut les loulous,Je tiens juste à signaler que les Toronto Raptors sont les champions NBA en titre.Sinon merci le staff, les ambianceurs et la superbe modération comme d'habitude.#Goupix
$10 for animorphs!!
For animorphs!!!
Donation train for that Animorphs bonus!!! I can barely contain the HONKS!!
60 for MEGA MAN 6 and ANIMORPHS!!! ANIMORPHS HYPEEE
long time watcher, first time donating, do we have any animorphers in the chat?
Animorphs? Keizaron? I don't know whether to laugh or scream.
$5 train for Animorphs! and everyone get hype for Dos Animorphs next year
As instructed, I contribute to bringing animorphs to fruition.
animorphs let’s GOOOOOO
Unfortuantely, I found out today that my grandmother has a cancerous brain tumor, and despite money being tight, I wanted to donate a little bit to try and help prevent other people from having to go through the same thing with their loved ones. Here's to cancer research and early screenings, and hopefully we can help save some lives in the future. Love GDQ and the Mega Man Block, and best of luck to all the runners!
\ keizaNeat / MAKE KEIZ SUFFER \ keizaNeat /
If a community of furries didn't donate to fund the animorphs run, we'd be committing criminal crimes from the federal law. Here's our third community donation!
Free Keizaron!
Can't believe how close this Megaman relay is! Great job by all runners.We just have to see this Animorphs run! Honk!
\ keizaNeat / MAKE KEIZ SUFFER \ keizaNeat /

MAKE KEIZ SUFFER
ANIMORPHS!
[EN] Good luck for the end of the event. Kiss[FR] Bourrez les dons sur André! Bises à tous!#GDQup
Is it weird that I want to root for Keiz, but also want to see him suffer with Animorphs? Some answers we may never know.
Staying up late for this, better make Keiz suffer
Animorphs dono train has no brakes!!!
Animorphs! Animorphs! ANIMORPHS!!! ANIMORPHS!!! COME ON, PEOPLE, CHEER WITH ME!!!!!

Okay, let's get the train going for Animorphs. Come on folks!
For everlasting peace.
Final Push for Keizaron: T H E S U F F E R I N GLet's go!
Remember! The more you donate towards Animorphs, the more you donate against cancer! Fight Cancer! Fight for Animorphs! Save Lives! Make Keiz Suffer!
:)
Awesome mega man gaming guys! Had to donate towards Animorphs.
This Mega Man race has been so close the whole time, I can't wait to see how it ends! Also, let's make Animorphs happen!
Had to wait for the mm6 portion of the relay. As I started to learn this game through the POW suit. Hope to race in the future.
So close, lets make animorphs happen
Let's blast cancer! Good luck to all runners!
I loved watching the mega man cartoon growing up. And I love that you guys are going a live stream of the game! Keep it up I love what you guys do!
♥️
After four years to lick his wounds, it's time for Keizaron to finish Pokemon: Animorphs edition.
Always love this time of year. Thanks to everyone that makes this event come together.
Animorphs was my favorite book as a kid... the characters went through a surprising amount of torture for a children's book series and now we should pass that on... to Keizaron!!! :D
For extra Awfulness.
Tanks to all of AGDQ, Always enjoy to be beaten for a good cause.
Here's a question- could Megaman defeat an awful Goose? Asking for a friend....
Won't be able to watch it live, but the Joke% of Super Hydlide sounds awesome!
Hey There Greetings from Germany,Im a long time watcher and donator, and I m very happy having the opportunity to donate during the Mega Man race.Mega Man two was the first game I ve ever played and since then I m in love with the Blue Bomber.Keep up the great Work for a good cause.All the Best!
This one goes out for both Animorphs and BEST BOI DIMITRI in Three Houses! Go quick everyone!
Gotta get one more in for Mega Man!
It's Morphin' Time!Oh, wait...Either way, I want to shout out the '90s for teaching teenagers that anyone could have super powers, as long as that power was not being yourself.
Awful Block Hype!!!

feenHonk
They know why the doggo needs to be named Jeannette. Muahahahaha.
Donating in honor of my partner's amazing uncle who passed just about a year ago from cancer. Big love to everyone making this event happen, from the a/v crew, to the announcers, the runners, the backend folks who nobody else besides y'all know, just everyone out there making this happen. Kick cancers ass! Animoprh time!!!
Thanks to the front row dancers for the entertainment during the intermissions!
But Edo, what do *you* think is the best Mega Man?
Joke% for Super Hydlide? Take my money!
gdqPride
I should be in bed but couldn't miss this animorphs run.
I am so happy to see Animorphs getting some love! I used to read Animorphs books so much that I had dreams my friend Fentry was transforming into a heckin doggo. Keep up the good work everyone putting on this incredible event.
So I heard that Keizaron is doing a run. After that last Pokemon run, I can only hope this is just as fun. Good luck and hello Edobean. You are my favorite!
Je suis un grand fan de catch depuis plus de 15 ans, je me sens obligé de donner pour cette légende qu'est André le géant. Allez on bourre les dons les amis !
Keizaron vs Animorphs is the ultimate redemption arc, prove me wrong. Can't wait to witness this glorious mess of a game again! Also, obligatory Poyo!
Awful block is best block.
Keiz I'm ready to stare into the abyss that is Know the Secret to complete the Animorphs game trilogy for you. Animorphs is Animorphing me.
Hi from The students of Garnvinde Elementary School in Sweden. We wish good luck to all the runners and thanks to GDQ for this event and the good cause.
Animorphs AND Edobean? This is the best run ever! Did you know the snake has the fastest movement? Hope you can make it to the end of the game this run!
Cant wait for the Destiny run later, and watching the Terreria run I missed earlier, keep up the great run!
so glad the animorph's goal was met! had to send in another donation, one dedicated specifically to a very great friend who has been fighting leukemia since her first diagnosis almost ten years ago while we were in high school. cancer took so much out of her, but she still refuses to let it take her future. here's to amy, her bravery, the bravery of every survivor out there and the bravery of all who lost the battle. let's make it so no one has to fight that battle again.
Donating in loving memory of my dear friend Johannes who recently passed away. AGDQ was his favorite event of the year and we've been watching it for years now. Thank you to all the runners and staff for this amazing start to the year
So nice to see one of my favorite memers Keiz getting another shot at this cursed run. And even better, he forced his couch to play Animorphs as well in preparation.With this event, you are a inspiration to a lot of people. Keep on keeping on
Love the awful block, so obviously have to donate here.
Ground force one commander has arrived! Keizaron know what to say. Bridget your grounded!
never been able to donate until this year so here we go! Awful Block is my absolute favorite, AND followed by horror block? poggers!
Hang in there Edo, it'll be over soon.
Awful Animorphs HYYYYYYYYYYYPE
So wait.. Your telling me I get to watch Cancer go Down ALONG with Keizerons Sanity? BEFORE I GO TO WORK?! SIGN ME UP! Donation goes to EDOBEEEEEEEEEAN Choice!
Awful time hype!
It's my birthday and what better way to celebrate than by donating for a bunch of awful Games Done (Awfully) Quick? I won't be able to watch as I'll be going to bed soon — best of luck to the Awful block runners!
First time donating to GDQ. I lost my mother to cancer over a decade ago, so PCF's mission means a lot. That's depressing though, so I'm donating for joke% to lift the mood.
Finally, the best Pokemon Game is being played at GDQ again.With the best Pokemon: 'Dog'
I expected more of you keiz...
here's to my boys in the crowd, you nerds better be having fun
Keizaron, I found you first via that GORGEOUS hot mess of a Crystal run last SGDQ, which got me hooked on watching speedrun races and bingos. I'm glad to be able to donate while you're actually out there suffering for our pleasure. Twenty five bucks is the minimum donation for your infamous Jynx cry, right?Donation goes to the glorious Keizameme's choice.
Boy do I love Pokemon! Go Keiz, catch those 'mon!
Thank you to my boyfriend Anthony, he really transformed my life.
I hope this run is a terrible as i expect. If Keiz FINISHES under estimate I'll donate another $25
IT'S A JOKE!!!!!
Can we donate to timeout Keiz?
Runner a little confused, but we enjoy the game! And of course support the good cause. HONK!
Shoutout to Seckswrecks, sorry I couldn't be there to grind my Pringles time down to sub-3, maybe next time! Also, Awful Block is Best Block
For Keizaron. Does it get any better than this?
animorphs lore here! hork-bajir are pacifist aliens that are under control by parasitic alien invaders known as yeerks, the main bad guys of the series! they have blades all over them to strip bark off trees!
First Time Donating.Let's Go Keizaron
Captured by Honk-Bajir
of course, what do i come home to after a night of bar trivia but Keizaron running animorphs. I hope Marphoria is currently in the audience. donation to runner's choice. happy 29th birthday to me.good luck on the run Keiz, love what y'all do, hope to be there for SQDQ 2020 :D
This is super fun, hang in there Keizaron!Please put this toward Keizaron playing Animorphs PC at a future GDQ. ;)
My favorite animal goes HONK!!
Can't miss a Keisaron run! Despite the covers, Animorphs is actually one of the best YA series ever written and I highly recommend it to everyone. The PDFs are online WITH THE AUTHORS BLESSING. I'll donate another $5 if this is read out loud to spread the good word of Animorphs! Let's do it!
It's a joke! *waves hands*
"Monkey is basically dog" and they say you don't learn anything during Awful Block!
AWFUL BLOCK! AWFUL BLOCK!
No ban please. I live for these awful games.
Awful block is best block. Let’s get that joke% incentive so we can hear Mike Uyama telling us when “it’s a joke!” a bunch of times.
Hey Keiz, we all know you're famous for your Pokemon cries. But can you do any Animorphs cries? I'll donate another $10 for your best shot. Runner's choice for both.
Humans are a blight. HONK!
Just wanted to give a big thank you to everyone: the runners, the staff, the audience, the animals harmed during the animorphs run, everyone. You all make this event something I look forward to time and time again.Awful block hype!
 (Comment rejected)
Keiz, stop messing around, "Bonus Game 3" is about to start.
I'm so glad you guys are going to play Hoshi wo Miru Hito, a game so bad it's known in Japan as the "Legendary... uh, Poopy Game". Anyway, hello CJ, are you watching the vods?
I can't believe I'm up at 3am watching Keizaron play Animorphs... again. Honestly, the previous run is one of my all time favorites. Good luck Keiz!
Can we hear your Kricketune impression Keiz? How about the Jynx?
Brossentia here! Husband broke his hip, so I couldn't come this year. To be fair, the Super Hydlide runner hasn't even gotten a sub-35, so whatevs!Thank you for all your donations, viewers. With every bad game on GDQ, an angel grows its wings. Not a particularly attractive angel. The Steve Buscemi of angels.
(Endo please read Immediately) Ground Force One Commander has Arrived! Bridget your grounded from GDQ!
We haven’t gotten introduced to those on the couch or bed Kupo!
Question for anyone who ISN'T Keizaron- How much is the incentive gonna be to make Keiz run that third Animorphs game next AGDQ? We gotta know so we can start saving up!Donation to Keiz's choice for being a good sport.
Keizaron finishing under estimate? That doesn't sound the GDQ way. I'll donate 50 more if he finishes OVER estimate.
Honestly, I think Keizaron grabbed a Goat because he's the the actual G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time)
Thank you, awful block, for bringing the Jabberwo..HORK BAJIR and Animorphs back out of my childhood subconscious. I hate you.Just eat my money and kill it off!
Woke up early to catch my favorite AGDQ host. It’s not a GDQ without Edobean!
"Save" those animals, Keiz! Also, is it too early to donate toward having Animorphs at SGDQ? If so, please put this toward Joke% for Super Hydlide.
Great to see Keiz and Animorphs ruining each others sanity to end the evil run of Cancer and the Yeerks. Donate to runners choice.
Always missed a love event so I just watched YouTube clips. Love what all you guys do. Keep it up.
For a game about saving animals, that's a LOT of fighting animals :p. Good luck for the run !
Keizaron, it's nice to see you at AGDQ! I don't know anything about Animorphs but let the frustration consume you! If I know anything about gaming... don't save the Animals!
Superbe journée en perspective. Merci la grève qui me permet de suivre les Awful avec le magnifique Kanon ( vive le catch ) #CoeurBleu
One dollar for each percent of this beautiful category. You're a legend, Keiz!
A cat is not a dog
The Hork-Bajir was the aliens the whole time
So this is a pokemon game, right? Pokemon ID donations? Yes? Well then, $7.57 for one of my fav pokemon Salandit! Donation to keizs choice.
Sleep deprived Awful Block is the best Awful Block. Shoutouts to the 3 AM Boys!
animorphs lore again! ax, or aximili-esgarrouth-isthill, is a young alien known as an andalite, a mouthless centaur like alien with four eyes. his brother gave the animorphs their morphing powers, and he can morph as well! he's obsessed with cinnamon buns as well!
All those animal noises, and nobody in the crowd thought to HONK?HONK BAJIR DONATION TRAIN FOR JOKE% SUPER HYDLIDE
Hi, AGDQ! 5th year watching, and before 7 months ago, I had no dealings with cancer. Today, I've lost 2 family members to brain and lung cancer, have 2 family members with prostate and lung cancer, and learned that both sides of my family have extensive histories of cancer. Did I mention I learned this at 30?While my own survival isn't my reason for donating, I've always loved what GDQ does for the good of everyone, not just gamers, and recently, it's become a lot more personal.Put this toward the Golden Deer in Fire Emblem 3 Houses. FEER THE DEER!... and Punch all the HONK-Bajir!
Why is this happening? Why would you inflict this game upon us?...He said as donating to the Super Hylide Joke thing. Sometimes this whole week feels like a troll.
This game is actually terrifying.
We should try to trick cancer into playing Animorphs. It's enough to kill... Most things.
Can we set up a donation incentive to make Keiz read the books so he knows who Ax is? Although, I grew up with Animorphs, so I might be Tobias'd...
Keizaron's runs have helped me through some of the worst days of my chronic illnesses. I just have to show my appreciation for him subjecting himself to this hideous game. Bless you, Keiz.
Animorphs with keys was amazing last time and I'm stoked it's starting the awful block its near 4am in toronto but I took the day off work tomorrow just to stay tuned all night. I can't ever donate much but it's for a good cause and I couldnt be happier to do it. I'll donate another 10 if this gets read live!!good luck everybody
Keiz, if you get food from beating the aliens, does that mean you're eating alien meat?
 (Comment rejected)
Finally, we can stop trying to pet the dog, and can be the dog. Donation goes toward Lizstar's Glorious CGA heckscape for Megaman 3.
I'm convinced the luck in this Animorphs run is Keiz is cashing in every last bit of karma he's earned over the past four years and I FEAR for the karmic whiplash his runner-up is going to suffer.I'm donating to get Chat% in Cybergenic Ranger. That game is... special.
Who let the dogs out?
Are we sure animorphs isn't already joke%?#poyo2020
The world record holder watching Keiz play this game must be like when I try to help my grandparents use a new phone. My condolences.Putting this toward maximum Hydralide jokes to help us recover from this ordeal.<3 Keizaron
I am learning so much about animals here today. Hork Bajirs are so majestic.
The Joke must flow!
This year is my first time tuning in to AGDQ live, AND my first time donating! Awful games for a great cause - what could be better? This donation is in honor of my uncle who died of prostate cancer - I wish I'd had the opportunity to know him better. Keep up the great work, and GO FAST!
This is my first time seeing Animorphs, but it's only fitting that Keiz would be playing it. Love ya lots! Dog is the best!
Keizaron! Keizaron! Keizaron!
When we banish cancer, can Animorphs go with it?
Hey Keiz and Couch, since we're playing a game about morphing into animals, answer this for me - if you could be an animal, which animal would you be and why?
Late night GDQ hype! Here's to fixing the whole cancer thing.
Love awful block!
The good games block is my favourite block!
So hype to finally see the ending to Animorphs! Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!
We have been watching this for many years and love the charity! Yesterday we lost our Aunt Erin to Cancer and She will be very missed. So this one's for you Auntie Erin we will always love and miss you!
let's beat the cancer together ! Awesome and incredible event. Cheer to everyone !
As you can tell from my tag combined with Keizaron's runs tonight, I'm apparently destined to run this game. Thanks for showing me my holy grail of games; it's TRANSFORMED me!
Keiz playing Animorphs might just be the perfect run for 3:30 in the morning. Who needs sleep when there's cancer to beat?!
Good luck Keizaron. 2020 smarter and better. Oh an animorphs run maybe 2021 is your year instead. #goldeenking
joke% plz..?
DOG DOG DOG DOG
Donating for awful awful block!
I love watching keiz suffer, and this goes to Joke %
i have no idea what's going on but dolphin is my new favourite pokemon
Let's get that Joke%
Heck yeah, Awful Block is my favorite time of the week. All these games are so trippy and bad that it's gonna feel like a fever dream. Give me those bad games!
So excited for awful block, where the runs are the best but the games are just the worst. Kudos to the runners, who risk their sanity for our entertainment.
Untitled Keizaron Game: It's a lovely day at the marathon, and you've brought a terrrible game. Honk!
Matching $5 for each shark and squid game over. And for joke%.Why are we doing this again?
Good luck with hitting the time estimate. So thankful for the best guys in my life Owen and Stefan for bringing GDQ into my life. What an amazing cause. My grandmother just passed a few months ago from cancer. She fought a long time and hopefully we can beat it all together.
Love AGDQ and love this run! Amazing job so far Keizaron, can we start a $5 dono train at 35 minutes? lets get this Joke% incentive met!!!
SQUID SQUID SQUID
I can't believe what I'm seeing! A Keizaron run with the potential to go under estimate?
LETS GO SQUID SHARK OR DOLPHIN OR WHATEVER ANIMAL IS RELAVENT AT THE TIME
at least its better than non-super Hydelide!
This game is animorphing into a pile of doo-doo!
We NEED Joke% because I worked forever on making the--oh, uhh, you'll see. But you'll only see it if you donate! GO JOKE% GO GO GO
This Animorphs speedrun is WILD! Put this donation towards Super hydlide, Edo did say please.
Hey Keiz. It's me: DIIIIIIOOOOOOO!
Haa ! Je ne connais rien de mieux que d'être réveillé par la douce voix de Kanon commentant ces magnifique jeux incompris ^_^Bon courage et Hydratez-vous !!#Squidt
My daughter is 1 year cancer free last month. Thank you for all you do
The best part of the new year is Awful Block
For the Animorphs run, here's 10 dollars a death. I mean 5 dollars. 1 dollar? Here's 50 bucks, that'll cover it, right? Right?!
Sure I like awful block, let's meet that hydlide incentive
Lions and Tigers and Bear oh Puyo!
Like you said Keizaron $50 over and this is the ground force one commander. Bridget your grounded from AGDQ.
Well, I'll donate a further $100 if Keizaron finishes within 10 minutes of estimate.
Like Jacob, who stayed too long transformed into a bird, we are all slowly losing our humanity right now.Woof woof?
Inspired by the magnificence of Animorphs, I donate to the most super of hylides!
I LOVE AWFUL BLOCK
jokes
Edobean hosting and awful block, two of my favorite things together! Donation to joke % and a puyo~
We always make Keiz do the Jynx cry... can we hear Keiz do some animorphs cries?
JOKE% or bust
My favorite morph is five.
Yes! Awful block!I didn't catch the first Animorphs boss fight -- hopefully we'll have more than a 3/4 play through this time!Going for the VVVVVV 100% incentive -- I want to see the runner get *that* collectible. You know the one! ;)

I'm not sure what the official Dex number of Dog is, but I honestly don't think it matters
Fail at animorphs again Keiz
So Mike is staying in bed for his run right?
Hey keiz. ya know i come to watch you for wholesome family content and i catch you playing Animorphs! woah to put the kids to bed. Good luck in the rest of the run
...But I don't have a spare $1500 to donate for my favourite animorph: PikeVegeta
Dex number of favorite morph? Well I guess I'll go with my old RP character's Pokéform of Squirtle
Here's seven dollars for my personal favourite: Turtle!
It was totally worth staying up for this
Dog can’t do it. Wolf can’t do it. Better call Goose. HONK!
You don't need to convince me anymore, I will get this game and speedrun it, just so I can feel as miserable as Keiz
Can we get an AWOOOO from the crowd for our MVP morph Wolf?!
Hey AGDQ, first time donator, long time viewer. Shoutout to all the AGDQ team and the runners, and additional shoutout to my friend, Bede. Money goes to naming the X/Y Lucario "AnimeDoggo"! We all know it's true.
Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Wolf! Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!
Thank you, Keizaron and GDQ, for bringing the horror/delight that is Animorphs into our lives.
My favorite animorph is Kys himself~!
Is it too late to change it back to Bonus Game 3?
Donating 5$ every time he has to enter that code - donating $25 ahead of time to cover the next few resets. Go keiz!
Keizaron dying to a Hork-Bajir? Animorphs going over estimate? Not sure if this is a fever dream or not, but take my money anyhow. Animorphs is still a better love story than Virtual Hydlide.
Very glad I stayed up till 4am to watch Keiz play the best game. What a talented runner he is.
Can we get a shoutout to K.A. Applegate for this breathtaking Animorphs run? And can I get an "Eat the fish" from the crowd?
Not sure what dex number spikevegeta is in animorphs, but here is 15 dollars
Just learned of an incredible feature in Animorphs for Game Boy Color: the game uses the "Ubi Key", a feature in "most every UbiSoft Game Boy Color game" but that I've never heard of before. Allegedly with this feature, you can use other UbiSoft games to unlock hidden features and games in Animorphs, as well as use Animorphs to unlock hidden levels and games in other UbiSoft titles. With two Game Boy Colors and the power of those little infrared ports on their tops. The More You Know[tm]
Need more gdq and terrible games and what's the dex number for shark
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!
I don't know what the dex number for snake is, but the dex number for ekans is 23 and ekans is snake spelled backwards so that counts, right? Awesome run Keizaron!
Awful block is my fav part of gdq. I look forward to these events all year, I stream the runs I missed at work and have never speed run any game myself I just enjoy watching and being blown away by all the runners. Its 4am in toronto right now but I booked well today off work just t stay tuned in. Thanks all for your hard work putting these events together. I'll donate 20 if this gets read live!
<You'll never make it.>
Over estimate donation train? Over estimate donation train. Let's get joke%!
I have to stay up to watch Castle of Dragon, but donating early to get that joke% happening. Many years ago I was at a random thrift store with my friend where we spotted a NES game for two bucks. The name of this game? Castle of Dragon. Never has two dollars been more wasted than on that purchase. I can't wait to see what the second level looks like.
this might be a mistake
DOG! GOAT! CAT! CHIMPANZEE! ELEPHANT! S- spider?
Must get incentive!
Lets get the joke.
Must see joke%!!!
dog dog dog dog dog dog dog
I guess I need this joke in my life.
50 dollars for going over estimate. Now that's the GDQ we know and love!

This one's for Patty for having to handle the crowd after this.
Fun Fact: Animorphs was my first ever game. Somehow I still like games
To an amazing Keizaron run and Super Hydlide Joke %
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!
put it towards Super Hydlide joke%
finally got a stable job so able to finally donate, animorphs run was hilarious and hyped! hope we make that hydlide joke run!
As promised! That was a great Animorphs run...and the commentary was pretty good too.
Going over estimate just means more fun, right?
CLOSE ENOUGH TAKE MY MONEY
The first Animorph book I ever read was #23. And that's a special one for Tobias, so that's as good a dex entry as any.On a more serious note, I just want to thank all of you for making me smile as you strive so hard to do what you can to fight cancer. I lost my aunt... and several other family members to cancer over the years. Usually it's best to just not think about it, but this event always brings both a smile to my face and tears to my eyes. It's not much, but I can live off of ramen for a week. Please never stop doing your best to help others. I know the game is a hot mess, but also thank you for letting Kiezeron play it again. Good luck to everyone. May your runs be swift and your rng be kind. Game on
That Pokemon Game we've just seen was weird...Greetings From Germany!
GDQ is the best way to start the new year, this one is for my girl Jemma!No cancer luckily, she's just the best.
My mom had the luck to survive cancer some years ago. I hope that this small donation will also help others to be lucky as me as well. This event is awesome and I watch it now for years. Save the animals! Kick the butt of cancer!
DOG! DOG! DOG! yknow, all of the animorphs would have survived in the books if dog was there.
Greetings from x! GDQ Donation-isms!
Who's that Pokémon?It's Dog!
Hork! Hork! Hork! Honk! Hork!
So looking forward Super Hydlide. It's probably my favourite game that can be measured in frame per second.
No comment. Is that how this works?
All Hail Aweful Block
Sent needs to go to bed, stop presenting prizes and get some sleep. Enough sleep will prevent many things. It will also indirectly cure cancer! Keep playing and keep on the research!
This Animorphs run was hilarious, an awesome way to support a great cause.Good luck to all the runners, except for Awful Block ones when bad RNG is funnier.
Super Hydlide was one of my favourite games as a kid.I was not a smart child.Donation goes to playing the best Mega Man game in CGA.Because I'm also not a smart adult.
Awful Block Best Block! Shoutouts to all of my speedfriends, who I have way too many to count. This is gonna be the best night ever!
Bless this mess.
Yay for the excellent awful games block!
Awful block is my favorite block. Staying up all night for these terrible games. They may be awful, but not as awful as cancer!
Hey Guys, Sent is losing his mind and I'm beside myself smiling at these crazy prizes. I love awful block and I want those Rocky and Bullwinkle perlers!
Sent and Caveman are an amazing duo. More Caveman.
Animorphs broke me just enough to watch the rest of the awful block. Good luck to the runners and all of us watching!
4a.m GDQ best GDQ
Awful Block is my favorite time of the year and I had to donate something during it.
Awful block is awesome and not all that awful.
 (Comment rejected)
I just want to say: you are "THE MAN"
Not sure if it's because it's late or because everything looks good after Animorphs, but I absolutely loved the Cent & Caveman duo prize block!
Clairement le meilleur block de l'évènement.Et Kanon toujours au top. Des bisous #MarioLight
sup
Donating because tired Sent is amazing. As is awful block.
I'm sad I can't stay up for Awful Games Block, but I'll look forward to the VODs! Good luck with all that lovely hot garbage <3
Awful Games Done Quick? More like... uh... no yeah awful is pretty accurate.
Awful games, I've always needed you but never knew it.
I woke up at 4am to pay fifty bucks to tell Patty hi. Hi, Patty.
good morning patty!
I did this for the guy named Matt that's stuck in the lobby. If you see him, give him a thumbs up!
As the dragon molts from the princesse, nothing can amount to the epic that is awful block. But really... what is the plot of cybergenic ranger?
Never have I been so pleased to have insomnia, because the Awful Block is something no one should miss.
Wait so if this is the official start of awful block, does this mean animorphs was a good game?
Happy to be awake for this! I first played Super Hydlide shortly after completing VIRTUAL hydlide on Saturn years ago, (because I apparently I'm a glutton for punishment.)I can personally attest this is an insane-train of a game & Watching someone else suffer through it is SO much more fun. Thanks for enduring it all for a great cause. when it's all over be good to yourself. pet a puppy. have a drink. ...you'll need it.
KONO DIO DA
PATTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTY!!!!!!! My fav announcer during my favorite segment awful block I'm so happy I booked tomorrow off! its 4am in toronto aswell....HYDLYDE! GET READY TO DROP SOME FRAMES!!!! 10 DOLLARS MORE IF THIS GETS READ ALOUD

"It's a joke!!"
What the hell. What the hell.
I'm a game designer and love the Awful Games Block, it provides so many glimpses back into an era of when any idea was good enough to make a game out of.Keep up the good work.
Staying up late to support my favourite block and my favourite host!
uga uga uga UGA UGA UGA
Give me a L!Give me a U!Give me a C-K-Y!

This still counts, right?
Good to see my big brother being played live! Here's a dollar for every frame in me!
Lads on the couch, scratch your ear and smile if you’re being held against your will.
Every year I think awful block couldn’t get any weirder, but here I am crossing my fingers that ’Hell Smoke’ sits still long enough to be stabbed. Thanks for all your (great?) work.
Super Hydlide is definitely #bestlyde! Good luck to Mike and his Sing-a-long! Oh, and the game he's playing too. Shoutouts to Awful block, the BEST block, and everyone who runs kuso. Especially you, Mike, Liz, NPC, Auth, and anyone I missed.
Donation goes to naming Lucario “Oreo.” My dog and best friend whom cancer stole from me too soon. Save the frames and remember the animals.
Shout out to the U person behind the couch... NO, U! I love U!
King Dragon sends his regards.
Big thanks to Mike for introducing me to Super Hydlide. It is one of the most interesting and high quality games I've ever TASed....It's a joke!!!!!

My mother passed away from large cell lung cancer back in September this is for her and the hope to prevent cancer in the future
No comment. There's nothing here. It's just blank. Nada. Nothing. Zilch. Why even bother? It's absolutely, positively blank. As if there was nothing here at all. Never was, never is, never will be.It's a joke!
we NEED more fanart of these bad games!!
Patty, why do you torment yourself with the Awful Block like this? As a reward for your persistence, please choose which incentive this donation should go towards. Have fun everyone, and may this GDQ break records!
Super Hydlide? You mean Super HYPELIDE!
Greetings from Australia. I had to donate during the worst part with the worst runner with the worst couch and the worst host... but IT'S A JOKE!
Dont die 3 steps away from the Inn please. Hydlide is the King of games.
It's a me!
Biographers years from now will be able to describe this night of my life in great detail as follows:IT'S A JOKE!!!!

What sound does a frog make? ITS A CROAK!
Hey all, so glad to donate during an already hilarious Awful Block. It's a sad AGDQ this year, having lost my Dad to his second bout of cancer last year, but it's foundations like this that helped him beat his first bout and gave us more years with my Dad.Keep telling those jokes and grinding those monsters - much love.
I couldn't sleep, so I decided to watch the Awful Games Block. Mike Uyama is making this hilarious and awesome, so I had to donate. Donation goes to Mike's choice, and that's no joke!
Thank you for awesome event! Let's beat cancer!
As the awful block began, I promised my friends who had to sleep I'd report back. But how am I supposed to even begin to describe Animorphs, let ALONE Hydlide?? Thank you GDQ for keeping me company through my own struggles with chronic illness. And, also, Honk.
You thought this was a joke, but it was me, DIO!
What period was Bach writing music in again? It's BAROQUE!!!

just beat dark souls for the first time, feeling good and though I'd share some love, thank you for everything
First donation from a french guy! Thanks for all your work agdq, you're brightening my week.
Awful games block never disappoints.
What did the monk say in the bathtub?"IT'S A SOAK!"
Thank you for the awful block stream while I am stuck being awake from a sore throat. You are all good blokes.
Even when I’m broke I make sure I always have some money left to donate to agdq. Good luck runners and announcers.
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos! This marks the most our community has ever donated to GDQ in a single event! Good luck to all of the Kuso runners, and shout out to the crowd and tech crew on this late night shift! Let's enjoy something deeply terrible together.
We need mega man CGA. All these other games just have too many bits.
Hi everyone.Five years ago my father died of lung cancer. And I hope one day, we wont know what cancer actually was. I love this event, good luck to all the runners and greetings from Germany!
loving the speedruns. I didn't know games could go this fast! mindblow equals gained.
Hey Dowolf, good luck on your run. Here's hoping you fail all the teleports.
I didn't get a final count for butt-clenches, but it was close enough to 30. Donated 10 for a joke earlier, so this'll meet the rest of my $1.37/clench.
I'm living up to my promise and rounding up a bit. 28 is actually a low number of butt clenches and heart attacks for a super hydlide run. That was a great crowd and I kept it fabulous. #keepinittight #keepitawful
Mais non personne n'aime Isaac!IT'S A JOKE!!!#IsaacLou
merci a vous comme tout les 6 mois #isaaclou
I haven't had my eyes bleed in awhile. Let's get that CGA incentive!
Courage au FrenchRestream et merci de couvrir les GDQ chaque années !#IsaacLou
Ahh yes, the sufferening. Time for "Bad Gaims Did Hastily"! But you must endure! Defeat the ultimate enemy beyond the bad games! (Roomies told me to stop buying Gunpla, so here is my mecha budget for the month!)
Congrats on making it to the big stage, Dowolf. Don't spend too much staring at stars, else you might start thinking this success is a failure!
Just to remind everyone that dowolf went from running Half Minute Hero, one of the fastest RPGs at last SGDQ... To THIS. I love it! Good luck and stay Awful, everyone!
One of my favorite parts of attending GDQ events was always getting cozy with friends and witnessing the awful and silly game blocks into the wee hours of the morning. Sad I couldn't be there, but shoutouts to my friends in the front row, and also Marnie says hi!
#TempeteDivine
I don't have much, but I will Matching) match ten thousand dollar donations for each couch commentator who can rip a phone book in half with their earlobes.Lost several grandparents to cancer. No more. Incentive goes to host' choice.
Had to donate during Awful block. Good luck to all the runners and may the bad games be ever good.
This game is making me go insane.
Happy 32nd birthday laser girl! Here's to many more years of late night GDQ cuddles. And, you know... Defeating cancerPut this donation towards runner's choice
Hoshi wo Miru Hito is the best RPG made for any system. Forget FF7 remake — where’s my high-budget HD version of this?...IT’S A JOOOOOOKE!
Long time watcher, second time donating, and what better reason than finally seeing the ending to Animorphs? Awful Block is always a highlight to my year! Had to put this towards Chat% as soon as I saw that wonderful box art. I refused to spoil it for myself, but I know I'm in for a treat after overhearing my girlfriend's reactions to looking into the game. Good luck to all the runners, and thank you to everyone in this block for suffering through these games for our enjoyment (and a good cause!)
I don't know what I'm watching but heres a donate for the efforts. Honk
Hi Dowolf!!! This run is awesome! Also let’s get vvvvvv to 100%
Pretty sure it's pronounched Mike UwU-yama
At last - my favorite block of games. IT'S A JOKE! No, it's not, and here's my contribution because cancer is no joke.
I thought I was watching "Awesome" games done quick. Dear God, what am I watching at 6 in morning? This is absolutely not Awesome, this is awefully hilarious. $10 for my favorite block during gdq.
Fun fact for those of you who are new to GDQs. Awful block was originally started because everyone was trying to stay up and watch as much content as possible and the GDQ staff wanted to have a late night block that no one would want to watch so everyone could go get some sleep. It failed spectacularly on it's inaugural year of 2012 and I am happy to say that it has failed spectacularly 8 years later. Awful Block, Best Block
My wife and I just had a baby last week, and AGDQ has been amazing to watch during these late night feeding sessions. Thanks for all that you do. I'd like my daughter to live in a cancer-free world one day. Good luck runners!
This Awful Block is a national treasure.
I love the Awful Block, it's always a blast watching bad games from silly to downright horrendous being broken apart!
Go Auth! Clip through all the walls and save all the girlfriends!
video games?
The games in this awful block so far have been awful... awfully fun to watch!Dedicating this donation to my mom - she lost both her kidneys to cancer last year but has stayed strong through everything that's happened and we're thankfully close to the 1 year cancer free mark!Good luck and have fun everyone, let's kick cancer straight to the moon <3Also shoutout to the person in the crowd in the pizza onesie
loving the speedruns. i didn't know games could go this fast! mindblow equals gained.
Always a pleasure watching noted cool guy authorblues transmute garbage into entertainment. Good luck with the run! Donation goes to runner's choice.
Awful Block is the only appropriate way to start off a Thursday.
That Hoshi wo Miru Hito run was great! So glad I woke up to see it!
Wow... I was not expecting the ending to be that bad.... That was truly aweful. Also $5 train of horribliness for the Mega Man in CGA
Since it's awful block does that mean we can tell awful jokes as well? How does a Hamburger introduce his/her girl/boyfriend? .... meet Patty
Special shout out to TieTuesday for showing me The wonders of sword of the black stone for the first time. Good luck to all the awful block runners.
Am always grateful that I can spend the week watching with my Slime friends and having a good time, and supporting a wonderful cause! All the runs have been great so far, looking forward to more beautifully awful games!
Long time donator, first time watcher! Wait a second... It's a joke!! Good luck to the runners! Awful Block is always my favorite!
I love watching the AGDQ and SGDQ events and the awesome runs. I wish I could do more, but at least it helps.
I got 4 words for you, Auth - Jeans Toadette, or Joadette. Love from your mods, your chat, and Hubie.
It's been a while since I could dontate, but with a new year and a new job comes new opportunities to support PCF while I watch some, video games...yes.Money towards beautiful CGA Incentive.Also, Hi Patty.

Good luck and have fun to author "story wrangler" blues. (hashtag: Fix Tachi's Hips)
awful games make for GREAT content. Money goes wherever Patty wants it since he has to suffer ;)
Nice to see DeviantArt made a game.
Can we get some more Daytona tunes for Patty between this and the upcoming run? Lots of love for all of you doing the nightshift! DAYYYYTOOOOONAAAAAAAA!!!!
This is the first GDQ I've been able to watch with my dad, who wishes he could be there with his friends in the front row for cozy awful block all the way into true gamer hours.
Awful block, so bad its good. To watch at least.
Lizstar's run of Megaman Dos in 2019 was the first time I'd ever heard of GDQ, and since then my life has been enlightened to the true glory of CGA. All Clory to CGA.
Enjoying the Awful block! Look forward to hearing the "soundtrack" of Rocky and Bullwinkle on GDQ. :)
Donating $25 for the 25% of the screen not blocked by the characters and weapons in Sword of the Black Stone.
Looking forward to seeing someone finally beat the Barbie game! The jukebox level always defeated my sister Katie and me, and now we will have our revenge!
Love AGDQ
So glad I could catch some of the Awful Block at work this morning. Thanks to all the runners for giving me so much confused laughs. Always one of the best blocks of GDQ. Will donate an extra 50 if Patty can offer up one of his best dolphin impressions.
These graphics are really kicking in my nostalgia for Vanilla Everquest. Love Awful Block!
The new motto for Awful Block "I'm sorry for what's going on on-screen right now"
Sorry folks, we don't want to be here any more than you do. Please, take us with you! Save us!
J'ai fait un don hier mais j'avais oublié le FR donc j'en refais un ! Kanon on t'aime pour ta folie, continue comme ca ^^ it is NOT a joke #LonaLink
Long time watcher, first time donator, and I always knew it had to be during Awful Block: Now That's What I Call Video Games Volume 10. GDQ, you're great, and here's to 10 more years.
The music in Sword of the Black Stone is so beautiful that my brain is leaking out of my skull, thank you for blessing my night with this pure majesty.
The games in this awful block so far have been awful... awfully fun to watch!Dedicating this donation to my mom - she lost both her kidneys to cancer last year but has stayed strong through everything that's happened and we're thankfully close to the 1 year cancer free mark!Good luck and have fun everyone, let's kick cancer straight to the moon <3Also shoutout to the pizza onesie guy in the crowd

Staying up overnight to see this 600% run of Wild Animal Sports Day! Best mistake of my life, I'm sure. Looking forward to seeing this Castle of Dragon run too!
Is that PATTY on the mike? They allowed you back? Don't you dare to bully my man Andy again on his run - twitch chat will bully him enough.... you big bully you!
Pour lutter contre le cancer , soutenir les casteurs et aussi voir encore des run sur Sword of the Black Stone

Got a day off from work, and I'm enjoying it by watching this awful games block! Perfect day off in my opinion 😁 greetings from Portugal!
I just saw Gusto's run in Mushihime and had to donate. The most insane run of anything i have ever seen at AGDQ
There is no better way to spend a sick day than watching so many Guardians take on the Cancer heroic raid. Here's to cancer being destroyed by the Architechts.
Shout outs to Wizardry Force.
*insert witty donation comment here*
I hope the audio people are ready to raise the volume when it's time for Rocky & Bullwinkle. Time for the best music of the event! Good luck Coolkid and everyone else participating in this awesome event. Keep it up everyone. Much love. /Tootoo
How nice is it to wake up to Awful Block? Pretty dang nice.
Since I'm still up at this ungodly hour exclusively for the Awful Block, I may as well donate a few more smackaroonis. Thanks to all the runners for playing these horrendous games so we don't have to!
As promised donated earlier this week while my favorite announcer patty was on heres another 5 dollary doos for the greatest time of GDQ .
Red dragon mahjong tile.
Had to donate during Awful Block, Patty you make a me laugh.
All aboard the CGA Mega Man 3 DOS train! The train is going straight to eyestrain!
Every year I say to myself I'll turn on the Awful Block while I'm drawing. Then I wind up being too enthralled by the weirdness on screen to actually do anything productive. Thank you all for gracing us with this... content.
Awful Block Best Block!
I need to make sure my incentive gets met!
choo choo
what did I start watching???
I really enjoy the AGDQ and I again don't know to write a very funny pun.
Baby Shark DuDuDuDuDu
As always, awful block is awfully entertaining!PS: Mega Man 3 doesn't deserve EGA.
Awful block is the best block! Let's get that CGA in MM3!
This is my lifeblood. Inject me with more trash.
I thought What Remains of Edith Finch was the most emotional use of Waltz of the Flowers in a video game. I was wrong.
 (Comment rejected)
Nothing like watching a terrible game after no sleep. Love you zic sneaky and scrublord and Bullets, I’m proud of all of you on your dedication to optimizing an amazing game

Gotta donate during the Awful Block. It is just too entertaining. Best of luck to all the runners. Kill the animals Save the frames
what is the incentive to mute a game?
Rocky & Bullwinkle is the worst game I owned as a kid. It taught me games could be bad. I'll never forgive it. Here's 25 bucks for defeating it.
"Hey Rocky, Watch me pull a donation out of my hat""But that trick never works"
OverClocked ReMix Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle remix project when? Awful block is best block <3
I look forward to this spectacular block every year, so I wish i could have donated more. thank you to gdq and coolkid from victoria, Australia
i couldn't last a full minute with the sound up so i'm paying for my crimes
My dog was scared and I had to turn the sound down. Consider this my penance.
could i just get one "ORRRRBBBBBBB" from the people at gdq
When I was a kid, my brother convinced me to get Rocky & Bullwinkle instead of Mega Man 5...he feels guilty about it to this day. GGs to Coolkid for playing such a janky game.
I know it's early in the morning but can we get some HYPE.Also, golden deer best fire emblem house.
Awful block is best block. Anyone can speedrun "good" games. Only the best can take on these monsters.
I never knew I needed Chat% in my life, but I do, and here we are. Take my money!
Blink twice if you need to be rescued.
Awful Block is one of the few things that will get me out of bed THIS early. Take my moose money!
Where's my car?

Must see all dialogue
Please pretend I wrote something very witty and entertaining here.
I wanna see that chat%!
Glad I've had a chance to catch some of Awful Games Block this morning! And, yes, the robots are, in fact, revolting, especially in glorious CGA!
Show me that glorious, eye searing CGA!
haven't missed an awful block in 3 years :)
Credit to the speedrunners in awful block: they've taken games no one has ever any fun with, and somehow turned them into games everyone can enjoy, at least for a little while, and even use them for a good cause.
Oh Awful Block, I look forward to you every year and you never disappoint. Shame work's keeping me from fully enjoying it, but here's a donation to make up for it!
Voici mon dernier don que je peut faire ,jai gardé les sous pour le meilleurs Block Ever et le meilleur commentateur EVER!!mais si sa peut aider tant mieux (en ayant un membre de la famille morte du cancer je valide cette initiative!!)#Tempetedesang
Do you think the Power Rangers ever learned Zordon was running a Dino Defenders squad on the side?
People complaining about Rocky and Bullwinkle must've had Black Stone muted. Embrace the pain, AGDQ!
Lizstar's run of Megaman DOS was a highlight last year. We have to see the sequel.
Glad i got off work in time for my favorite block of games. Suck it cancer.
A sonic and jurassic park crossover is mind ascending
Jurassic Park 3: Dino Defenders is a great game! See, nobody cares.
Greetings from US night shift! Awful Block has kept me grinning all night long and I've been asked more than once on shift why I'm laughing. Thanks for keeping the graveyard shift sane(?)
It wasn’t until Jurassic Park III that somebody figured out you can defeat velociraptors by throwing rocks at them. We could have saved so many lives.
This game is the best and most beautiful game ever. Seriously, look at it. Sike! IT'S A JOOOOOKE!!! Also, put that money into the audience singing Snake Eater while on the ladder.
What is going on? I woke up to king giraffe flying away and now Alpha-5 is fighting dinosaurs. I'm so confused...
Obligatory first time donator comment. Awful block is always my favorite part of GDQ!
Love awful block for showing love to some forgotten games. :-)
These games have been awful but in a great way. Great job to all this week. Incentive goes towards Mega Man 3 CGA because anything more than 4 bits of color is just too many.
This block has the best runs of the event! Love to all those awesome runners! And love to my boyfriend who is the best run in my event!
Thanks to the runners & staff for these 10 years of GDQ. We can help fight against cancer, let's donate ! <3[ Bourrons les dons ! Sus au Cancer !! Ensemble nous vaincronsMerci aux participants de nous faire profiter de ces GDQ en FR, les commentaires et l'ambiançage sont vraiment super Kanon + Awful = Le meilleur de la GDQ, que de l'amour & de la folie.A défaut d'avoir eu Lionel, bourrons André #MarioLight
I unironically love CGA and I don't care who knows it!
hey guys ive just popped into stream and wanted to put some money towards the cause
How do you find such a wonderful game and why did it make me donate so I can mount that poster directly above my bed?
Bonjour, merci pour ce beau moment.Voici mon meilleur calembour: "J'ai vu de la lumière, je suis André"#Goupix
Currently at work here in Dublin, listening to commentary in a minimised window, please say hello to Lianne and Peadar, my wife and three year old son watching at home. Love you both lots and lots, from Joe
Deuxième don pour la partie la plus rude et la plus fun de l'AGDQ, gardez la pêche et continuez de bourrez les dons ! #CoeurNoir
I normally wait til horror block to donate, but this time let's start the horror early with some CGA. Greetings from the audience!
Toujours un grand moment le bloc awful, force à Kanon et à tous les commentateurs! #LonaLink
 (Comment rejected)
will this get me a poster?also how do i vote against CGA, it was CGA last time
If it's wrong to be donating now specifically for a chance at a boxed copy of Cybergenic Ranger, then I don't want to be right. Much love to the SteamGoons!
Awful block is just my favorite moment of the week, and boy does it deliver this year as always. Donation goes to The Sun And Moon All Bosses, so that our frenchman Gyoo can shine it's brightest !
BUUUURRRP
No one can prevent *this* eye cancer. bring on the CGA!
SAVE THE RHEA
Good luck with the hundreds of strategic decisions! Glad you get the chance to show this off to such a big audience. Also: Doom Tube!
Good luck to all the runners and thanks to the team another great GDQ! HI MIKE!
OWWWWWWWWWWW!!

What did I just watched...Anyway keep up the good work guys.Cheers from Poland.
#zhtSonicMerci le chat, pardon, les commentateurs pour votre humour et votre expertise
These games in awful block look WAY too nice. This donation goes towards getting us some sweet sweet CGA.
Greetings esteemed guests. I am curious in how well a game can be run with only four colors. Good luck to Liz and all of the other Awful Block runners.
Shout out from Kentucky and from the Arcade Legacy gang. I can't tell which is worse -- this or Tag-in Dragon!
I'm glad that we can take a little time out of the week for a block that can highlight the some of the most entertaining games out there. And I really mean OUT there.Let's remove some color from mega man 3
'Mega Man 3' was my first Mega Man game, although I think it may have had a few more colors.
CGA hoyeeeeep!
Cybergenic Ranger is not a very good game.
"The Robots Are Revolting?". Not revolting enough! Moar CGA!
Wait, chatting with enemy monsters? Is this a Shin Megami Tensei game in disguise?
Mega Man CGA needs to happen.
This run isn't going as wrong as it could... You never know, the console could spontaneously combust, or this game could just crash...
Petit don pour soutenir André le Géant, un des meilleurs catcheur de l'existence, et pour envoyer mon énergie à Kanon qui est en train de faire passer les Awfull Game... Par dessus la troisième corde!!!#ParraPluie
Hey everyone! Really appreciate this Awful games block, keep on going, we can hit that CGA incentive! Greetings from Osaka.
Let's get that glorious CGA!
NPC, you are a treasure, but you have to restart to qualify, you missed talking to the chicken on level 2. .....IT'S A YOLK! Thank you for an edge of my seat run, donation goes to NPC's choice!
Got home from work in time to catch some of the awful game block, and I have to get my donation in time to celebrate the best stretch of the marathon. Let's get that CGA!
Greetings. Wanted to say thank you to everyone working on and behind the scenes at GDQ. And all the people I have probably forgotten, too. :D
My dad subjected be to mega Man dos when I was a kid, and now I'm subjecting my kid to it. Shout outs from the front row!

I love Mega Man!! I haven't played the DOS games, but how bad could they be? Kappa
What the heck are those games?!
Awful block has given me such joy over the years that I have to help share the joy. So lets have the CGA megaman to give the joy of 4 colors
Great Event. Great People. Great Cause. Keep up the good work!
Awful Block is always a highlight of GDQ. Love it! Thanks to all the runners for putting up with these games, and for the hilarious commentary.
I always love the awful block
AAAAAAAUGH MY EYESIT'S SO... BEAUTIFUL...
Ready to see a run of the REAL Mega Man 3.

It's all good fun suffering together.
MY EYES! MY EYEEEEEEEEES!
Oh, boy, this game. The castle is a super fun time that has to be done FLAWLESSLY! Lizstar gets to choose the incentive.
Love Agdq, Good Luck to all the Runners. HONK
Premier don de ma part sur l'événement, je connaissais l'AGDQ de nom mais je m'y suis interessé de plus près grâce au vieux monsieur qu'on ne présente plus, Mister MV, c'est impressionnant et frustrant à la fois de voir les jeux de mon enfance se faire atomiser par les runners. Continuez c'est génial et l'initiative est très noble! :) #GDQup
I have no idea what game is being played right now, but here's 25 dollars to buy some sunscreen. Hello from Maryland via Louisiana.
Hello everyone from France ! It's my 5th AGDQ and it's still a blast ! Thank you to all the runners and everyone taking part in this awesome event ! Kill the HONKS !! (am I doing this right?)
HONK!
Wave Man Ga Taosenai
My father died of cancer last year. I hope cancer will be defeated one day and with your help it is possible. I like your event and the speed runs. Great work for a good cause! Love is with you guys.
Here's to us! And CGA Mega Man!
Lizstar's Megaman DOS run was the first speedrun I ever saw from GDQ, and I've been hooked on speedruns ever since! Donation goes to whatever this wonderful runner wants!
I had this Mega Man 3 as a kid because I thought it would be like the NES game. It was not. Props to Lizstar for running this “classic”!
Why does Mega Man 3 DOS look like an Andy Warhol experiment?
Good morning AGDQ! What... we Lizstar first thing in the morning? My work day just started on a fantastic note! Chat, remember to stay hydrated! 800K HONK!
I had to donate after watching Mega Man fall repeatedly from that set of blocks in Blade Man's stage, a metaphor for life itself. Truly, video games are art.
Go Liz!
CGA Megaman says trans rights! When the colours are only 4, then the fun for all is even more!good luck on the run and i hope you have a lot of fun!!!!
i woke up in the MORNING for this so i hope y'all appreciate how much i love mega man DOS and lizstar. donation to runner's choice
That colour scheme, it rings a bell... MegaMan says Trans Rights? Thanks for this amazing run, this is glorious!
So. Megaman 3 is the second Game on DOS and Megaman X ist the third game.Yes. Yes this makes total sense.Greetings from Germany.- Slowpoke
So brave to play Mega Man 3 without killing the win key. Great job!
We get to see.... Whatever this is again... Yay? Love watching Lizstar and the hot garbage she plays but I have to ask, Liz... Who hurt you?
Congrats to Lizstar on an amazing run of the best Mega Man game! Press Windows Key to pay respects.
The mouse cursor really adds to the experience of Mega Man on DOS, it reminds me of all of the let's plays that I watched on YouTube when I was very young where the mouse cursor was on screen along with Unregistered HyperCam 2
The mouse is love, the mouse is life!
Why is this in the awful block? This is beautiful!
Good Luck Jack Reynolds!
So where does this game fit into the canon of the classic Mega Man story?
CGA? More like "C G Ahhh No My Eyes Are On Fire"
Maybe the real Mega Man 3 on DOS was the friends we made along the way.
Megaman DOS!?! Aw Man, here we go again.Lets get Bonus Game 4 met.
We got Mega Man 4-6 relay earlier. When are we going to get the Mega Man DOS 1, 3, X relay?
Thank you, Megaman CGA, for making me think my entryphone was ringing at one point.
Do they sell the OST for that Megaman game on vinyl?
Good morning from France! Took a day off to watch awful games block and I regret nothing! Go awful games!
Can't watch Claris's run live but look forward to watching her do Verdant Wind! Fear the Deer!

Do I hear Blueglass in the crowd??
For the Emperor!#CoeurNoir
I've made a terrible decision to listen to all these harsh beeps and boops while hungover. But nothing will stop me from watching the awful games block.Rock on GDQ.
Can someone tell Authorblues that Bubsy 3D totally belongs in awful block.
Mooooooooo... Oh wait, no Diablo II run this GDQ? Ah well, at least there's Rocky & Bullwinkle: Moooooooooose!
No not the famous one, but had to donate during the awful block. Best part of GDQ every year!
I picked Miracle Ropit for Brossentia to play, so in a sense I’m responsible for it being in your eyeballs right now. I apologize for nothing. XD
Get in the robot smartball
Greetings from Brazil!
Loving the awful games block. Always amazed at how dedicated you folks can be to having a terrible time. Tha ks for making my morning awesomely awful.
It’s a sign of a very good game when you can die by hitting the top of the screen. Awful block is best block. #rawr
Is this a D.Va game?
What is this beautiful monstrosity? You can do it Smartball! Awful block is best block.
I spent SO many hours playing and replaying the Barbie game on the gameboy. Here's to breaking one of my favorite childhood games and to a great cause.
Turns out that "AGDQ" was neither the category we asked for nor we knew we needed but i fricking love it!
Long time watching, first time attending and I've been wearing a pink dress all week in honour of the Barbie race, clearly the highlight of this AGDQ. All you beautiful runners, organizers, staff, attendees and watchers, YOU ARE AMAZING, keep up the good work and let's eradicate cancer!
[FR] Voici ma contribution pour cette 10e AGDQ. Des performances hors du commun tant au niveau des runners que des commentaires! Thanks for this amazing, entertaining week.#MarioLight
Dance Dad !!!!
Missed out on my Dancing Dad donation yesterday, making up for it today! Glad he can still find the energy to keep dancing.
Greetings from Germany, first year watching with my girlfriend. I love the events and even schedule my holidays according to the events. I lost my grand dad to cancer and my uncles both had cancer so i know how hard it its to lose someone you love. I always donate to such great cause.
stopped in to watch some awful games, but i cant get over one thing in miracle ropit. the boss just doesn't spawn sometimes? are you sure this belongs in awful block? this is a gem
Huge thank you to AGDQ and PCF for all you do! This donation is dedicated to Glacier's mother who we lost last year to lung cancer. Good luck on your run Sharif!!

Heck yes Barbie run! Glad to see this amazing yet awful game run! Donation goes toward announcer’s choice!

Gotta donate for Sharfers and Cajink's Barbie run. It's not a Sharfers run if there's not amazing jump sounds. Good luck to both of you on the race, and let's help prevent cancer!
So excited to get up early and watch the Cajink & Sharif Barbie race! Life in plastic, it's fantastic!
Very upset to be missing out on awful block because I’m working. But can’t wait to get home and watch Halfcoordinated’s EDF run. Donation goes to the handcam because it’s worth seeing. Love all the work you all do. Good luck to the runners and most importantly HYPE ( or is it Honk now?)
I used a sick day to stay home from work so I could watch the Barbie speed run. NO REGRETS.
Just leaving it here with a quote from one of the best poets of past century:I'm a Barbie girl in a Barbie worldLife in plastic, it's fantasticCome on, Barbie, let's go party! ah ah ah yeahCome on, Barbie, let's go party!ooh oh, ooh oh
Sadly Barbie was the first game I ever beat and it took me much longer to beat it.Awful block is best block.

Donation goes to Final Fantasy VI because Sketch glitch is childhood--Relm is the patron saint of speedrunners, let's give her a chance to shine! Also, let's face it, we're gonna need the palate cleanse after this.
Why is this in Awful Games block though?

Thanks AGDQ for the aweful game block. They are awesome!
That was as impressive as it was bewildering.
J'espère que ces Awful Games vont inspirer des dévs pour des futurs jeux! Bravo à toute l'équipe, continuez comme ça, c'est que du bonheur! #LonaLink
AWFUL BLOCK IS BEST BLOCK.
PLEASE SAVE FOR PETE DOCTOR HAUZER RUNThe runner before you is a close personal friend and mentor of mine. I have never before had someone I can consistently go to and say "hey give me the absolute worst games you got" and then be so stunningly appalled by the titles he shares with me. Pete is truly Lord of the scrap heap and has perfected the art of loving games that deserve some love (and some that don't) good luck Pete, do what you do best. I'm here at work watching! Donation goes to runners choice.
Excited to see Fatal Frame! Watching since 2018, loving the cause and say no to cancer!
Gotta love the "official" unofficial dancers in the front row :3Keep up the great work!
This is my first time watching live and I am enjoying it, I cant wait for the Three Houses Run.
Donating for a great cause and to wish my wonderful friend Ecdycis good luck on his Nightcry speedrun!
[FR] On veut un speed run de Kanon	#DVVol2
Five dollar donation chain: Donate $5 if you stretched and feel way better now!
Had to donate again because the Shovel Knight music playing between runs has me bopping along while I work! AGDQ and Vert are awesome!
Donating to root for my boy PeteDorr!! You got this!
3DO Represent! It’s not Audio. It’s not Video. IT’S 3DO!!!!
Shoutouts to the amazing Linkus7 community. <3
Got to pop the donation cherry sometime, why not now?Go fast, beat cancer!
Wow this 3d movie maker speedrun is cool.
The clock ticks faster than the framerate.
da na naaaaaaaa!
Remember when we used to say "Save the frames, kill the animals"? These are the frames we were trying to save...
Lost a cousin to brain cancer a few years ago. Hope we can have better health option in the future to aid others in need.
This framerate is bending my brain, I keep looking back at the timer and being extremely surprised how little time has passed...you're a real trooper Petedorr.
Doctor Hauzer is a legit great game and I paid ten bucks to make sure everyone knows this.
OH EM GEE! THEE CLG LINKUS7 running?! I'm swooning!
Ca fait des années que j'attends impatiemment le mois de janvier, le froid et la pluie pour pouvoir suivre l'AGDQ dans un plaid et m'endormir au son des voix de l'équipe du French Restream. #zhtDoom pour le Caco trop choupi.
Sneakily watching Awful Block at work as carefully as I would sneak through a booby trapped mansion.
Shoutout to everybody in the audience who made it to the end of the awful block tonight. Thanks for making my first GDQ one to remember.
This is for the Doctor Hauzer speedrun. I still have my original launch 3DO and legit love it. I had no idea this game existed, and am glad to see there was some survival horror representation on the system. I would totally play a remake of this game. Thanks for running it.Donation goes to bonus game 4. More chances to donate!HONK!
Let's Fight Cancer in this amazing way!
I think the devils Nuclear (yes, you!) needs to do some more speedrunning again!!
First time watcher and donator of AGDQ.Sending all the love to not only Ecdysis but to all the speedrunners who are doing this for an awesome cause throughout the week! Let's put an end to cancer! Hype!
It’s-a me, 3DO! Also honk, i guess.

I send a big hug to callmeliam, alexh0w and several speedfriends that i know are there.I send a lot of luck to Ecdycis, who's a tremendous speedrunner and commentator who will surprise us with the game!
My 6 year old neighbor recently had to have his leg amputated due to cancer. I have a son that same age. And as a dad, you never want your kid to experience that. To all those impacted by cancer, stay strong and know that you are loved. Sending good vibes to all of you.Thanks to everyone at GDQ - the runners, staff, organizers, and even the dancers on the front row and viewers watching. Donation goes to Raelcun's choice.
So sorry I had to miss Pete's run of Doctor Hauser, but want to throw support his way and toward kicking cancer in the throat! Pete is a great dude, glad he is involved in this community and comes out to.help in this endeavor when he can.
4fps is just about enough for my 56k connection. It's great to see these lesser-known platforms getting representation, and another wonderful Awful Games block. Putting this towards the best Final Fantasy, coincidentally the sixth.
Hey y'all, donating at the tail end of Awful Games Done Quick to celebrate everyone's favorite flying squirrel and moose. Donation goes to Final Fantasy VI, because more speedruns means more donations and cool tricks!
Keep horror block weird <3
Hewwo!Ecdycis, thanks for bringing the fascinating experience that is NightCry to AGDQ! Watch out for those vending machines, bro.(donations to runner's choice)
Hi Eck, it's thk. Congrats on finally getting onto the big stage of AGDQ. I don't understand why they put NightCry into the awful block though. Leonard himself makes this game AMAZING, and if you disagree, you need to be converted to the church of Leonard. By the way, if you get within 1 minute of your PB during this run, I'll throw in another $5 later. $10 instead if you World Record. Good luck and remember to keep an eye out in the end game. ;) Also go ahead and put this money towards Eck's choice.
FF6 is my all-time favorite RPG, looking forward to see it slaugthered! :D
Big Tomato here, ready to give you all the antioxidants you need to prevent cancer along with these 25 dollars. FF6 NG+? Do tell!
Had to donate for my man Ecdycis and the best "sequel" to Clock Tower. Thank you so much for keeping it alive. Good luck on the run!Donation goes to Ecdycis' choice.
Good luck on the run ecdycis, also nightcry is a amazing game. donation goes to runners choice
Remember to stay hydrated!
I've been looking forward to the NightCry run ever since the schedule was released so I HAD to donate during it. Is it just me or does that bucket look awfully familiar? Donation goes towards runner's choice.
First time donating but this has been great entertainment and all for a great cause, keep on playing.
Thank you runners for supporting PCF. Can we get a "woop woop" from the audience. I can't wait for the Super Mario Blind races! Incentive goes to runners choice.
Thank you guys so much for doing this awesome work! I lost a very close family member to cancer and every little bit helps to fight it!
For Ecdycis who is a lovely, kind, caring and amazing human. I'm so proud of you for getting this terrible game into AGDQ! much love from your community.
Hey Ecdycis, woke up early not only to work but to also watch your run live at GDQ. Glad to see your dream of having a man chasing with giant scissor on stage; but you're not done yet. Keep on chasing those dreams. From your weird mod Sora <3
I never heard of that Game but thought no better time to donated than on my birth day.
A comfortable looking sofa
Props to Monica's running animation. She's doing way better than I would be, wearing that dress...
Hey Eck! Glad to see you running NightCry at a GDQ. The people needed to see this one. I wish you luck on the run and let's get that 800K!!!
Ecdycis is one of my favorite runners and the reason I started to get into speedrunning. It's great to see him run Nightcry live and remember, for the alliance!
Petit don et grand merci à vous pour ce Awful Block, cette AGDQ et nos commentateurs et commentatrices #zhtDoom
Hey Ecdycis! Glad to see that you've managed to beat your PB for keeping your face uninjured at a GDQ! Oh, and your first appearance on the big stage and all that. Best of luck, and hopefully there's a White Castle you can go to after this is over.
Greatly appreciating the hyper-realism of this game, developed by people who have apparently never seen a woman walk in heels or actual hair.
Watching Nightcry and I'm super happy that awful games block is still going on!
So happy to watch the best Silent Hill during the best AGDQ block!Merci beaucoup ;-)
I said if chat acknowledged me I would donate $5 and that I was gonna donate either way. Several people said Hi so... here's $5. Incentive to Announcers choice.
Had to donate during Nightcry, a game I've never heard of. My friend and I were obsessed with Clock Tower as kids, to the point that I went as Scissorman for Halloween. Let's cut cancer rates down to 0!
Have always enjoyed watching the GDQ runs but haven't been able to catch any of them live due to work and school. Put this money towards the Golden Deer House for Fire Emblem because Claude von Riegan has a dream, and it's to see a Fodlan united against cancer
Watching nightcry is a great cozy way to start the morning! Also ecdycis, is this world record?
Absolutely loving the morning horror block, you're making my workday so much better.Thanks to everyone who makes this great event possible.Hi Redic
I'm supposed to be working but the horror of the last two games has kept my eyes glued to the screen. Here's a dollar for every frame of Doctor Hauser and 2 for every scene that makes sense in Nightcry
Here's for the crew who works with AGDQ! Thanks to you we hopefully can say sayonara to cancer sooner than later. Donation goes towards readers choice.
Congrats Eck on getting your first game to GDQ. Let's defeat cancer with the awesome power of Leonard.
I've been looking forward to this Nightcry run all week! Shoutout from the front row.
Awesome run! Can't wait for you do to Silent Hill: Homecoming on pc one of these days!
I've been home sick with the flu since Tuesday and have been watching AGDQ pretty much non-stop. Thanks for keeping me entertained!
Donating in memory of Michael "Macstorm" Cunningham, former RPGamer editor in chief and supporter of Team Handheld, who cancer took from us far too soon in 2018.Putting the donation toward the Black Eagles for Fire Emblem: Three Houses, because we'll crush cancer the same way Edelgard crushes the Church of Seiros.
Good luck Ecdycis!! <3
Hey Ec, awesome to see you at GDQ and glad I got to catch your run live! Great commentary as always!
2016 BY THE WAY
With the blessing of Leonard, the masses can now be a witness to this coming of a video game God! Congratulations Ec, so happy to see you on the big stage once more.PS: Astolfo says hi too!
Leonard is so powerful they had to distract him in order to defeat him as a direct assault would have ended in misery. I'm so happy to see you doing this run on AGDQ Ecdycis! I'm rooting for ya boss!
Kickstarted it, got the signed edition which they gave a download code so you didn't have to open it. The "artbook" was a booklet in the case. Also, the monsters were designed by masahiro ito (from silent hill fame.)
Have to donate for the absolute Chad of a man that is Leonard.
I'm on a boat.
Love AGDQ! Thank you to everyone involved for making it such an amazing event. Let's end cancer.
800k hypeeeThis awful game looks awfully awful.
Quick donation because I'd love to see GDQ hit $800,000 during Nightcry. Shoutout to everyone who joined the Project Scissors: NightCry Kickstarter! I'm sure we're all feeling very proud right now.
People keep donating for "Runner's Choice", but it never actually wins. Donation to name the Pokemon X/Y main character "RunnrsChoice"
Long time watcher (since the very first) and finally am able to donate! World needs a little care in it and love what you all do. Keep up the good work and keep it fast!
RIP Leonard. :(
Thank you for showing the world what godly powers Leonard has, and the best literally shipped power couple.
I didn't realize you were doing a run this AGDQ Ecdycis! Came upon your stream a few months ago when your brother raided you. I couldn't not support you during this run for this great cause!
Let's hit 800k during this weird trash game, lets go
GDQ Forever!
This nightcry run is too funny, had to donate again!
$800,000 hype!
BAH GAWD! Rooney's lost her mind, stop the dang match!
Love to Watch GDQ. Always a Great Event. HYPE!
Didn’t realize there was another bonus game for the awful block-because this run is JUST AWFUL. Thanks for making me laugh the past hour Ecdycis!
#Goupix
One of my favorite things about GDQ events is seeing a run for a game that I've never even heard of and experiencing one of the most engaging runs of the event. Such is the case for Nightcry! Great run and commentary!
X/Y main character name "Runner's Choice". Now that's something I can get behind!
You heard it here folks, Nightcry is like Die Hard!
Here's $50 for the Final Fantasy VI run. I love this game!

Love the awful block and horror block so far! Let’s beat cancer together!
Hello, AGDQ! Long-time watcher, second time donating!This is in honor of not only my grandmother, who lost her fight with cancer last year, but in honor of two friends whose mother also lost the fight just before Christmas.Those two friends introduced me to the Fatal Frame series, and I've been looking forward to this speedrun thanks to them! Shoutout to them, and good luck with the run, Maxy!
Hey Maxy light them ghosts up and crowd let's hear some cheers.Greetings from Germany
I am beyond excited to finally see my favorite horror series on AGDQ! Been looking to start running the 2nd game with a friend. Thanks for running it!
Love watching Fatal Frame because I'm too a-scared to play it myself! Good luck on the run, donation goes to runner's choice!
I live with a hereditary precancerous disease so seeing anyone come together to help both patients and research on anything related to this matter makes me happy... Be loving this horror block and just wanted to say let's get to 900k. Gamers always come together for the good causes! HYPEE
Hi Maxy. I heard this game was based on a true story. That means ghost catching cameras exist right?Shout outs to all my spooky game runners

Great to See Aneternal & Nub on the couch, much love guys.
So happy to see Fatal Frame being runned at a GDQ, especially by Maxylobes ! I love this serie so much and I'm really curious to see the speedrun. Good luck with the run Maxy ! Love from France
Hello there! So glad to see you well. This is my first time donating to such an incredible event. I'm so glad Maxy got to run fatal frame this year. Hey Maxy, do you think we'll ever get a Fatal Frame remake? Let's go Blues!!!
Finally seeing a Fatal Frame run at GDQ! Go Maxy! Love the series, but I'm the biggest scaridy cat on this planet, so I poop my pans anytime. Will donate another 10$ if Maxy lands a Fatal Frame on a ghost.
So, where does this place in the Luigi's Mansion canon? Love the run, keep up with the good work!
So hyped to see Fatal Frame run. This is by far one of my favorite horror games. Say hi to Tatamu-chan ghost for me!
Gotta get those Fatal Frame Perfect shots! Good luck on the run!
Fatal Frame is my favorite series ever! I hear vacations at the Himuro Mansion are lovely, I brought back an entire album of memories. Good luck to the runner!
I didn't realize pokemon snap was on the schedule. Is this the ghost type% run?
I lost my mom in early July to lung cancer and my father is still battling the same thing. The horror speedrunning community has been a source of immense help and support during this difficult time and I just knew I had to donate during the horror block both in support of cancer prevention and in gratitude for the countless nights of support and distraction I've received. I love you all, even if I mostly just lurk. Good luck on the runs everyone.
I first played Fatal Frame with my father when I was in Highschool. It quickly became my favorite, and all of my friends have been innuendated with it. I'm glad to see it at a GDQ. Also, The Latern is lit. Dontaiton to runner's choice.
Had to show my support for Maxy and this organization. Since I can't watch him stream I have to get my fix somehow. Donation to Maxy's choice.
Shoutout to Maxy and the couch! Good luck on your run and Horror Block HYPE
Fatal hype. So glad I get to see it Live and in person. GOOD LUCK MAXY YOUR THE BEST. MAXYPARTY donation to runners choice

 (Comment rejected)
It's been a week full of truly amazing runs. Happy to donate to such a worthwhile cause, and thanks to all the runners and organizers!
Mafuyuu~!
My favorite band actually wrote a song about this game. It goes like: "Look at this photograph. Every time I do it makes me laugh."
Fatal frame at AGDQ? Oh "snap"! Good luck on the run, give it your best "shot" and I hope nothing breaks your "focus"!
Gotta show love to both Maxy and Enigma! You two have been a big staple in my life for years now and wanted to donate when the two of you were together on the stream! One love! Kick this runs butt, Maxy. And Enigma, just stay glorious.
~Busting makes me FILM GOOD!~
Thanks for playing one of the best experiences I've had on ps2, Project Zero! :D
Putting this money toward the legit Riven fight in Destiny 2, because I've never seen it done legitimately in a speedrun or anywhere else.
Based on a true story
It's raining again... I'm so glad my first donation gets to be during Fatal Frame! Keep on keeping on!
Well Well Well, if it isn´t Childy
Phillipe is level 5 and that's special
The Devil May Cry series has amazing cutscenes, and Faust might actually top DMC4's Lucifer for best weapon intro. Take my money to help get this glorious moment in DMC history at GDQ.
If only sleep wasn't needed, we would be able to watch all of these runs. I myself need to check out for a shift. GL in Fatal Frame and the runs coming up in the next 8 hours.
My favorite boys on my maxys couch and maxy playing my favorite series <3 Love you all
Had to donate during the first game in my favorite game series of all time, Fatal Frame.
If someone dies after being accused of a crime they didn't commit, would they be Fatally Framed?!....Anyways, sorry for that...donation goes to runner's choice.
Donating in memory of my grandmother. It's been almost 5 years since losing her to cancer and we miss her every day. Good luck with the run. Here's $10 to name Lucario "3000Years" in Pokemon X/Y!
If the runner was a baker would he be called Maxy Loaves?
Are we doing puns now? Aperture is worth a thousand words.
Smile! You're on Can-Dead Camera!
Sneaking this in while at work but I have to donate when my boi Maxy is playing.
Here comes a special boy!
So happy to see Fatal Frame this year at AGDQ! I remember late nights in the college dorm playing this with all of my friends and being terrified
Why are some people so *negative* about puns in donation messages? They're over in a *flash*, so you won't have much *exposure* to them.
my eyes! My eyes! MY EYES!! can't get enough of this Fatal Frame run
Please tell me GTA 6 is coming out this year.
AGDQ keeps me entertained during boring night shifts at the hospital, thanks!
Ghosts are so light. They barely weigh an instrgram.This ghost fact based on a true story.
Now I understand why we have to save the animals, because clearly the frames are fatal. True story.
Can we talk about the announcer's fantastic Nickelback impression
Fatal Frame has always been my favorite series. Ever since the first one based on a true story, I've been ROPED in. When I see how fast you're going, I can't believe MY EYES. Can't wait to see how this run DEVELOPS. Keep on going, and no matter what happens, don't lose SPIRIT. This story was based on a true donation.
Some of these comments are snappy, but others are so un-focused they make me shutter.
I love these kind of games where player can snap his head back to give evil eye to the couch
All these bad picture jokes are fatal. FYI don't blame the announcer, he's been framed.
Donating for all the good good photography puns.
Hey Maxy! Love seeing some of my favorite people attending GDQ on the camera. I hope GDQ's camera doesn't take your souls! Donation goes to that DMC 5 Devil Hunter upgrade! Enigma7's to everyone on the couches!
Maxy make sure you don't snap under the pressure and stay focus on the path. I will be making sure you don't blur from the main objective.
No, we hired you you to shoot the ghosts, with a gun not a camera! Ugh, whatever, she'll never- oh she's back! I guess it works out? Donating for DMC5 Faust cutscene
Do a 360 Auto-Focus!
Oh man i love to sit back, relax and watch some of those abandoned house exploration videos
les 800k c'est fait, un petit coup de pouce pour la suite. #Tempetedesang
Is this the only game where you actually get to *shoot* ghosts?
So glad to see Fatal Frame getting plenty of... exposure at GDQ! Thanks for the run, maxylobes.
Congrats on ten years of helping great causes, GDQ! Keep up the good work!Might not have a chance to donate later, so gotta ensure Three Houses's best boy, Claude, has a shot at bringing his dream into frame.Good luck to all the runners, as well as the staff who put out all those fires behind the scenes before we even see them!
Looking forwarding to the Fire Emblem GOLDEN DEER run happening later today, and enjoying the picture perfect run happening now - I couldn't ghost y'all if I wanted too!
Hey, do you think ghost LEGOs explain what's up with NightCry's walk cycles?Super excited to see my favorite horror series finally debut at AGDQ!
Question for Maxy and the couch, do the film type numbers have any significance?
Greetings from Saudi Arabia.
I am so glad to catch the stream live again this year. So proud of the community for all they have accomplished in ten years. Such fantastic runs and even greater contributions to important charities. AlwaysGiveDonationsQuickly!
Had to donate during Maxy's run. One of the most entertaining runners I've ever watched. Thanks to everyone who makes this event possible. Keep up the good work everyone!
(To the tune of photograph by nickel back)Every memory of lookin out the back door,I found a photo of a ghost I was lookin for,It’s hard to say it, Time to say it, MY EYES!MYYYY EYYYYYYYES!(Extra 50 dollars of the commenterSings)
I love this game but I'm terrible at it - watching someone do it well and quickly is mindblowing.I definitely have used Miku's heelies before but never strategically. Wow.
This Dead Rising sequel sure is boring. I'm still waiting for this girl to chug 4 gallons of orange juice on a skateboard.
Maxy great to see you running AGDQ. Cameras are tricky, first they frame you, then they shoot you, then they hang you on the wall! Stay cool my guy!
Pictures of you, pictures of meHung upon your wall for the world to seePictures of you, pictures of meRemind us all of what we used to be
Great to see you here again Maxylobes. I'd say you and this game really CLICK. You cover such a WIDE-ANGLE of information about the game. It's neat to watch you KODAK-a daka daka daka all these ghosts with your camera. I'm excited to see how the story DEVELOPS. Keep doing awesome and don't lose FOCUS. You're on a ROLL! ...of film
This is a frame perfect run!
sup maxy
Did you hear about the photographer who went mad trying to take a close-up picture of the horizon?Yeah, true story.
I could never picture myself playing this game. But I came-ra for the puns.
Maxy you did it! Fatal Frame is GDQ official! All of chat is here cheering you on. Go fast and save those frames, hope they're not fatal.
So glad to finally see a Fatal Frame run, have fun Maxy and folks! MY EYESsss
I have no puns, I'm sorry. I wouldn't be able to outshine anyone else's, anyway. But good luck Maxy...Loaves? :)
What happens if you sit on ice for too long? You get polar-roids!
a cute amount of money
This is a really interesting Metroid: Other M mod. Just goes to show SOMETHING good came of the game I guess
This is the true story of several ghosts picked to live in Luigi's Mansion and have their lives fatally framed. Find out what happens…when ghosts stop being polite…and start getting real...Luigi's Mansion
I'm really enjoying how all these bad puns have led to a sense of cameraderie on the couch
Boy, this speed run is flying by! It's sure to be a photo finish!
Boooooooooooooooooo to these puns.Get it? Like a ghost.
FLASH! - AHAAAAAAA!
This ghosting is way worse than my dating experience on Tinder.
I can see you're pulling out all the F-STOPS for this run. I'll try to avoid OVEREXPOSING my love for puns, but I had to placate my FLARE for the dramatic. Let me DODGE out of here before I overstay my welcome. Good luck with the run!
why must we do the angy thing, the only reason why is that i started to brake down and cry with the combination of the wheelies and her saying she is angy no talk as she wheelies away
Love this game! Love Maxylobes! I have zero puns, but thanks for making my afternoon fun.
Why does the girl have a bald spot? Love the work
A stone mask? Is that a JoJo’s reference???
Hello AGDQ, greetings from Germany. I love this game so much. #childhood
how do you emulate a camera? you get the ISO
Why can't you find good photography jokes? They haven't been developed yet.Good luck on the run!
That ghost is quite an eye sore.
Puns in donation comments? It just GHOSTS to show that...uh...F-Stop...never mind.
You're zooming through this game so fast that these ghosts are going by with a flash, so much for their gdq exposure
These comments are all oversaturated with puns. Can't you all stay in the background for once?
You can die and become undead or become undead and then die, but if you hate puns you never truly lived.
Was maxy looking for myyyyyyy eyesssss, can you sew them shut (you have to say it like the alice in chains song)
I'm so excited to see a Fatal Frame run! Fatal Frame is one of my favorite series, and this run has been fantastic so far. Keep up the great work! <3

(Announcer: to the melody of "Behind Blue Eyes" by The Who)No one knows what it's like to be the sad mask.To be the happy maskBehind MY EYES
Unbelievable. Even in death, people just won't sit still for a photo
Miku After running all night "My thighs!"When the bakery is sold out of her favorite bread " My ryes!" When she forgets about the oven "My pies!"when they wont let her on a roller coaster "My size!"When she loses a carnival game "My prize!"
This is an interesting Majora's Mask rom hack. Really makes the pictobox the focus of the game. Good luck on night three.
Hey Maxy it is Boco! Sorry for being MIA for so long from stream. A lot of personal and work stuff. Also got to make my MAGFest DJ debut this year. But so happy to see you running such a great horror game this GDQ. Justvpopping in to let you know you are still my fave horror streamer and i always enjoy your stuff. As well as Marbles!
Good luck finding your bro, dude.

Moat if these ghosts aren’t very.. PHOTOGENIC!!? …got ‘em..!
Make sure to *DODGE* those ghosts and don't get *BURNED* by their attacks! (*Note* dodging and burning are photography techniques to lighten or darken developing photos)
Wasn’t quite sure how to frame this comment, but at least this format lens itself well to doing so. This game is a great snapshot of the horror genre, I look forward to seeing how it further develops. This comment is based on a true story.
Blue Lions For Life
Someone who knows legends about cutlery is a Fork-lorist
Imagine if you stubbed your toe while looking the camera?? I would yell “F - Stop! I need to re focus on this fight!”
Are there any frame perfect skips in this game?
First time donator here. Had to support such a great cause and give it up for Maxy for his continued great work. Good luck on the run
I'm not saying these photography puns smell, but they sure are a pile of focal matter.
GDQ has spared me of the boredom of exam period throughout my college years. Now at last I can afford to donate, so here it goes! Keep up the good work, this event is seriously amazing <3
Watch out for goosests, aka, goose ghosts. Hoo00oonnkk
Great to see Team Silent at GDQ again. Horror streamers make a wonderful and welcoming community of streamers and viewers that I'm happy to be in, even as a lurker. I'm glad to see them all get this kind of "exposure." It's difficult to "frame" into words. I "shutter" to think of what other puns folks can "develop."
Hey guys! I'm really enjoying this Pokemon Snap run! But could someone please explain why you're only encountering ghost-types?
Always love seeing a fatal frame run, this goes out to all y'all and I'll throw in an extra 20 if I can get the cutests Mafuyu.
I'm confused, the game is about the one and only CAMERA defeating monsters? So where's the giant flying turtle?Props to you if you get the pun.
Use that fancy ghost camera to get me some pictures of Spider-Man! In Ultimate Difficulty!
Not the BEES. MY EYES.
What people lived in the southern parts of Mexico? MAYANSI don't understand why people have such a hard time with these camera puns, they're Canon.
Shout out to Maxy, Enigma, Ecdysis and Nubb. This has to be the hairiest couch and runner combo this week. True story.
If you don't survive the bad puns made during Fatal Frame, have you given up the ghost?
Did you know that if you link your Amazon prime to your twitch account, you get one free sub that you could use to subscribe to gamesdonequick?
I wore the Blinding Mask to a bar once. I was very impressed with the drinks, I was particularly fond of their MAI TAIS!
This game is going by in a flash! I wonder if it’ll be a world record? I’m sure it’ll be a photo finish.
Toss a coin to your GDQO' Valley o' Plenty
y'all gotta f-stop with all the camera jokes
Always excited to see horror games on GDQ. This block goes by in a flash! Donation goes to the "Faust Cutscene" because how can we NOT see those dance moves
Wanna know why this game had great exposure? It's because the development always happens in dark rooms!
I'm always happy to see Maxylobes play my favorite version of Pokemon Snap! First time donating for AGDQ but certainly not the last. Let's kick ghost butts, let's kick cancer's butt!
So much great interaction between the runner, couch, announcer and audience but I feel like Chat is a little left out....So, cant I get a SNAP, CHAT?
I don’t understand, where are the Snapchat face filters on this camera?
GG encore le French Restream, gros (beau) boulot. Bourrez les dons pour André !
I like to take pictures of crocodiles on my downtime, I'm quite the snapper I gotta say. Delighted I could catch the run, good luck Mr. Lobes!
as my mother and aunt being survivors im for it keep it up
Loving this run of Zelda: Minolta's Mask.
We need to put an F-stop to these puns
Why don't you catch up to the ghost, because they're gone in a flash! True story!
<insert camera pun here>And thank you for raising money. Two of my grandparents were taken by cancer. It's a loss I hope someday no one has to share. Keep on runnin' and stay focused on the goal.
Shame this wasn't a race I was really hoping for a photo finish. Anyways, shout out to buying more Phantoms for the Prevent Cancer Foundation to help heal the world, you're all doing incredible work with much love from Scotland.
When this run is over I’m gonna shake it -shake-shake-shake it like a Polaroid picture in celebration!
DMC IS BACK!
This game is so dark I have a feeling there should be a black room.
I don't know how many runners run Fatal Frame, but there seems to be quite the Depth of FieldI have more photo puns, but for now I'll just f-stop.
So, the Camera Obscura transports and captures ghosts? It must have been developed by Aperture Science.
Hey GDQ, what should you do if you're trapped in a haunted house with a camera? Look for the EXIF!
Pleasure to see you zoom through this game.
To those booing in the crowd please, stop being so 'negative.' These puns are setting the 'landscape' for a great run. While its true I'm sure you're all 'developing' a hatred for these puns you gotta admit, they're a lot of fun. 'Lens' all give MaxyLobes our support and here's to a great GDQ. Pet the ghost.
I was just wondering how much dodging Maxy needs to manipulate the film routes? Great run for a great cause! Also this was a stealth pun.
Not sure I’m following the game’s story, but it has a cool framing device. Loving the run, though— always nice to see early PS2 games, they’re such a neat snapshot of history.
I've been waiting so long for maxylobes run, I think I have Poloroids.
I think this girl took it too literally when her teacher told her to "develop her photos in a darkroom"
Loving AGDQ so far, cant wait to see how this speedrun develops but its so scary its making me shutter.
End of last year, during my trial exams, my Aunt died of breast cancer. It was terrible seeing how my cousins had to struggle to keep themselves alive since she was their only source of income. My mother has had breast cancer about five times and my grandmother died of cancer a few years ago. Overall, I have had a long road with cancer even though it never affected me directly. Here's to hoping my few bucks can help save some other people my family's pain.
We're zooming through Awesome Frames Done Quick and we're now experiencing a ghastly amount of puns.
I'll save you, me and chat from anymore bad puns and just say; I'm stoked to see Fatal Frame at GDQ. It's one of my favorite horror games. Good luck with the run Maxy!
I guess you can say that ghosts aren't photogenic. No pun here.
The ghost priest was rude for luring you in? Nonsense he was just bringing you into focus.
i really wanted to donate for a long time, i lost my grandfather to cancer so now that i can, here is my first donation!.keep up the good work and kick cancer in the chin!
Try not to lose your head dealing with all these priests, maxyI tried to think of a photography pun but I just don't have the spirit for it.
Heard this game was Based on a true story, if you frame it right I can PICTURE a horrible story. I SHUTTER thinking of those poor DEVELOPers making this game. Hope the ghost enjoy thier New Dead+
F-Stop. Horror time!
Boy this new Pokémon Snap game has some stupid Pokémon in it...
shashin o totte ii desu ka
No puns here everyone, but I have a joke for you!Where did the ghost go on vacation?Mali-boo! Thank you for speed running one of my favourite games!
Wanted to wait until dark souls but project zero also has a special place in my heart. Greetings from Austria and let's get the FF VI incentive done
Way to go Maxy, and remember to CROP it like its hot!
It's cool to see a game centered on modern issues like the difficulties of having an Instagram ghoul-friend.Keep up the great work for a great cause, hello from Germany, ORB HONK HYPE etc etc.
It turns out, the real true story were the memories we made along the way. This comment was based on a fictional story.
No continues? So if you die in fatal frame... you die at GDQ?
This Fatal Frame run has been great so far. I'm excited to see how the end "develops". I "shudder" to think that it'll be over in a....flash.
These are bad puns. Boo.. boo... BOOO!!!!
Fatal Frame: A true story on why you never give toddlers access to your Lego collection
I know Maxylobes is too good to wind up dead, but if it happened, would we call for F-stops in the chat?
Third night? I doubt remember freddy being in fatal frame.
We were successfully cast for the upcoming Fantastic Four remake, all thanks to your headshots, Maxylobes.
Insert camera pun here
I'd come up with a pun too, but I don't want my donation to be too flashy....oh wait.
F-Stop it with these puns!
Fourth Night? I hear it's a scary Battle Royale.
She is slow going down a ladder because she doesn't want to... FLASH anyone
Honk!Towards Spyro pearler please
This donation is based on true money.
So if this game had an explosive to take out the ghosts, would it be a... Photobomb?
Do you think all these ghosts are just MASKING their feelings? Here's your SHOT to really show them the BIG PICTURE.AGDQ HONK
What do you call a device made up of parts from several different photo taking devices? A ca-mera (Chimera).
All these puns are TEARable at least were recycling
So is it... Canon... that this was based on a true story?
All these donations... a real Pun-o-rama
Hi Max you smell. Also bittieHug. <3
Honestly Maliboo doesn't seem that appealing. If I were a ghost I'd much rather visit Shutter Island
Hey everyone just wanted to wish Maxy a great run ! Glad I got to see this!
What do you think Miku's alcohol of choice is? Do you think she's a fan of spirits?
Honk!!Towards Spyro pearler please
Based on a true HONK
Pun filled donation comment.
Thank you for playing one of my all-time favorite games. No matter how much time has passed it still looks boo-tiful to me. As always, runners choice!
What is a horror game runner's favorite strat? Damage BOOsts.
you really have to have a developed sense of humor to get these quickshot puns, are the ghosts just shy or maybe they hate being flashed! I wonder if the family master ghost really killed everyone or if he was just framed?Goodluck Maxylobes, Im sure this speedrun was based on a true story!
Super Mario maker 2I love the Kazio Mario community.You guys are the best. Maybthe best team win. YATTA! Marbles, marbles, marbles...
I think the real cancer we should be donating to prevent are all these puns being read, jokes aside it's all for a good cause. Cancer takes too many people too early and I'm grateful so many people can come together donate for such a great cause.
Honk!!!Towards Spyro pearler please
What do you call it when the runner pays for your semester? MaxyLoans. Based on a boo story
Hey guys! This is my second year watching. Love the show and I'm excited to see you playing one of my favorite scary games being played. Fatal Frame still scares me to this day.But as a photographer, I just wanted to say these camera puns need to F-Stop.
Thanks for the awesome event, everyone! Also looking forward to another decade of GDQ.
So much positivity from the horror runners! Great event!
Thanks for the great work.
 (Comment rejected)
I am a big Fan of Speedrunning and Resident Evil, I hope we can beat Cancer every day a little faster, like the Games in this AGDQ!
Even I'm not a fan of cancer. I hate it so much that I want you all to donate. If you don't I'll hunt you down and gut you like a fish. (Quote from 2000 movie)

Hi everyone! I got some money saved up and I'm puttin' it on the GDQ pile!
Time for more Final Fantasy! Let’s get the Hype Train rolling!
Greetings from Finland! Been watching Games Done Quick since 2011 and so proud of you guys and what you're doing. Lost both my parents to cancer. Resident Evil 4 is one of my favourite games of all time, and what I'd like to say isAshley, go hide!Mikewave, go fast!
Leon! Help!
Best of luck to all Runners!
Who better to Resident Evil 4 speed run than mikewave, the person who made the most comprehensive and detailed Resident Evil 4 speed run guide I have ever seen. It is also 12 hours long. Good luck on the the run, don't get meme'd, and pray for a good Novi's.
Tra-La-Laa!
The RE4 community is with you today and wishes you good luck, Mike! Thank you for representing the game this year.
Hey MaN! I'm glad to see RE4 back in GDQ and being done by a talented runner as yourself. I hope you pull off an amazing run, MikeGL
Dear AGDQ,I am a speed runner just like you.I like to watch speed runs, and you are my favorite speed runners. When I grow up, I want to be just like you, and I think I'm on the right route.Get it? Route, because speed runners run on routes, and you are speed runneers, and I am a speed runner.Do you get it? Do you get my joke about the route?My question for you is:I am a good kid, and I like to swag strat, and I like to go to AGDQ, but sometimes I reset. What do you do when you have to reset?How do you not reset?Sincerely,BoJack
Hi Waifu!
We got a refund on a cross country train ticket so were throwing it at a good cause and great runs!
Premier don en remerciant toute l'équipe du LFR et n'oubliez pas...Bourrez les dons et gardez la pêche !
HONK to prevent cancer! HONK TWICE to thank GDQ staff! HONK THRICE to have honked three times
What’re you buyin’? Cancer prevention and detection research! It won’t help with the Plagas, though.
This will always be my favorite Resident Evil game. “Help me Leon!”
Hey Mike, Metal Socks here, and all I can say is LEEOOONNN! good luck!!
Greetings from the front row! I still remember when 1:34 was the world record for new game plus. It’s great to see RE4 at GDQ again. BlessRNG, comrade. (Do the thing)
My favorite thing about RE4 is the salesman fitting rocket launchers and a whole Walmart full of ammo under their trench-coat. WHAT ARE YA BUYIN’.
Resident Evil 4 was my favorite resident evil game, thanks to my bro David for introducing me to this awesome series. Thanks to all the runners and organizers for making these events so memorable. Also Honk!
Hehehe, Thank you!
Stoked to see one of my favorite games in the Resident Evil series be torn apart. Here's to an exciting run and an even more exciting rest of AGDQ! One last thing, MIKEWAVE, "What are ya buying?!"

¡Un forastero!
Thanks for running one of my favorite games Mikewave. Big thanks to everybody in front and behind the controllers for making AGDQ so awesome. ♥
Had to donate during one of the best games ever made. Shout out to my husband, sitting in the front row, who abandoned me for an entire week to hang out with his friends at AGDQ. All is forgiven though as he's decked out in his incredible Leon S Kennedy cosplay. Lookin' good, hot stuff! =)
Wanted to donate during my favorite Resident Evil! Unfortunately no one is running 6 this year, so I guess 4 will have to do.Best of luck to the runners and thanks to all of the staff!
I see London, I see France, I see Spidey's underpants.
I have never seen Leon S. Kennedy at this speed. It's truly frightening. Leon cannot be stopped!?
So Mendez is the Mayor of this village, right? Won't >you< become the mayor after you defeated him? This is how it works, right? :thinking_smiley:
MIIIIIIIIKEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE. I'm taking a few minutes to sneak away from work to wish my boy MIKE__WAVE a good luck!
I wanted to be great warrior and hero, but then i took a rocket to my knee.
Good luck, Mike! It's always great to see this game run at GDQs. You've got all the RE4 boys watching and cheering you on. By the way, there's another $100 coming if you get through all 3 novi areas without a death.Also, hey to Maxy and Waifu on the couch. You guys are a great crew to give some great commentary.
I was a monster once, but then I took a rocket to the knee.
JTB's Resident Evil 4 run from SGDQ 2015 was what made me fall in love with GDQ and speedrunning. That moment they all pull out American flag sunglasses and reveal their American Flag t-shirts. "LIKE YOU, I'M AMERICAN!". That was the moment I knew.
Sup Mike! So awesome to see you running in a GDQ! Been looking forward to this run all event, so good luck on the run! Donation goes to runner choice mikewaYAYA
Go Raccoon City PD!
Hey Ant! This is your time, my friend. The community of The Last Of Us is with you now. Enjoy every moment - you deserve it for the years of work you've put into this game.
LEON!!!!!
Way to go runners. Really enjoying watching this RE4 run from Minneapolis!
Petit oublie :#zhtDoom
Greetings from Germany,I always love to get me some Resident Evil speed running in the evening and I'm already hyped for the Remake of Resident Evil 3.Also shout outs to my peer Dominik. Thanks again for gifting me a part of your PS3 game collection. Because of that I had some money for charity lying around.
Had to donate during my favorite block. I look forward to horror game block every GDQ! Thank you to everyone who puts this event together!!
Had to donate to one of my favorite games, Leon's one liners were always so bad, but in a good way. Good luck on the run.
Leon: *does anything and everything*Ashley: *paniced* LEON!!!
I had to donate again during my absolute favorite game ever being ran and commentated by some of my favorite people. This game terrified me as a kid, but was so much fun. Shoutout to the gamecube for getting such a good exclusive. Also shoutout to the president for only sending 1 man with 1 handgun to a different country to rescue his kidnapped daughter.
Hey Mike, Good luck with the run. We're fortunate to have such a great representative of the community on stage today. Make sure to make a Real Police Dude joke, JTB will love it
Leon! Help me! There's an infected goose!HONK
Ashley just needs somebody to Leon
Fun fact: Ashley's voice actress, Carolyn Lawrence, also voices Sandy Cheeks.
Runners Choice Incentive.
My right hand comes off, and when it does you better watch out
Great Resident Evil 4 run! I always wanted to play it but then i took a rocket to my knee . #JustLEEEEOOONthings.
What're you selling? Cause I've got ten bucks here burning a hole in my wallet😉Keep up the good work, all the best from the EU.
Never got into the Resident Evil games, but my wife loves them so this donation is for her! <3
Crash hates cancer!!!

We need pictures of Spiderman! Wait, why is he only wearing underpants? I can't publish that!
As always shoutouts to the 502 Krew, the Ocarina of Time community, and for another amazing GDQ!
Me llamo Ramon Salazar
Had to donate during one of my all time favorite games. It's awesome to see a run without new game + weapons thats beeing finished faster than I can complete the game with all those weapons. Good luck to Mikewave and greetings to all the people present at AGDQ.
1-2-3-4? That's amazing, I have the same combination on my luggage!
Whoa, FF6 as a bonus game? Let's do it!Great job to all the runners, keep up the good work!
Happy Birthday, Dean!
Such fast! Very speed! Wow! Best of luck to all runners. All our base are belong to you.
Roses are red, violeta are blue, I can't rhyme, just honk on cue
I'm always happy to see AGDQ live when I load my twitch page. Keep fighting the good fight!
Quick, catch me up on the other 3 Resident Evil games.
Leeeeeon! Help us to fight cancer!
Donating during a game I was always too scared to play myself but I loved watching my brother play. Let’s get FFVI bonus game unlocked! $5 donation train?
Hey guys Trichael Man here, long time viewer, first time donator. Wishing good luck to my homie MIKE__WAVE on the RE4 run and shout outs to Waifu and MaxyLobes on the couch! I met so many great friends in the RE4 speedrunning community, they are always down we always welcome new runners! You guys are all awesome and this is to the right against cancer.
YOU'RE SMALL TIME, SALAD BAR
I thought Resident Evil 4 runs like this were a cliche that only happens in your Hollywood movies. Oh Mr. Mikewave, you entertain me.
"If it involves pushing statue onto the pressure plate, it's RE puzzle" Legend of Zelda in the background was like "am I a joke to you?". Good luck with the rest of the run tho.
Woah, thank you earlier donator for letting me know about the donation incentive for the bonus game of FF VI!We're roughly at 6% completed. Let's GOOOOO!
Not gonna be able to catch the Destiny 2 raid live so I’m donating now instead during this incredible Resi 4 run.My additional challenge request to you folks in Orlando is to see who can do the best “what’re you buyin’?” shopkeeper impression.
AGDQ, a few years ago my grandmother passed away of cancer, I can't stop thinking that if we had detected it before she would still be here with us, that's why I admire what you do, I hope you continue like this for many years, good luck to the runners, sorry my horrible english, saludos desde Mexico
Hello ! Comment vous proposer des lots pour l'an prochain ?
It's been a long week. Let's kill cancer.
4 is the first resident evil game I played, and it warms my heart to see it so broken. Thanks mikewave for doing this run!
Thanks for the great run! Resident Evil 4 was one of my favorite games in high school. I'm so happy to see such cool run. This is such a great event and all the runs this week have been amazing. Let's keep those donations coming and take an RPG to cancer!
I just looked up from my lunch and noticed that the donation total has kind of stalled out. Hoping this donation might jump start things a little bit. Let's do it for Dance Dad and Dance Fam, and most importantly for charity. Thanks <3
There's a beautiful symmetry in a group of people raising money to fight cancer by watching a man eradicate tumorous growths with hot lead and explosives. Here's to shooting cancer with a rocket launcher (metaphorically). P.S. Great to see Leon in his R.P.D. gear again. Gotta love a man in uniform. He's such a *HONK* ;)
Bourrons les dons pour donner le cancer au cancer. Cancerption.#MarioLight
What are ya buyin'? Heh heh heh heh, thank yeh.
Choo Choo
I can't say no to a donation train, choo choo!
Here's $10 for the great gameplay and commentary for one of the best RE games ever. I'll send in another $10 if the runner and/or couch can do their best Merchant impression.
Vintage Spider-Man ftw!
Welp, I'm a man of my word. Here ya go, great run so far. Good luck on elevator!
CHOOOOOOO CHOOOOOOO!!!
All aboard the Final Fantasy $6 donation train! It's $5, plus one.
Always love watching my favorite game be broken at GDQ, keep up the great work.
RE4 is a game from my childhood that I'm too scared to play myself, so it's great being able to see it on my very first GDQ ♥
This one goes out to Mike, the best helicopter bro Leon could ask for...also Black Eagle house for Fire Emblem.
Had to donate for my first ever horror game
Hey Mike! Did you know that the novistadors in RE4 were unintended by the game’s code? In fact if you look at them you can see they are giant bugs.
Watching GDQ at work while my partner watches at home. Josie, if you hear this, I'm going to bring dinner home tonight, so don't cook. Please send another donation to confirm you heard this.
My best friend, my idol, my beloved grandmother died from cancer 2 years ago. She was the one I could call whenever and talk about whatever. No matter what, she understood. I still have her number on my phone. Thanks GDQ for this - for this awesome show and for all you awesome people.
$5 donation train for a FFVI run? There's no clipping out of bounds to bypass these tracks. Let's do it everyone! Chooo-chooo!
First time donating towards my first PS2 game. Amazing to see how easy Mikewave makes the game look! HYPE!
Greetings from Japan! Seeing Resi 4 on AGDQ fills me with nostalgia. I spent a decent chunk of my high school years speed running this game at my grandma's house, who we lost to cancer a few years later. Miss you, grams. Let's all do our best together to stop cancer! Also, "hey, it's that dog!"
You can use an incendiary grenade on the regenerators too =D
Did I hear that right? A Final Fantasy VI bonus game donation train? Count me in!
Thx for this great event!! :)
You are simply the best!
EH HEH HEH HEH... Thank you....
Trans rights!
Had to donate during RE4, one of the best games ever made. Shout out to my husband, sitting in the front row, who abandoned me for an entire week to hang out with his friends at AGDQ. All is forgiven though as he's decked out in his incredible Leon S Kennedy cosplay. Lookin' good, hot stuff! =)
Have to donate for MaxyLobes dropping the deep shopkeeper lore and that sick remix. Awesome commentary on a great run!

MikeWave, do you remember JTB's SGDQ 2015 RE4 run? Do you guys still enjoy the "Like you, I'm American!" cutscene? That was the run that got me into GDQ and speedrunning.

This RE4 run is fantastic. The commentary done by the runner and couch is amazing, keep up the great work you all! Barrel!

Please read during TLOU: Left Behind! Hey Ant, look on the bright side, at least you won't have to deal with Bill this run! Thank you so much to all the GDQ staff and runners that make such an amazing event possible! Donation goes to runners choice, incentive wise.
Had to donate during RE4, one of my favorite games of all time. This donation is dedicated to my mom, who beat breast cancer, my dad who beat lymphoma three times, and my Uncle who we lost to throat cancer two decades ago. Thank to everyone for this event. It’s something I look forward to every year.
Good luck with the run Ant! Love from Finland :)
Good luck with your run Anthony, was hoping to see a full Last of us run but Ill take an "Ellie" run.
So excited to see TLOU at GDQ!
I just found out that my great aunt passed away from cancer the other night. I'm donating in honor of her and all that she has done for this world.
Amazing show as always, thank you AGDQ and all runners!
Love you Ant, thanks for everything you've done for The Last of Us leading us to the point of meeting at the world class GDQ! Ellie is in the spotlight at last!
I first got into watching GQD runs thanks to AnthonyCaliber in late 2017, by stumbling upon one of his Last Of Us GDQ submission videos on his channel. This opened my eyes to the fun of a well-commented speedrun, and made me realize that probably ANY game could be run.That's when I started diving into the GDQ youtube archive, watching runs of all my favorite games. More than 2 years later, I'm glad to be watching him live for a crazy-fast speedrun of the best piece of DLC ever made.Thanks to everyone involved in making these incredible events, both on-screen and off-screen, and good luck to all the runners !
This is the first GDQ event I've watched live and it features a run from one my absolute favorite games ever. Let's find a cure to the cordyceps. Go Ant!
If you don't donate toward the FF6 bonus game, Kefka will unleash his light of judgment on you!
WE DID IT! Congratulations and good luck on the run Anthony - so happy for this accomplishment. Much love from the Ant Colony!
IF WE DON'T REACH THE DONATION GOAL FOR FF6 I WILL CRY :( (ps: i love you all)
Hyped for this VERY QUICK run, donation goes to runners' choice!

Hello to all.Had to donate for what SHOULD be the QUICKEST run in the event.Left Behind features Ellie and Riley, a cool pair even with all their flying Babu Friks.The donation goes towards FF VI Bonus Run. Get it in there!
Likely my last donation for the week, sadly. Thank you very much to all of the runners and organizers. This is such a great week for games and gamers!
This is awesome! Never expected to see The Last of Us on here, I'd love to see a run through the whole game but I'll take what I can get! Great decision putting this on here, hoping for more like this! Great cause for donation as well, thanks guys, and good luck Anthony!
Congrats to Ant for getting into GDQ. Even though this is just Left Behind, it's still big for both him and The Last of Us speed-running. From all of us at the Ant Colony, we're proud of you Ant.
[FR ]Let's go AGDQ ! Des bisous au FrenchRestream ! #DarkMage
Been watching GDQ for years, finally attending my first one and figured I would donate during one of my favorite games!
Hamburgers are my favorite, what is yours?
Hello everyone and greeting from Germany. my father was diagnosed with spinal cancer 2 years ago. By then he was rushed to a hospital and miraculously survived two harsh surgeries in a row and has been struggeling to recover since then. At this time my point of view on cancer drastically changed and I decided to help where I can to prevent people going through the same stuff my family did and still does. THANK YOU ALL for doing the stuff you've been doing for all those years. You people are amazing! Keep up the work and kick cancer's butt!

Shoutout to AnthonyCaliber for showing us such a quick and rad run! I'll be donating 10 dollars towards the FF6 run! Come on guys, Let's get this phantom train rolling! AYAYA!
I'm dedicating this donation to my dad Greg, who I lost in high school to cancer. He was always supportive of my love for games, and sometimes watched me play games like Jak and Daxter. Here's to you, Greg!
Had to donate during my favorite game, The Last of Us. I have been watching Anthony for years and am so glad he's at AGDQ this year. Good luck to AGDQ and all the runners. I appreciate all you're going for the Prevent Cancer Foundation.AGDQ HYPE!
Long time follower of your channel. I looked forward to this run all day. It's great to be able to watch you at GDQ, and donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation.
I didn´t convince anyone on my family to donate, but TLoU is my favorite game so I had to donate even if it´s 1/3 of my money. greetings for Chile
GO ANTHONY!!! I wish they would have given you the whole game to play instead of just the DLC.
When in doubt? Just honk!
Glad to be financially stable enough that I can donate to GDQs again! Put this towards Black Eagles for Three Houses. Edelgard is right!
Here's 10 and 5 dollars for the EDF 5 handcam. Can't wait to see halfcoordinated single-handedly saving our mother earth from any alien attack. EDF!!!
Hello Sooraya and GDQ! I've been absolutely absorbed in the horror block this year, huge props to all of those talented runners. A quick shout out to Cartridge Blowers and Raige as well, enjoy the rest of AGDQ, friends!

This goes to FF6 bonus game, really want to see my favorite game run
I heard I could donate to get Final Fantasy 6.
The Jak Trilogy were my most favorite games as a child. Jak 2 alone took me a whole year to finish, so I'm excited to see it getting destroyed today. Good luck to headstrong and sickynar!
Hello GDQ! I'm loving the marathon so far! Here's 25 to go for the FF6 bonus run.
Jak 2 is the game that got my girlfriend interested in speedrunning, because it is one of her favourite childhood games. I love you !Can't wait for the fire emblem run. Money goes to the Blue Lions house, because Mercedes is the best !
Love watching gdq for the last years and now gotta donate four this amazing race. May the sooner rng be there for you both. Incentive goes to winner's choice.
My mother has tackled both breast cancer and lung cancer in the past two years and is still going strong. This donation is for her.... and also for the Fire Emblem House whose wholesome and charming characters got me through some of those rough times. Fear the Deer!
Hey Headstrong and Sicky! Glad to see you both racing, hovering and zooming through Haven City to put an end to the Metal Head threat. Donation goes to Ultimate difficulty in Spider-Man because Playstation classics do need some love.
The outer part of the shadow is called the penumbra!
Loved Insomniac since the first Spyro game back in the day. Then they made an amazing Spider-Man game. Let's get that Ultimate Difficulty incentive met!
This is going towards the almighty Blue Lions in Fire Emblem Three Houses! Shoutout to my girlfriend Anne who continues to inspire me and loves speedruns as much as I do!
15 dollars for Jak 2, my edgey childhood game of choice!
FFVI is my favorite childhood game let's make it happen!
Good luck to headstrong and sicky! Rooting for you both from the rest of the jak community that couldn't make it!

Been watching GDQ for years now and just wanted to say, thank you so much to everyone involved for what you do.
This is for the dude in the front row whose been killing the hand drums for nearly every track this GDQ.
Long time watcher - First time donator.Hey Headstrong. Musa here - all the best for the race!Wishing everyone a great time.
Hi everybody! Let's continue being awesome at Awesome Games Done Quick!
My mom has been in remission from lung cancer for a few years now. We were lucky and caught it early in Stage 1A. If there hadn't been people like the Prevent Cancer Foundation working on this stuff, I could have lost my mom. Thanks for everything y'all do. Only wish I could do more. 1 Million HYPE!!!
Wishing both runners the best of luck. Staying up a few hours to watch Headstrong run Jak2 to fight cancer is always a good choice. :]
Looking forward to Jak 2, thanks for a great event so far everyone involved.
Final Fantasy 6 is one of my favorite games and I would love to see it this GDQ.
Cancer is bad.
I lost my mother recently to ovarian cancer, I hope that this donation will help save more lives, as well as help others not experience the loss of a close loved one.. my heart goes out to the cause!
Hey Sicky! Waga baba bobo! Too bad you lost the race, you'll get em next time at SGDQ 2019 4Head But for real, good luck to both runners, and thanks to the GDQ staff for the great work they do
I've been watching GDQ for years;Had to donate during the Jak 2 race, one of my favorite childhood games.It's awesome to see Gamers coming together for such an honourable purpose.Big shoutout to EVERYONE who makes this possible!
"honk" in french is "klaxonner";)
So glad to see one of my favorite PS2 games back at a GDQ event - and by two of the most elite runners in the community!Have a great race, and as Baron Praxis would say, "all hardlocks must die"!Donation goes to both runners' choices split 50/50 between them.
Hi Sicky! Wishing you the best of luck even though I know you won't need it. Excited to be here and watch! Much love!!
Merci encore a toute l'organisation GDQ et LFR. Bourrez les dons.Go André#Squidt
V--Donation incentive below!--VHey Em, it's your good friend Sir Dr Meme here. While I'm a little disappointed that we didn't reset at escape, for the joy of additional escapes, I am glad that the poignant practical praxis practice payed off plentiful. Anyway, I know you guys don't buy into my theory that using dark jak on last boss is faster, but I'd love to donate another 25 if someone managed to kill him with it. strongPout If you manage to get krew skip then all problems in the world will be put right, use your instincts. No crashing please. Cheers Em and Sicky, do the fast.
Thank you for organizing such a cool event for such a noble cause ! Excited to see all the future runs !
Hey GDQ! Had to donate during one of my favorite games, Jak 2. Good luck on the run and remember: this is a no hover zone!
I‘m so glad being able to watch the first GDQ ever aired! Have a good year 2010! Cant‘t wait to see you guys reach $10.000 - go for it!
I've been watching GDQ events for years now and this year's AGDQ is especially meaningful. This past July I was diagnosed with testicular cancer. Thanks to the advancements and knowledge that has grown through cancer research funded by donations like GDQ raises, the doctors were able to remove the tumor and get me cancer free even without chemo. Thanks to all of the runners, commentators and those behind the scenes at GDQ for all that you do!
Aye
Shout out to Sicky. Getting to watch a little at work, good luck on the race! Donation goes to runner's choice (split 5/5).
Been watching headstrong for a long time, always great to see her on the GDQ stage!
Hi hs and josh it's aloe here. Hope you two are doing great! My grandfather just passed away and I hope he is in a good place now... God bless everyone! HYPE HYPE HYPE
If everyone in chat donated $5 right now, we could raise approximately $675,000 immediately for a great cause. Please consider donating to help fight cancer. If you don't have the funds, please spread the word about the marathon and the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Also, remember that GDQ is donating all of its post-tax revenue received from Twitch subs and bits this January to the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Let's do our best for a great cause!
Hey HeadStrong, good luck on the race. But I do have to say Superman looks awfully weird.
Hey Jak gang its purpler! Hope you guys have a great run, had to make sure i got my donation in! Donation to runners' choices'
Wait jak is mar? On guard!
Had to donate during the run of my childhood license. thanks everyone for everythinks, lots of love, HONK !
I've been watching this marathon for a few years now, but never donated because I wanted to wait until I could give more. Sadly, last year I lost my mom to cancer that wasn't detected until it was too late. So I'm making this donation, to say that it's never too early to give to this important cause, and no donation is too small to make a difference. If we work together, I know we can kick cancer's butt.So this one is for you, mom. Even though I know you always regretted getting me that first game boy when I was 10, and hated driving to blockbuster so I could rent Jak 2 for the eighth time, those were the first steps to getting me involved with this awesome community. So everybody go fast, keep donating, and don't forget to keep honking.
The Jak trilogy was a formative game of my youth, and I'm glad to see it being ran here! Hey Naughty Dog, Trilogy remake a-la Crash N-Sane for Jak when?
Hello AGDQ! Love what youre doing! Lets smash cancer like these runners are smashing these runs! Looking forward to halfcoordinateds run! His runs always amaze me! Lets get hyped for 850K! LETS GO!
GG pour l'orga force aux ambianceurs et aux commentateurs.Bourrez les dons !#PokeLou
My girlfriend introduced me to the Jak series. I remember I had a hard time beating Jak 2. Good luck on the race guys.
Sorry for the interruption - Not to alarm anyone, but we are still quite a bit away from upgrading the Spidey run to ultimate difficulty! C'mon people we can do it, still almost an hour to go! Good luck to Headstrong and Sickynar on the Jak 2 run, may the best space-ferret-handler win!
Hey Headstrong, I was checking out your twitter and I saw you got engaged yesterday! Congrats! Even if you don't win the race, I think that means you won AGDQ. Donation goes to Headstrong's choice.
I've been waiting all week for this run! So happy I discovered the Jak community. And a special thanks to OutrageousJosh for letting me know about AGDQ! Good luck on the race! <3 Tsuki
This game was so hard and took me months to complete casually when I was young and I absolutely love watching you guys completely destroy it. Thank you for such an entertaining race!
Okay, but what is their favorite eggplant dish?
Shoutout to AGDQ staffer Samm - LIVE TOGETHER, DAB ALONE. Hope that helped, love #gaming-chat P.S. Pls come home and help us with this ticket, we’re scared
 (Comment rejected)
Hey, guys. Did you know that eggplants are also called aubergines?
Alright GDQ it's time for us to speedrun these next incentives. Let's get it done, here is 25 dollars towards the Spiderman difficulty upgrade.
The correct answer is eggplant parmesan
Merci pour tout le travail fournit et bon courage à vous. On crois au pouvoir de la licorne rose invisible et surtout des dons pour lutter contre le cancer ! #Goupix
How could you forget about me?!!! We shared an amazing time together just this week. P.S. I'm pretty sure the runners don't know who I am.Donation goes to announcers choice.
Had to donate during one of my favorite PS2 childhood games! So grateful for what AGDQ does for Cancer and giving me something to watch in the middle of the day and or night!
Hi! I'll donate another $100 if the runners or anyone else can tell us what "BSP" in the "Outside of BSP" message stands for.Shoutouts from a game dev :)Note for the host: The answer is Binary Space Partition.
Hello AGDQ !During last year's event, my grandfather was fighting cancer. Unfortunately, he has since lost the battle... But the war is not over ! With this event and this great community, we can all be of some help and kick cancer's butt ! AGDQ HYPE !
 (Comment rejected)
My Mom and I used to play this game like crazy next to the Ratchet & Clank Series. She died bc of breast cancer. I could never sell these games. I still have them for the PS2 laying around. Thank you for this opportunity to spend some of my money to a good cause for everyone. Gamers arise!
Jak fans keep asking for Jak 4 and I'm just here looking for the Kiera game. Jak and Samos got imprisoned, Daxter worked as an exterminator, first we hear of Kiera she's living her best life as a professional mechanic for a crime boss, what's this girl been up to for 2 years!All the best to the runners, and to the other donators and viewers. Y'all rock.
Hey all! Tester at Naughty Dog here! What a Crazy Run of Left Behind, and now This insane Jak 2 race! A bunch of us around the office managed to pool some money to chip in during this amazing event to express our support for community! Best of luck to all the runners!
Had to donate during my number 1 favorite game of all time! I love watching all the Jak games being broken, but 2 is forever special in my heart. Thank you to all the AGDQ staff for making this event possible, and thank you to everyone that is donating towards such a good cause. Let's beat cancer and all those metalheads!
Good night Tiger :)Have fun watching watching AGDQ everyone and lets kick cancers butt. ;)
howdy! hope yallsre havin a good day, going fast and havin a blast! i'm gonna donate to final fantasy vi and then i'm going back to bed. goodnight.
So many Spiderman donations. Where is the love for Jak 2?Let's give a big round of applause to our current amazing runners demolishing a favorite game from my childhood.
Spider-Man Ultimate Difficulty! Let's go!!
Woop woop for the nice event!
To the Jak 2 runners cause they sounded sad when all the donations were for spiderman.
I think dogs should be able to vote!
Let's get that Spider-Man ultimate incentive met! A $5 donation train would totally get us there. I believe in you Twitch Chat!
for the good cause and in hope of a TRUE jak 4! (one day... maybe...)
Lost my father to cancer 4 years ago. Let's kick its butt! Greetings from The Netherlands.
Long time viewer, first time donating. I just wanted to thank you all people for this absolutely wholesome movement which is GDQ. Thank you players, hosts, audience, viewers and of course, donators. Good vibes to all of you!
Go Spidey go! We can do it!
Long time viewer, first time making a donation! Shout out to all the awesome speed runners and this amazing cause! Plus... who wouldn't like to see Spiderman at Ultimate difficulty.
First time dono for a great cause. DOOONOOO TRAAAIN
I need two tickets for the $5 train, all aboard!!!!!
I'm a longtime fan of AGDQ and have donated every year since my brother introduced me to GDQ never thinking that Prevent Cancer Foundation would have any impact in my life. However, after losing my mother to an undiagnosed cancer last year, I realize just how important research, diagnostics, and outreach are to combating cancer. Every dollar AGDQ helps raise lessens the odds that another family will have to go through what my family went through last year. Thanks to everyone at AGDQ for helping to raise so much money for an incredibly important cause!
Donating during Jak II, go Headstrong & Sickynar!
Insomniac AND Naughty Dog games?! Forget the PS5 - I'm already in PSHeaven. Good luck to the runners!
All aboard the $5 train!
Long time fan. Been following since 2012. Glad I finally caught it live! Hello Will!
I was wanting to donate during the Spider-Man run after this awesome Jak 2 run, but we have to hit this ultimate difficulty incentive! HYPE!

I'm not gonna watch the Spiderman run because I don't want to spoil anything for when I eventually play it myself, but hey, it's still going to a good cause.
Did I hear a donation train. Trains are always good. Choo chooo!
SPIDEY TRAIN
Hey, some folks in chat knew it was Binary Space Partition, so here's the $100 I promised.
The Jak series is one of my childhood favorites, but Jak 2 was always the most difficult for me. Its fun seeing it in a race setting this GDQ and I'm loving every second of it!
Obligatory long time watcher - first time donator. Donating now for Fire Emblem: Three Houses as I can't be awake to watch it later. This game launched Three Emblem to one of my favourite game series of all time and I went out and bought three other Fire Emblem games like three days later. Put this money towards de-three-ting cancer and supporting the Golden Three house because it has all of the best characters, like Lysith-three-a and Leone-three. Loving all the runs so far and looking forward to staying up to watch the next three games tonight. I'll donate another $13.33 if one of the runners or anyone on the couch can correctly guess how many times I got the announcer to say "three" reading this donation. Let's critical hit cancer and save the world!
The bosses expected to see a casual player... But it was him ! Gyoo !!!Thanks for this wonderfull event you're all breathtaking
I'm not able to donate as much as the last GDQs but every $ helps. Keep up the awesome work!
Let's get that Ultimate difficulty for Spider Man unlocked!

Good luck to all runners!
AGDQ is my favorite thing to watch at my cubicle and then minimize when management walks by. Love this event - keep up the good work!
Naughty Dog as a whole has had a wonderful impact on my life. From my childhood memories with the Jak series to playing through all of the Uncharted games with my wife they've never stopped giving me stuff to smile about. Proud as heck to have a username inspired by this series and hope everybody working/running at AGDQ has a wonderful day.
Today's my Dad's birthday and we both love Spider-Man. Let's hit that Ultimate difficulty incentive!
Here's $25 for Spider-ma... nah, I wanna see Half-Coordinated's skill with the hand-cam.

If everyone in Twitch chat donated $10 right now, we could immediately more than double what's been raised so far. If you can't donate, please spread the word about the marathon and the Prevent Cancer Foundation!
First time donating so my husband can see his favorite Marvel game played live!!
GL to all the runners from Andy, Tree and Hamez, on their sofas in London
Hey there, ladies and gentlemonsters! Here's some cash for Headstrong to buy some ammo and also fight cancer! Friend of me and I are developing a small indie game and hope, that one day it may be played at GDQ! Love Jak 2, love GDQ, love all of you, brave runners! (But mostly our announcer's voice - it's just too sweet <3)!

Remember Runners: with great speed comes great aerodynamic friction. Beware wind burns while swinging around in your underwear.
Donating for Parodi Jackson and the beautiful musik he's playing he's making in the yetee booth :)
I want to dedicate this particular run to my cousin Andrew. He’s a big Spider,an fan. Unfortunately, he and his siblings lost their mother a few years ago due to cancer. She has inspired us to keep fighting and pushing forward no matter what life throws at you. If my cousins are hearing this, I want them to know that their mom is very proud of them, and I love you, Andrew, Michael and Princess. And to Aunt Luu, we love you, too. With great power, comes great responsibility!
Gogo Spidey Ultimate!
Helmet Guy here, sad to not be there in person (my Bean-with-Bacon Megarocket is in the shop) but here's hoping I can make the trip in the future! Good luck to the Spider-man runners, lets see those underoos!

please ultimate difficulty please
Hi, I'm Estantia and I help commentate OoT Randomiser on zeldaspeedruns. About 5 minutes ago my Dad passed away from cancer. There's nothing I can do for him, but I can do something for others. Thank you.
First time donating - but gimme those interesting ultimate strats! also shoutouts to halfcoordinated, he inspired me to pick up speedrunning momodora after agdq some time ago. much love to everyone - but not cancer! cancer gets the HONK!
Every year dozens of GDQ incentives are met with aplomb, but for just $5.00 you can help sponsor an unmet incentive. For the cost of a overpriced cup of coffee, Ultimate difficulty can join the ranks of the loved, met donation incentives. Together we can make sure that no incentive goes unmet, and all games are as long and difficult as possible. Add coal to this donation train, you can make a difference.
I suddenly don't want pictures of Spiderman anymore.
Noticed I had ad block on! Turned it off and had to compensate by donating.Also Ultimate Difficulty go!All the love from Sweden.

Long time viewer from Barcelona, let's keep playing games as fast as we can!
Excited to see my FAVORITE game of 2018 on AGDQ!

Half way through the run, here's my part to a 10 Dollar Train for Maximum Spider! Wait... wrong! Still, keep up the good work GDQ!
I was waiting to donate for later, but whatever. I need to see more Spiderman. Gimme the Ultimate run!

We are Venom and we hate Spider-Man BUT we hate cancer more! We want this to be as difficult as possible for that troublesome spider! Keep up the donations or we will eat your brains!
More difficulty. More high-fives.
It's canon that Spiderman listens to podcasts while he's waiting for missions.
Well there is a Ultimate Spider-manCoincidence? I Think NotLet the train continue
Boys want girls. Real men like me want pictures of the ultimate difficulty for spider-man right now!
You know I'm something of an Ultimate Difficulty type of person!
Spidey babe, you kicked that trash can soo good! call me ;)
I know Spider-Man’s secret identity and I will now reveal it to the world.....Spider-Man is actually....ORB!
Please untag me from this thread. I am not interested in spider man.
WHOA, he stole that guy's PIZZA!
I need more GDQ content before work! Go Spiderman!
Does no one else think it's weird that this dude is slinging around New York City in his underwear... while wearing his mask!? I would reeeeally love to hear the explanation for this.
One Pepperooni with extra ultimate please
Since MJ canonically develops a preventable cancer due to her relationship with Spiderman, what better run to donate to than this?
Weird, when I go to New York City in nothing but a Spider-Man mask and my underwear all I get are weird stares and disapproving head shakes, not high fives. Anyway, put this towards ultimate difficulty.
Is it really Spider-Man if it's not Ultimate difficulty?
Choo choo!
You guys forgot to tip the pizza delivery guy! Here's 5 dollars for that, I know he wanted to see Ultimate difficulty too.
Let’s meet that Ultimate incentive and kick cancer’s butt, Spidey Style. HIGH FIVE!!!

Had to donate for a HalfCoordinated run! Always enjoy his runs and commentary. Also, he apparently uses the same color scheme for his mech that I prefer in every game I play, so bonus points for that! Because of his impeccable taste, donation goes to runner's choice.
I have not been able to really donate money since I'm at the event this time.So I'll just throw all the money I wanted to donate throughout the week at halfcoordinated because he is amazing. EDF
Hi half, I just wanted to say: EDF! EDF! EDF!. Keep it up the great work, GDQ, sending love from Brazil.
Heya Half and agdq! Saw that halfcoordinated was running at a somewhat reasonable time for me and had to donate now that I have the money for it. Love your work for accessibility in gaming, so keep on being awesome! EDF! EDF!
Hey Halfcoordinated, as a gamer who can only use one hand, you're a huge inspiration! Keep up the good workEDF!!!!
EDF! EDF! ED HALF! ED HALF!Been waiting all week for the EDF Run, can't wait to see Half save the day. I'm hoping this money goes to rebuilding the cities that unfortunately will be destroyed as collateral damage against the alien army. Incentive Goes to Half's choice.

HC I love all of your runs. Keep up the accessibility talk! Some folks still need to hear it!
Might have missed it, but there was something about EDF?
EDF isn't a game I know that well, but u wanted to support halfcoordinated's run! I have chronic pain in my dominant hand and taught myself how to play games left-handed. His advocacy means so much to me, and I know to many others. Thank you so much! Runners, remember to give your wrists a break, and take care of yourselves. Have a good AGDQ!
Even though you are our SON,We're not going to use a cheesy PUN.Since you're running around shooting your GUN,Trying to have a fast speed RUN.Just save the earth and have some FUN!Peace Out,DaddyLongBeard and MomPS: EDF! Kick Cancer's butt!

Hi halfcoordinated, thank you for your wonderful personality and your awesome speedruns - watching your runs helped me stay positive while my mum was fighting cancer for the last two years.I hope you'll have a PUNderful run today - Wooooaaah!
Hope everyone is having a great day/night keep killing those bugs and hopefully killing cancer too
I'm sorry, but I'm pretty sure it legally can't be called a proper Devil May Cry 5 playthrough unless we see the Faust cutscene, so my money is going towards that goal. Regardless, though, can't wait for that run! Hyped!
Would you like to know more? Wait wrong alien bugs. EDF! EDF!
EDF the only game where more bugs is a good thing. Good luck on the run half. EDF! EDF! EDF!
Who is this Fencer and why is he faster than me?
Just wanted to donate during my favorite runner's slot. Good luck woth the run and may there be much dancing. EDF!P.S. Speaking of dancing, lets get that DMC5 Faust cutscene incentive met!
Never miss a Halfcoordinated run—he's the hero Earth needs. EDF!!
In memory of one my best childhood friends, my granddad.
EDF is my fiancee and I's favorite franchise, and I'm so happy to see it at GDQ! E-D-F!
Thank you halfcoordinated for continually highlighting accessibility. Unless your game can be played by everyone in the world, it can't truly have a *world* record.
Even though I can hardly watch any runs this time because I have to study for my upcoming exames I will most definitely not miss my chance to donate. So here you go, take my money and do something good with it. And now I just wanna wish you all a nice day... no a nice week... no forget it, I wish you all a awesome 2020.
I love EDF 5. But 4.1 songs are better.To save our mother Earth from any alien attack!From vicious giant insects who have once again come back!We'll unleash all our forces we won't cut them any slack!The E D F deplooooooooys!
I temporarily injured my hand and my husband said I couldn’t play video games. I said HALF COORDINATED CAN DO IT SO I CAN TOO! And I did! Thanks for giving people hope. EDF?
My god, they look just like us! Anyway, glad to see my favorite co-op game run at GDQ and for such a great cause! PCF! PCF! PCF!
Shoutout to my friends Pyrodragon and Tin! Save the Earf from cancer!

All my life I totally learned the alphabet wrong. Obviously it goes A.... B.... C.... EDF
Final Fantasy 6? Yes please!
EDF! Good work, homie. Also though, homie in the sandals, hmu you'd look good in my living room playing video games w my dogs.
Gotta get those bonus games in!
in 2005 i was diagnosed with brain cancer at the start of my 6th grade school year. I was treated with chemo and radiation and was declared in remission by the end of the school year in 2006, because of this GDQ and it's mission has held a special place in my heart since I discovered it in 2012, and I also love to see how these games can be utterly destroyed. Lets keep donating to charity and avoid missing any more of these great incentives.
I was going to wait for the MMX race for my donation, but the chanting, dancing, and singing is too good to simply just watch. Thanks to everyone at AGDQ for another great event and to Halfcoordinated for this great run!
Thanks for all of the great runs so far. Always love this event. Thank you to everyone who makes it possible.
PCF! PCF! PCF! PCF!
It's EDF baby!
The EDF deploys!
I'm getting 7 more verses than expected?! You get 7 more 25s!!
Run, run or you'll be well done!
$5 donation phantom train for that bonus FF6 new game+ run AND to help PCF AND for the...EDF! EDF!
I didn't know it was possible to speed run solo in this game. This is amazing. Even with 4 people we fail all the time.
Half, you inspire us all. Here's FIFTYFOUR dollars, for bonus game 4.
As an amateur EDF player, I find this run fascinating. Thanks for giving the game some well-deserved love.
Putting my donation towards getting Final Fantasy 6 new game+ into the event because the world needs to see this amazing run from a fantastic runner. Good luck Neerrm!
Sadly, I don't get to actually watch my favorite speedrunner do all manner of goofy things in a goofy game live, but I can donate more money during his run! Put this toward's halfcoordinated's choice.
Greetings from Germany to all gamers, incredible performance that is provided by everyone. Not to forget great respect to all commentators from all restream channels
E to the D to the F!
It's easy, I see HalfCordinated running a game, I donate. I have thoroughly enjoyed every game I have seen you run at any GDQ. Putting this to FF VI, because I want the marathon to run for longer.Keep on gaming my man.
Hey, I had to donate during Half's run! Had my grandmother die from very aggressive cancer a few years ago, here's to kicking it in the rear, much like those ins- er, monsters! oh yeah, EDF!
TO SAVE OUR MOTHER EARTH FROM ANY ALIEN ATTACK!
Didn’t realize I’d be watching the greatest game ever! EDF!
To the EDF heroes on the back couch - thank you for your fun high energy that keeps GDQs going! To halfcoordinated, thank you for this awesome run and for dedicating yourself to game accessibility. To Twitch chat - let's upgrade that DMC5 run to Devil Hunter Difficulty!!! Thanks for the amazing week everyone. <3
Who are we raising money for?PCF!
Here is to an amazing EDF run.
Thanks for being so visible and advocating so hard for all of us disabled gamers! EDF!
"Accessible design is good design" This truth has earned another $25 from me, this time watching at work.
Love halfcoordinated! What's an EDF member's favorite cancer prevention charity?
This has been an amazing GDQ, thank you all for your hard work!Donation goes to runner's choice
This game is bonkers. Lets try this: P-C-F! Did I do that right?
I had to donate during HalfCoordinated's run. He is, as always, an inspiration. Any time anyone says playing video games is a waste of time I just have to show them any of his videos: you don't have to know or like video games to understand how they are serving him as a medium to inspire and share powerful messages regarding perseverance, accessibility and inclusion. By him doing what he does we all win, because a world that learns to become more aware, conscious, considerate and accepting of any one difference, is a world more likely to accept all differences, and there is not a single one of us who is not in some way different and we can all benefit from a more accepting world. Thank you.

Hey Half! I've been waiting for you to be at GDQ since your Nier: Automata run at SGDQ 2017. I didn't have the money to donate during that run, but I've been holding onto this one for two years straight:Nier: Auto-mahna mahna, doo dooooo doo do dooLove watching you run, and your tenacity is an inspiration to everyone! Donation goes to runner's choice!E D HALF!

Oh man, it's sure great to watch an EDF 5 run after watching, uh, spiiiii... Sony's Spah-Spiiii-Ah right. Sony's aggressive Alien Species Beta-man. EDF!
Donating towards the Final Fantasy 6 incentive. Beat this game for the first time last year and have to see it run at GDQ now! Let's get those donations in towards this run!
Cry EDF and let slip the Rapid Hounds of War!
What Pokemon do EDF soldiers pet at the end of a mission?EEVEE--Always love Half runs.
Long time watcher, first time donate. Please put this towards the Fire Emblem Three Houses bid war for the Golden Deer house. They might be a bunch of misfits that do not a-deer to the standards of the other houses, but they are near and deer to my heart. So either way it is sure to be a Golden Experience of a run and the runner should be a-Claude-d for that!
Do we get to see the bad idea gun in the speedrun? Please oh please oh please
Thanks to Half and the GDQ for showing games can do good. Half seems to live and breathe this, and I could not bee-lieve my luck that one of my favorite speedrunners got webbed into doing another GDQ. Please don't insect this too hard for any puns, that'd just be weevil. EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF! EDF!
ESD! Ha ha ha! Loving this run and learning about accessibility in games. Putting this towards FF6 - I have to know how my childhood favourite is getting destroyed!
I know that you'll single-handedly save earth! Thank you for fighting the good fight against cancer! EDF!!!
Earth couldn't have found a better defender than halfcoordinated. Good luck with the human-like aliens and giant insects! EDF! Donation goes to runner's choice.

FF VI plz
Hello! Thank you!
I love all of youEDF
$10 dollar donation train for final fantasy 6?
When I first played EDF, I always had to make the observation there was a lot of collateral damage. This lead to a lot of jokes about what EDF actually stood for. Among them are Earth Defense Farce, and Earth Destruction Force. Anyone else have any good ones?
Nothing better than a rousing song to keep the EDF train going!
This is to help show everyone the best cutscene of the year, maybe even the decade.
FF6 Dontation Train. Choo Choo

EDF, DMC, EDF, DMC!
Shout out to the best girlfriend in the world for watching speed runs with me, I love you, Destiny <3 Devil May Cry is her favorite series, good luck on the run!
Thought I'd drop a big one just before one of my favorite games from last year, Devil May Cry 5. This event means more to me now than ever before; early last year, I lost my aunt to cancer, and later in the year my grandmother was diagnosed with breast cancer herself. I was scared I'd lose a fourth family member in the past 5 years, but thanks to early detection and quick action, she's had the lump removed and her odds of survival are looking great. It cannot be overstated how important this cause is, and to see our gaming community band together to raise money and awareness about it is inspiring. Let's pull our Devil Trigger, and Round Trip cancer into oblivion!
Just got off work to be pleasantly surprised by a run by halfcoordinated. Thanks for starting my evening on such a great note!
This is the first time I've been able to donate despite watching GDQ since 2014. Just after GDQ began, my mother developed thyroid cancer and survived. What you guys do is just so wonderful. Put this towards the FFVI run, it is one of my favorite games of all time and I hope it meets the incentive! Honk and EDF!
(Special message for DECosmic, please save for after introductions & before run starts, if possible. #rundmc)Hey, Cosmic. Sorry I couldn't be there in person, but it's still a great feeling seeing you there presenting at GDQ, knowing you as long as I have. Remember that if the run doesn't go as you wanted, we are all just happy to see you up on that stage today, so don't stress things and have a great time.Love you, bro. "Remember what we used to say?"
If everyone in Twitch chat donated $10 right now, we could immediately more than double what's been raised so far. If you can't donate, please spread the word about the marathon and the Prevent Cancer Foundation!
FF6! FF6! FF6! FF6! Choo choo!
We gotta get that FFVI run in!
Did you think there'd be no donations towards increasing the difficulty? Foolishness, Dante... Foolishness.
Go go go, can't miss a FF VI run!
To be frank the Faust cutscene is one the best things from last year of gaming, it needs to be seen.
final fantasy six more like final fantasy please let's get this incentive met
Had to put a donation towards FF6. The best final fantasy other than Chrono Trigger.
Cosmic has done so much for the DMC speedrunning community, me included. So glad to see DMC5 at AGDQ. Donation to runners choice.
Gotta donate for Riven legit. It's my favourite raid encounter in all of Destiny, and I've raided for over a thousand hours across both games.
Good luck with the run Claris!
It's time to get this party started!!! Or at this point, keep it going! Not only do I get to donate during DMC5, but I get to donate towards Final Fantasy 6, my introduction to jRPGs and a doorway into my love for Final Fantasy as a whole. Let's get a $5 train suplexed, everyone! Here's my $25 dollars because I just (kefka impression if you can) hate hate HATE HATE HATE HATE cancer!!!
First time catching a gdq event live and loving every minute. Thanks to everyone involved
ATTENTION TWITCH CHAT: We have a mission. Get Final Fantasy 6 met. We do not have much time. Let's get a 5 dollar donation train going 30 minutes into the DMC5 run. We can do this. We WILL do this. Make it happen. Get it done.PS shoutouts to my posting pals in the SomethingAwful AGDQ thread.
Twitch says there are over 117,000 viewers watching the stream right now. Surely we can all pitch in $5 each and not only get the FFVI incentive, but also hit $1 million tonight! Let's keep this train rolling!
Devil May Cry was my favorite game from 2019. Final Fantasy VI is my favorite game ever. This is going to be one heck of a night...if we get that incentive. C'mon, people, let's hit it!
Who doesn't want more GDQ? Lets get that FF6 bonus game everyone!
Been loving the marathon so far. I had to donate for the Fire Emblem House Choice, and even though I've been streaming a Blue Lions playthrough on my channel, Golden Deer was my first run, so the money is going towards Claude!
Let's get Final Fantasy 6 at AGDQ!
Lets go ff6!

We are the warriors of light and dark! Let's see that final fantasy 6 run.~ Come on final fantasy community rise up for the fight against cancer!
My husband keeps bugging me to play Final Fantasy VI, and I know I should, but I have so many other games to catch up on too! Maybe he'll let me watch it instead? Let's unlock that bonus game!
NG+ in FFVI sounds like a glitchy nightmare.Gimme.
6 times 6 for Final Fantasy VI!
Good luck on the run Lucas, you got this and remember when vergil wave dashes just block the hellsweep bro.
Final Fantasy VI is one of my favorite games of all time and I'm looking forward to seeing this New Game+ mode!
Adding an NG+ to FFVI sounds amazing, let's see it!
I can never get enough GDQ, let's donate to make sure all the Bonus Games get played too!
Hooooooonnnnnnkkkkkk!!!
FF6 is one of my favorite games, so let's see it destroyed by an Any% run!
WE NEED FINAL FANTASY
This goes to FF6 let's make it happen.
Hey GDQ, been a hot minute since I've been able to donate but 2020 has started off good for me so I'm sharing the love. Let's put an end to cancer, the true final boss of humanity, once and for all! Donation goes towards the Golden Deer route in Fire Emblem Three Houses, because Raphael is the loveliest, most wonderful and wholesome character in anything ever and deserves to be seen on the GDQ stage. Also, #FearTheDeer
Hi there. We've had you guys up at our office all week. Thank you. Cancer sucks.
only night i can watch this gdq... so put this toward FF6!!!
The chocobo is the most noble of animals. It would be a shame if these noble creatures aren't shown.
Let's go FF6 make this GDQ even longer!
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
My wife and I have been having a blast watching this year, and I'm already planning to attend SGDQ 2020! Putting my donation towards the Final Fantasy VI incentive so y'all can showcase one of the best Final Fantasy games ever!
agdq still going strong after all these years is great.
Let's get FFVI into the marathon

It's the wacky woohoo pizza man adventure!$50 for the Dante Jackson scene
As much as I want to see Riven beaten correctly, I think an extra game is more important. Let's get that FF VI hype!
Let's get a $5 donation train going for FF6 Bonus Game run
i need thiss run to happen
Final Fantasy VI needs to happen! This means we should start a train. Here is $25, $5 for myself and 4 others, to get this started!

All aboard the Final Fantasy VI train!
Heard there is a FF6 donation train starting. So 2 tickets for me and my wife!
It’s been so much fun to watch these great runs that I have to donate for a bonus game.
Watching GDQ while I study programming. The greatest "free" entertainment you can get twice a year. So I'm happy to donate something for all the joy it brings me. If you can afford it, please give what you can to support a great charity and so we can all watch FF6. <3

Hey everyone, got too hyped during that last run to not stay up for one of my favourite games! Met my lovely wife Lunnie through the DMC series, so these hold a special place in my heart. Let's make that Faust cutscene happen and hit that Jackpot! Since my last donation went to that, let's send this one towards FFVI instead! Wouldn't want to be a Deadweight!
I wanna hear that Kefka laugh, let's donate for that FF6 run!!!!
Thanks for running DMC5, guys! Really love this game. So glad DMC is back! Jackpot!
Gotta donate to the FF6 bonus run so all the fans can see it. Love GDQ, love the great runs people put together, and shout out to Winter. Good luck, have fun, and kick cancers butt!

I donated earlier today as part of a $5 train for the FFVI run. I'm back to help cover for 6 others who might not be able to afford it this year. Let's make that FFVI run happen!
Lets get that final fantasy 6 run going!!!! First time donating love this event this is my favorite time of the year! SKODEN!
Thank you all for your hard work everyone!
J'aime TOUS les sports ! Mais j'aime surtout le speedrun ! #ConseilDes4
If everyone watching donated just $5, we could SMASH the incentive for FFVI! Come on everyone! We can do it!
Lets get that Final Fantasy VI run met. If met that will put us at $950,000 by 9PM. 1 million before midnight hype!
My 2019 was pretty garbage but getting into the Devil May Cry series was a huge highlight. I'm so in love with this series now and I'm so excited to see it run at AGDQ!
Aller aller, pour André, qui m'a bercé dans mes visionnages de Princess Bride toutes ces années (un grand classique).Merci à toute l'équipe du French Restream, vous êtes au top, tous/toutes! Coeur coeur
First of 2 planned donations for this Marathon, just caught the tail half of that EDF run by half (a fun game by one of my favorite runners). Looking forward to hopefully seeing that FFVI run (30 mins to beat that game sounds insane).
How can we possibly leave an ff6 run out of GDQ? Can we get a 5$ train going? I'll give it a jumpstart!
The time has come and so have I.TrickSwordTrickSwordTrickSwordTrickSwordTrickSwordTrickSword
Donating for Dante's smooth moves! Let's show cancer our Smokin' Sick Style and remember to stay motivated! Good luck on the run!
Last week my favorite Free Enterprise streamer said we needed to donate for Neerrm's run, so here is my share.
Donating during my favorite game of last year. Keep it up, and let's get that FF6 incentive!
First time donating and just wanted to attempt to start a $5 train towards fighting riven legit, let's make Datto happy! And of course, Decosmic, may RNGesus be with you!
Decosmic is going fast and so should we. FFVI incentive is near the bottom of the incentive choices, but it's right after Devil May Cry on the schedule. Don't be fooled! Let's get that bonus game.
This stream is about to get CRAZY!
I see you NEED MORE POWER!!! From playing fighting games in Curtis' basement to running DMC5 at ADQ. good luck on your run Lucas, from your pal Kyle. Also Hi Brandon keep up the moral support.
Already loving this run of Devil May Cry 5. You know what else I'd love? Us making the bonus fame of Final Fantasy VI happen. Pretty sure we can do it, so let's keep those donations coming!
Long time watcher, first time donator- DELAWARE HYPE! It’s so crazy to see people I know at a GDQ! I knew DECosmic WAY back in high school when he had WAY more hair! My step-mother was diagnosed with cancer this year, so what better time to donate!! Hello to Cosmic and Brandon on the couch, donation goes to runners choice!
This is shaping up to be a Devil of a run but I May Cry if we don't get that FF6 bonus game. We Dante wanna miss it by Nero margin folks.
Greetings from switzerland.
As a fellow DMC5 runner I will say with all my heart that if we didn't have someone like Cosmic running and helping this game grow and get more optimized we wouldn't have such an active game. I belive that if he didn't make the being part of the community such an enjoyable thing I would probably not have stopped running this game a long time ago. Thanks for the good times and the great times to come. Good luck on the rest of the run. #rundmc

I want to see us kick cancer harder than we'll kick Kefka's butt!
I want to say my thanks to Cosmic for being an amazing runner. He's pushed the DMC community forward and helped me personally by pushing me on. Thank you. There's a bunch of us sat in a voice call rooting you on. Good luck in the run and hopefully You Know Who in mission 19 decides to play nice! #RunDMC
Bang, bang, bang, pull my Devil Trigger!

Shout-outs to DECosmic from Capcom UK. I’ve been looking forward to this run all day, and that RUN DMC t-shirt was an inspired choice. This run already deserves a Smokin’ Sexy Speed rank.
Let's all help fight cancer and Destiny 2 easter eggs!
Putting my 10 bucks towards the best Final Fantasy game ever made. Thank you to all the runners and organizer for your hard work. Sending love and positive vibes from Panama!
When are we playing marvel 3 again?
Final Fantasy 6 is my absolute favorite Final Fantasy. I need to see what this new game+ is all about.
My husband and I have enjoyed watching GDQ since 2014 together. Please put my donation towards Final Fantasy so I can watch my husband's mind get blown away due to the epic speed of the run.
Thanks for doing this guys.
Final Fantasy 6 is one of my favorite games of all time, and I would love to see it beaten quickly and in a new way. Let's get this game in the marathon!
Donating to Black Eagles before FE3H because it's best route and I haven't beat Golden Deer yet *sad honk*
Good day everyone, hope the event is trying everyone well. Shoutout to vashy boy and his commentary. Hope you and the rest of the boys are enjoying yourselves and I’m excited to watch this run of your favorite DMC. Put this towards the golden deers for the 3 houses run. Deer gang rise up.
Good money for a good cause, and a good incentive to boot!
Donating to see some FFVI. Chat thinks we won't make it, but I'm not so sure. How about six bucks for FFVI?
ofc i had to donate for the dmc5 run featuring cosmic from the devil may cry series. gl to cosmic, greetings to the couch and kick cancers ass. JACKPOT! #rundmc
Final Fantasy 6 HYPE!!!
Cosmic, so incredible seeing you and the team doing this run live. Best of luck and keep up the amazing work. Millz and the gang are all rooting for you.
I've successfully burned through over 9GB of mobile data only four days into my monthly refresh. Obviously, this isn't enough. We need that Final Fantasy bonus game to maximize my data usage!
"Don't you dare say it-!""Jackpot!"
I have to say this run gets me MOTIVATED! Big love from myself and the Discord Team
Gotta see that FF VI run!
Donating to support my boy in his DMCV run and help fight cancer! Good luck to all the remaining runners!!
Final Fantasy VI is still my favorite of the series and I would love to see a new category run at GDQ. Keep those donations coming!
If we actually get FFVI in time, I'll donate another $100.
Always amazing to see my favorite series get love at GDQ, and I'm definitely using that Artemis strat in my next playthrough. Here's $25 for the best Sparda twin...Vergil!
First time donating to gdq, love what you guys do
Yo let's make FF6 happen!
As a fellow DMC5 runner I will say with all my heart that if we didn't have someone like Cosmic running and helping this game grow and get more optimized we wouldn't have such an active game. I belive that if he didn't make the being part of the community such an enjoyable thing I would probably not have stopped running this game a long time ago. Thanks for the good times and the great times to come. Good luck on the rest of the run. #rundmc
Let's get that FF6 run met! FF6 is the only final fantasy game I've managed to finish and a new game+ run sounds fantastic!
Happy to see the Destiny 2 community support such an amazing cause! Will donate 2x more if the raid team finishes 2 mins above the estimated time in remembrance of Datto.

Come on I still believe in ff6
Cant donate much but had to donate during my friends run. Good luck on the run DECosmic and slay those demons!
C'mon--let's get the legit Riven fight incentive met!
Ah, watching Devil May Cry 5 get decimated, while waiting for Final Fantasy VI to receive the same treatment. What could be better than this? Oh yeah, kicking cancers butt.
I'm a simple man, I see Final Fantasy bonus game incentive and I donate. Let's get that FF6 incentive met!
FF6 Please!
Hey Felly here. I see the chat being cute and donating for FFVI, but...something is missing. We need the live audience to encourage the cute chat. Can the audience give us a "Lets Go Twitch Chat" chant to rev those donation motors? UwU
SMOKIN SEXY STYLE!
Let's get that final fantasy run.
DEVIL MAY CRY IS BACK!
5 dollar train for the best Final Fantasy? Let's do this!

The Devil May Cry games have a real special place in my heart, and being able to catch this run is an absolute delight. Putting this donation towards the Faust scene, it's an absolute delight. Pull the Devil Trigger on Cancer! AYYO!
Come on folks, let’s not be dead weight! Let’s score a jackpot and see that Faust cutscene! If we want it, we’ll have to take it!

Donating for my daughter. Her great grandmother, my grandmother, died of breast cancer at 44 before I was born. Hopefully this will be one step closer to defeating cancer for good.
Much love from this bad take monster. Shout out to my boy Vash for putting in the work to help on commentary.

Keep up the great work, everyone!
What an exciting devil may cry run! This game looks awesome to run. Donation goes to the final fantasy run. We can do it!
Long-time donator, first-time watcher. This game looks fun. Put my money towards saving the Final Fantasies, but killing the Kefka.... Did I do this right?
Hi Cosmic ! So happy to see you on stage today, please make sure Dante gets pizza so everyone will be hungry by the end
Final Fantasy 6? yes please
I've just done the math- if literally 1/10th of the people watching the stream donate $6 each we'll hit the incentive for the bonus game- so let's start a six dollar train for final fantasy 6!SIX FOR SIX, SIX FOR SIX, SIX FOR SIX!
Gotta Donate for my main man Claude. Fear the Deer
My Aunt recently passed away from Colon Cancer so I’m donating this in honour of her. Rest In Peace Auntie Doreen.
Hey GDQ, your friendly vet tech reminding everyone that preemptive screening is just as important for dogs and cats as it is for humans. If Milo or Otis are getting up there in years, make sure they get regular bloodwork and physicals by your family's other doctor!
Yo
I have to donate for my favorite mall goth, V!
Loving the run, keep it up! Jackpot!!!!!!!!
Final Fantasy 6 new game plus? That can't be a real thing... can it? I have to know the truth! Show me the error of my ways!
First time I've been able to watch live! Gotta throw some money towards FF6 and see someone do something I've never done - finish the game.
Hey Cosmic, super proud of all you've achieved here, and I'm sure the DMC community is too. I'm so happy for of you and look forward to seeing what you do next. Lots of love from Down Under!
Shoutout from Delaware!
Let's show off how to beat this dragon legit, oh runners mine
Who would of thought a decade ago that I met a Dante Fanboy & a Zero Fanboy in a basement playing fighting games in Delaware. The same people I traveled up and down the road for a number of years who always supported me, but now it is my time to support you. The DCB crew from the 302 are proud of you Lucas, good luck on your run & keep those puns coming...$10 to Cosmic's choice $10 to BMAO's choice
Sweet stache
First time donator! Been watching for 6 years now and I get so excited every time GDQ starts and so sad when it ends. I can't get enough of watching people blow through games that took me weeks to finish. $5 to the FF6 incentive. You're all awesome. Can i get a honk-honk?
Good luck to Decosmic on this sick DMC 5 run. First time watching one, and it's great! Donation goes towards Blue Lions house for Fire Emblem. Congrats to all the runners and the GDQ staff, all the hard work you put into these events is much appreciated!
Massive props to my homie Cosmic making it in the big leagues, he deserves it after all the work he's put into the DMC speedrunning community, he helped out so many runners, including me, when we were getting started and he really put in the effort to grow a great speedy community, and now he gets to show off one of the greatest games ever for a great cause. Now enough sappy talk, get out there and beat that game fast mr Cosmos, huge love! #rundmc
You are getting to do two things you like to do: Speedrun Devil May Cry, and dish out painful puns. Keep up the good work. #rundmc
Shoutout to the DMC Squad! Mundus would be proud
Here's a donation to get Final Fantasy VI! It's one of my favorite games ever and also being played for an amazing cause.
If Datto has to do Riven cheese he might die from shame.
What's Dante's favorite dessert?Devil May Pie!
Let’s get a donation train going to meet the FFVI bonus game. If even a fraction of viewers puts in $5 for it we’ll see it met. Come on!
Thought I'd finally donate as DMC 5 is one of my favorite games and series. Good luck to the runner and let's kick cancers ass!
Kupo? Kupo kupo kupo !
Hi GDQ! This is like my 5th year watching and you guys always put on an amazing show. Hoping for that FFVI run. Let's get it done!!
5$ train for FF6!
It would be 'TERRA'ble if we miss the Final Fantasy VI run. I think making this incentive is a 'Locke', but it will take all of us to keep 'Sabin' the day against cancer.

Yo, Cosmic! Thanks for all you do for the stylish action game community. I'm glad to have you around in my streams sometimes. Good luck on your run, and I hope you run Assault Spy more! Keep it stylish!

Hey all. Long time watcher, first time donater. I've lost a lot of family to cancer over the years including my aunt almost 2 years ago now and my brother in law's mom just a few weeks ago. It's not much but I had to donate to my favorite game of the last decade to be part of this amazing event. Good luck on the run Cosmic. Let's Buster Arm cancer into the dirt. "So.. devils cry huh? Let's hear what that sounds like."
I wanna see Final Fantasy!!!
Now I'm motivated!
JACKPOT! Always a pleasure to see my favorite game series played by such talented runners. Good luck on the rest of the run.

Pineapple does NOT belong on pizza. Donate if you agree/disagree!
Loving this DMC5 run so far, very informative! It shows me how much I have to learn if I go back and play it again. Much love from Arizona, let's kick cancer's butt and get that FF6 run!
I'll be asleep, but seeing what NG+ on a FF game would be a heck of a thing to watch on the VOD.
Rough time of year, but I'll do what I can to combat cancer and get that FFVI bonus run
Hooray final fantasy. Boo cancer.
RPG runs are the best part of any GDQ. Here's hoping for puwexil on the couch
Here's for all those lovely people wanting their Final Fantasy 6 run.
Got to see that final fantasy 6 run. If everybody in chat donates a dollar we can do this easy.
FF6 is a great game...and it's also great to see it broken.Here's $25 towards that.
5 dollar donation train for FFVI!! I've taken care of the first ten. You do the rest chat!
Lets start a $5 train to make FFVI happen, I know we can do it. Much love to all the runners from England.Choo Choo!
I'm a TREASURE HUNTER. There's a difference.
Let's get that ffvi incentive met. Thanks to all the speed runners, staff, volunteers, and the crowd for making such an amazing event that I look forward to watching every year!
Imma let you finish this beautiful DMC run, but five dollar hype train! Let's go FFVI!

FF6 is my favourite Final Fantasy game - I really want to see it be thoroughly broken! Let's get that incentive met!
Good luck on the run, DeCosmic, and let's see Final Fantasy 6 everybody!
Never thought I'd see a Destiny game in a GDQ. Here's one dollar for every raid I've ever finished for making my week just that much better!
Good luck everyone.
Hi Cosmic and couch! Hope you have a Cuhrayzee run.Guard Flyers assemble!
Always impressed with the runners here, thank you for putting the effort in
donating for the first time after about five years of watching GDQ just ‘cause I really wanna see that FF VI run also shout out to all the furries in the audience can I get an UwU from the audience?
I am a cancer survivor. My grandparents were not. The difference is the research completed in the last 20 years. Keep giving and let’s see how many can be saved in the next 20.
DMC, Defeat More Cancer, Honk!
This is in honor of our sister Claire, who successfully beat Leukemia. Here's to a cancer-free future. Thank you to the DMC runners and to the announcers for being so talented and engaging! Also, shout out to the crowd out there! Thanks for showing your support in person - you're all amazing!
To see a World in a Grain of Sand and a Heaven in a Wild Flower,Hold Infinity in the palm of your handAnd Eternity in uh, slightly under two and a half hour?Yeah I'm pretty sure that's how that quote went.Enjoying the run, stay stylish ya'll!
DMC5 is my favorite game of 2019, but this is the first time I'm seeing the speedrun.Pull my devil trigger.
Curing cancer HYYYYPPPPEEE
Donating for the FF6 run! Shout out to Johnny Five Aces and the SA speedfriend goons
Not sure if anyone in the audience knows this, but the most efficient way to charge Exceed is to hold the button for about half a second with each press, which charges one bar in less than two seconds. In addition, rapidly pressing the button is the most inefficient method, and it gets more inefficient the faster you press it.
Come on chat! 5 dollar donation train at 55:55 to reach the FF6 bonus game goal!
Is that man fighting with a crow and panther with tentacles?? Neat.
What is Dante's favorite bread?Devil May Rye!
It's great seeing these demons utterly demolished like how the Prevent Cancer Foundation is doing to cancer. I'm putting this towards the Final Fantasy VI bonus run. Gotta go fast Kupo!
 (Comment rejected)
It wouldn’t be a proper GDQ if we don’t get all our Bonus Games! This needs to be a 100% run! Here’s 50 bucks towards FF6.
Lets see that FF6
Had to donate for my first and favorite Final Fantasy!
When I first played DMC5 it wasn't nearly this slick, but it's just as fun to see ran as it was to play back then. Best of luck, Cosmic! Here's $15 to beckon that $5 donation train chat is summoning for that FF6 run at 55:55 (during this run)!!! Hype!
Yo again
Here's to getting that FF6 incentive met! Remember that if only 10% of the viewers donate just $5 we will meet that goal!
This is all I can do until payday tomorrow. Glad to support GDQ and Prevent Cancer any way I can.
Just want to remind everyone watching that while it's amazing we have all of these large donations coming in, the small donations still matter so much. If we didn't have our small donations, there would be so many goals we would never reach! Can we get a $20 train going?
I heard Final Fantasy VI was a possibility, so I had to donate again.After experiencing the game with voiceacting by LobosJr, I think the only way to enjoy it anymore without voiceacting is to just skip as much dialogue as possible.
Doing my part for charity and for FFVI. I believe in twitch chat.
Devil May Cry 5 is the Game i needed to donate to that, good luck for the run Cosmic and i wonder if we see that "Special Grab" on the Final Boss
Who wouldn't want more GDQ? We can see Final Fantasy and end cancer! Let's do it!
It's not much but take my money.
First time donating to GDQ! ESPER-cially happy to donate to a MOG-nificent charity. Let's GOGO with more donations to LOCKE in a TERRA-ffic Final Fantasy VI run!
Had to donate not only for that FF VI run, but for the cause as well.In the space of 10 years I lost both my parents to cancer. I hope all our donations will help others not having to go through that as well.
Gruuu....
Hopefully this donation helps get us to a Smokin' Sexy Speedy run of FF6!
Have loved watching AGDQ since first stumbling on it back in 2012. Here’s to getting FF6 on the docket as it was the first FF game I played way back in 1995.

Can we hit 1 mil before friday? Lets keep that $5 train rollin' all night long!
25 dollars for Black Eagles on the Fire Emblem Three Houses run. Long live the Empress.
We're still ahead of pace from AGDQ 2019, but we're a few hours behind from SGDQ 2019. I wonder...do we think we can make $3 million by the end of the marathon? Let's go, guys! 3 million HYPE!!!
Please let this donation fill your dark soul with LIIIIGHT!
AGDQ is always hype, so let’s make it even more exciting by meeting the FF6 donation goal! Also, honk!
Let's Get that Bonus Game also V is the Best Character look at all those adorable deadly animals!

Ff6 HYPPPPPE
The commentary and couch for the dmc run have been amazing! Let's get that ff6 run going! HYYPE!
Had to donate during this excellent DMC5 run. Just want to say, this means a lot to me because I got diagnosed with Brain Cancer last year and had a successful surgery. Let this donation go towards the runners choice!
Five dollar train at 55:55, pre-paying my ticket and that of two folks who might not be able to. I've spent hundreds of hours with FF6 over several playthroughs and would love to see it done it half an hour.
I've watched these marathons for years and am making my first donation. As someone who works in the gaming industry, it makes me proud each time these marathons happen. I've even been inspired to speed run Final Fantasy Legend II from watching Gyre on RPG Limit Break! My grandfather and my dad both have fought prostate cancer which means my turn will likely come eventually. All that being said, we're seeing FF6 no doubt about it. Come on y'all, we can't miss out on such a classic!
Let's go FF6!

Much love to the runners and staff at this amazing event. Did you know you can use your Twitch Prime sub to go towards this amazing cause?
We need to see ffvi at agdq! Get those donations in everyone

5 dollar train? 5 dollar train!! Choo chooooo
I wanna see the bonus run!Greetings from Germany
Between DMC5 and Bayonetta 2, it’s like Christmas all over again! Awesome run, Cosmic! Let’s give cancer a Pure Platinum, Smokin Sexy Stylish beat-down!
Hi AGDQ! Long time watcher, first time donating. I felt motivated to donate this year since DMC is getting some love. Nico definitely is best girl and V is best boi. Donation is going to the final fantasy run. Let's pull some devil triggers and end cancer!
Do we get to see a train flip?
The world needs a lot of love right now so lets all keep donating and supporting!
Let's get that Final Fantasy VI incentive met.
$5 train at 55:55 of Devil May Cry 5?
Choo choo
First time donating to AGDQ, here's hoping we can watch FF6!
*Kefka laugh* (optional)
Hey GDQ! Since this is the DMC 5 run, wouldn't it be appropriate to get a $5 train going? Because of course, enough fives add up to six...as in Final Fantasy 6! That's how math works just don't question it and DONATE!
1st time donating, I usually only catch the post-event replays on youtube. Really happy to catch AGDQ live this time. Let's see some FF6 and beat cancer!
Choo choo, it's 5$ donated at 55:55 for the FF VI hype train !
Last year my cousin passed away after his fight with cancer for over a year. He had randomly gained a slight limp and thanks to the early testing and checks he was given a chance to fight. He loved playing video games, And watched AGDQ every year. This whole event has a special place in my heart thanks for all the runners and staff! And thanks to the prevent cancer foundation!
donation train for FF6! let's get there! choo choo
I have watched this for years but I never had money to contribute. Finally, at long last, I can put some money where my mouth is!~ Now DMC fans with expendable cash... where's your motivation?~
$5 train at 55:55!!!
I should have been the one to fill your dark soul with - Oh wait... wrong game!Love the series and GDQ! Keep up the good work!
Let's see some FFVI.
Watching you destroy one of my favorite games from last year is an absolute treat to watch m. Keep up the fantastic work!
I'll take 3 tickets to board the $5 train. I had so much fun with this game in my first playthrough. Banger soundtrack, amazing story, super fun gameplay. Definitely my GOTY for 2019. Been waiting to see this speedrun all week and I have not been disappointed. Thanks to the great runner and great couch. Now let's get that FFVI goal met!
ChooChoo!
Always wanted to get involved in this great cause. First year getting to watch AGDQ live. The only way to make this better is to get a Final Fantasy VI run added into the mix! Come on guys! Let's do this!
Glad to see DMC getting some love at GDQ. Good luck to Cosmic and remember the hours of folly are measured by the clock, but of wisdom; no clock can measure.
Wow! Pretty Great!
[Ger] love this event, the runs and the people behind are all awesome!
55:55 train
Hey GDQ! I just got some awesome news! I got a raise at work! There is no better way to celebrate than donating some to an amazing cause. Oh and final fantasy 6. $6 hype train anyone?

Staying up late in the UK to watch this run - love this game. "Got an arm? I'm good."Best of luck Cosmic.
Love DMC. Would love some Final Fantasy VI too.
Loving this Devil May Cry run, and I have to donate for FFVI, one of my all-time favorites

For my friend
Hello, I am happy to send you some help even though I am at work at the moment, and the reason being, I have never seen final fantasy 6! Come on chat! I know that we can all do it! If everyone donated 5 bucks will be able to see basically everything this GDQ has to offer.
At SGDQ we pulled together a million dollars over a few hours just because we could. If we summon a tiny fraction of that energy, meeting the FFVI incentive should be a cakewalk. Much love and long live the GDQ spirit!
Y’all better “burn” a hole in your wallets so we can see Final Fantasy VI!!Cuz that would be “cool”.
HOOOONNNKK! Long time watcher, first time donator. To all involved especially runners and staff to take your time out to arrange such an awesome event for a righteous cause is amazing. To all my fellow watchers please continue donating to such a good cause <3
Both my grandfather and uncle are battling cancer now. Long time watcher first time donator. Love gdq and the reasons for hosting these events. Much love and lets get that ff6 run!!!
This run is pretty stylish! Cosmic is by no means dead weight!

Don't forget to specify the Final Fantasy VI Bonus Game incentive when donating, found at the bottom of the page! Also you can use your Twitch Prime free sub!
Thank you for all you do, AGDQ. Three years ago I lost my mom to cancer. She always supported my video game hobby, and so I thought it only made sense to send a little of her love your way! This donation is dedicated to her, now let's cast Ultima on cancer!
Incredible to see all the support. Let's make sure the devil cries :)
Honk for bonus games!
Cosmic probably doesn't remember me but he taught me how to play guilty gear like 5 years ago so i had to donate during his run

I love cheese as much as the next guardian, but the world deserves to see Riven at her best. Here's to fighting her legit in Destiny 2!
Nothing personnel kid.
I NEED MORE POWER
A few more fives to add to the (ghost) train. Hopefully we can see FFVI get properly suplexed.
As a broke college student, I hope this is enough. Can I get a HONK???
Demons die when they are killed...
FF6 is one of my favorite games so of course I'm donating for it.

Final Fantasy 6 hype! Keep this marathon going!
The Devil May Cry but I think TwitchChat might cry more if the FFFVI incentive isn’t met, so here’s my part! Good luck to the runners and great job to DECOSMIC so far.
If V is secretly half of Vergil, does that mean that Urizen is actually named Ergil?
Choo Choo!
Boyfriend wants ff6

In 8th grade I almost failed algebra because of Final Fantasy 6. 30 years later it feels like I made the right choice? Who even factors equations? #FF6VsAlgebra
so wait i can donate to an amazing cause and hopefully get to see one of my favorite games destroyed well thats not a hard choice FF6 HYPE!!
Don't forget to donate toward the Final Fantasy VI Bonus Game incentive near the bottom of the page before submitting so we can hit that goal. I have spoken.
Kudos to Decosmic and the couch for such an awesome run! DMC5 is the only and one GOTY. Twitch Chat! We can do it! The FFVI hype train is real and this party is just getting started! Let's rock!
Let's see that FF6 incentive met.
I was diagnosed with metastatic breast cancer in November, and am curled up on the couch with my blanket and my chemo-induced fatigue. Here's $5 for that Final Fantasy VI run, which will no doubt bring back fond memories of playing that game with my husband.
Comon' AGDQ! Let's meet this incentive for FFVI and defeat cancer while doing it. Together, we can do it!
Hot DMC5 run. Let's get this FF6!
$50 to seeing a wild FF6 run
$5 donation train for Final Fantasy VI
Put this towards FFVI, and towards making it so that we can all get a New Game Plus against cancer
Donating for Final Fantasy VI in honor of my father. He's been battling cancer for two years and SNES FF games were always special for the two of us. Seems like the right time to contribute.
FFVI!!!
6 for FF6
I'm "Searching for Friends" to help donate and make the FF6 run happen! My $50 is a chip in your pile. Ante up! Don't be a son of a submariner...
Tacos are tasty to eat during FF6 and while beating cancer.
Cheers to everyone involved with AGDQ for all the wonderful things you're doing. I'm hoping we can meet the FFVI incentive <3
Someone asked me if DMC5 is the greatest Devil May Cry of all time and I had to say no... it's the greatest ACTION GAME ever made! I guess that means yes anyway, but I really mean it. I'm really enjoying the run and felt I had to donate to spread the truth. Jackpot!

$5 donation train! GO GO GO GO!
$5 train? Better make it 5x5 to suplex that train! Donating because I SPARDA that "Run DMC" shirt you're wearing. Every time I see that name and come NERO to mistaking it for this game series before I VEEr clear away from that mistake. DANTE make that mistake like I do, though
Here's $5 for the HYPE train. Let's see some FF6!!
Can I pay the couch commentator to narrate my biopic? I'd also take an audiobook or podcast. If you're not making money off that voice then you're missing out.
Oh lawd, he chuggin'
DmC Dante is the best Dante
Damn, that guy on the couch sounds almost exactly like Markiplier!

ALL ABOARD
I have LOVED this DMC5 run! Choo-choo for the FF6 Train!
Take my moey and keep up the good work!
$5 hype train for FF6! Thank you GDQ for being my home <3
Don't mind me just on the train CHOO CHOO
In the last several years, my dad has survived battles against both colon and prostate cancer. He's healthy now thanks to work done by organizations like Prevent Cancer Foundation. Donating to help save more lives. Also, let's go FFVI!
Here's $25 toward FF6! It's not quite FF5, but it'll have to do.
Swordmaster, Gunslinger, Royal Guard, TricksterLong ago Redgrave City lived in harmony, but everything changed when Urizen attacked.Only Dante, master of all 4 styles could stop him, but when the world needed him the most he vanished.1 month later, a skinny emo kid and I rediscovered him face down in a ditch. Although his devil trigger may be strong, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone, but I believe Dante is dead weight.

Love what you guys are doing. Keep going
My father is a two-time cancer survivor so this charity is close to my heart. Donating toward FF6 because I cannot even FATHOM how that game could be completed in 35 minutes... hopefully some train suplexing will still be involved!
Final fantasy VI yes? I think so! please take my money!!
No one can suplex this $5 train

Man, a Final Fantasy 6 run DESERVES to be done, let’s get that incentive met! Good luck to all the runners and thanks for a great event.
Donating to wish myself a happy birthday, because that's totally a sane thing to do. Just a reminder that even in the year 2020, Chitoge is still best girl.
A year and a half ago I had a stem cell transplant to rid myself of Leukemia. It has been a successful treatment but not everyone is so lucky. It's also a difficult process I wish no one had to endure. Let's learn to stop cancer before it starts! Also, let's do this FF6 run. Go neerrm!
It's like they don't know what the word FINAL means... FFVI good, cancer bad!
I had a minor surgical procedure today. So, I’m just resting up tonight watching GDQ.
We are pushing it there peeps! Great run on the DMC but I never seen Final Fantasy 6 . I must see it before I forget about it's existence!Let's go fams!!!
Not only can we meet the incentive, this train is en route to ONE MILLION DOLLARS! Next stop, Final Fantasy Six!

Final Fantasy VI in 35 minutes? What?? How???
I'd like to see if FF6 has any Galarian Zapdos in the run. Hold, I think they are called Chocobos in that universe.
So basically this is Kingdom Hearts - V is Vergil's Nobody, and Urizen is his Heartless?
A Final Fantasy VI run at GDQ is mandaTerra!
Now I can't get the Chicken Dance song out of my head! Cheers to all the runners!
GG's Trio
FF6 is the first JRPG I really sank my teeth into and set off a love affair with both the series and the genre. Can’t imagine the target not being met, so let’s do this!

Whether we meet the incentive or not, we should step into a war with Riven in the Dreaming City... with a few Thousand-Layer Cakes. It is the Dawning, after all, and I bet she's a bit hungry.
Let's get this bonus game hyyyype!
FFVI let's go!
Two quick messages if it’s alright, Prolix. :)First, I’d like to give a big “Thank you!” to all AGDQ staff and the Prevent Cancer Foundation. My mother passed from cancer a few years ago, and a few months later, I discovered AGDQ and PCF for the first time. I was so glad to learn of an organization dedicated to early detection and prevention of cancer, and was amazed to see AGDQ doing such a great job raising money for them. You guys rule.Second, I’d like to give a quick shoutout to my Destiny 2 clan, Wizards Asylum, who are all watching right now! Hi Dan, Jon, Livewire, JBallz, Fatmaster, Bruiser, Airwolf, Abi, and Adapt!This money goes towards running Riven legit. You should savor your victory, o’ speedrunners mine…
Let's keep this train rolling, we're super close to meeting the FF6 incentive!
Destiny 2 has been my favorite games lately, but I want more Final Fantasy first!
Neerrm has always been a hard-working, awesome guy for the communities he's in. *door click* He's a devastatingly good Tecmo Super Bowl player, he did so, so much for Final Fantasy IV, and it's great to see him on the big stage again striking new ground in Final Fantasy VI. *door click* On behalf of the FF4 and Free Enterprise communities, thank you for all that you have done. *door click* Go Browns.
NEVER GIVE UP HOPE! FF6 LETS GO!
5$ for FF6, if everyone goes for it, it can happen!!!

Long-time watcher, first-time donator! Thank you for putting on such an awesome event, and for introducing me to awesome new games.
FF6 Hyyyype!
I wish I had more, but at least this should help.
Thanks to my boyfriend I discovered GDQ and I'm so happy the gamers community does this!! I lost several members of family to cancer and I hope we can win this fight together. Keep on being amazing!
I love GDQ. Always such a great time! Thanks for keeping the dream alive, guys.
Good luck to all runners!

Wanted to make my first donation during the Three Houses run, but this ff6 run needs to be met. Lost my grandpa to cancer several years back, and several others throughout my life. Since we're in the business of suplexing things, why not suplex cancer as well?
Oh my heroSo far away nowWill I ever see your smile?Honk!
To the people who brought one of my favorite games to the GDQ stage, thank you. And thank you to everybody who donates their time and money to slaying that dragon cancer. Let's break the donation record again and grant some ACTUAL wishes.Per Audacia Ad Astra, Guardians!
Here's to Drifter being commentator... OHHHHH CANCER OFF THE FIELD!

All three of us have lost someone to cancer over the last 15 years, so Rip and Tear cancer to make Doomguy proud!
Let's get some more Final Fantasy on the schedule!
We need FF6! Make it happen!
When I was young, I lost my grandfather to what was probably lung cancer, leaving me without any grandparents, as well he was the only family member of his generation that I got to know. So this donation goes to beating cancer and to making the Final Fantasy 6 speedrun a reality.
Choo choo, more Final Fantasy please!
Honk if you want to see some FF6
All my love to the best Destiny clan ever, Awful Squad Jr. Y'all are the raddest and sweetest people around. <3

Whether we wanted it or not, we stepped into a war with Cancer at AGDQ, so let's get to sending in our donations 1 by 1.
Final Fantasy 6 was my gateway into RPGs and I love seeing this run at GDQ. It MOGGLES my mind how good this game is.

My mom beat cancer last year. Final Fantasy VI is probably the only game on the schedule she would recognize the name of so I guess that's a good enough reason to put this towards that incentive? It's a stretch but like whatever I just want to watch some FFVI tonight, gang.

So great to finally see Destiny at GDQ! Here are some Warlock facts: - Warlocks wear art class as armor. - PC Warlocks play on a USB typewriter. - Warlocks wear Glowhoo because they are afraid of the dark. And Warlocks always save the animals.
Hurray, the FF6 incentive has been met! Have my money anyway ;p
Well dine everyone at AGDQ.. Runners, commentators, tech people, you are all heroes.
For my friend Roman, a phenomenal person and nurse who lost his life to cancer too soon.
 (Comment rejected)
With lots of love from germany.
Its my birthday and I'm giving back! Here's 50 dollars to help take cancer down a peg. I'll throw another 50 in if Riven drops One Thousand Voices in the Last Wish run.
This WAS for Final Fantasy VI, I'm not a fan of the series, but people want this so bad. Now that it's closed, I'm glad that they get to see what they've worked for. Have $25 dollars anyways! Goes towards runner's choice!
Can't wait for Destiny 2! I fell off playing, so I'm excited to see a raid I haven't done yet. Would love to see it cheesed and finished legit! Let's see that incentive met!
No cheese
Keep up the great work.
Too bad it doesn't look like we'll meet the goal for a legit run. But if we do, I request that the team use Aussie seal call outs!
FFVI !!! #LonaLink
I'm really early, but any donation for making Super Mario World harder is a good time for me!
Let's make that FF6 speed run happen!
Alright alright alright! Let’s see what we got.Donations! Bring a buck.
Been watching for years when i can, and this is the first year like many that can finally donate. I've had many losses to cancer, and scares of cancer with my parents. I hope that one day it'll be gone, but for now, lets take it down. HONK!
So glad to see that FF6 got into the marathon. Best of luck to Neerrm. Putting this to all levels in 140, mostly because I'm close to finishing that myself.
My husband loves watching AGDQ and got me into it as well. we took the week off from work to watch. HONK!
Super excited to see Destiny at AGDQ. Good luck to the runners!
So happy to see that we met the incentive for FF6! Good job and I hope everyone enjoys the run!
Let's show Destiny 2 some love too!

Had to donate during the FF6 run in honor of our 3 month old baby girl, Celes
Promis je remets pas le même commentaire mais je voulais absolument qu'on lise ma blague référencée de qualité ! Par contre je change de hashtag #DarkMage Go André, Go le vieux monsieur, Affectueusement !
Hi Tom!
Here's to FF6 and beating cancer! Thanks GDQ for all that you do!
Honk honk, it's tuba time
Destiny 2 is the best, shout out to waypoint destiny crew. Will donate 10 dollars per worldline zero physics death
DO THE RIVEN
I said I'd donate another $100 if we met FFVI when we were at like 20K with under 2 hours to go, and WOW was I not sure it would happen. GDQ brings about amazing things, so who's to say that can't include an end to cancer? I hope this year's GDQ millions goes straight to the next big breakthrough. Runner's choice!
Shoutout to @DemonSmallZ on the couch. Skies at GDQ BlessRNG
Donating to set the Fire Emblem birthday to my favorite holiday. Let's hit 1 million!
15$ train? Yes? Loving the runs, as always. HONK!
 (Comment rejected)
Let's get this one million dollar goal hit. I am in the audience and I have to go to the bathroom.
Watch gdq with my partner every year, speaking of, Jarret will you marry me?
Long time watcher first time donator. My father had passed away at my young age of 16 due to pancreatic cancer a few years back. He introduced me to Final Fantasy when I was a wee lad and I've loved it since. I'm more than happy to be one of many to donate to the cause. Keep being awesome GDQ, I love what you do
@Demonsmallz
Here's my $6, are we on WR pace to $1 million?
The Riven Legit fight is one of the coolest coordinated encounters in Destiny. Definitely something worth showing off.Need a Bungie donation train involving the lucky number 7s for this encounter. Oh, donators mine.
Nice to see my favorite Final Fantasy game return to AGDQ. But, no one should be getting dehydrated during this run Everyone should get some Setzer water to quench their thirst.
This donation is for my sister, who just recently survived a fight with cancer. As an elder millennial I'm happy to donate during Final Fantasy VI. Cheers to the runners.
Good luck on the run and dont forget, don't tease the octopus! Son of a submariner!
FF6 was the first ever game I played as a kid. Big thanks to my cousin Matt who introduced me to this amazing world. Neeram you got this. Can i get a HONK!
You can HONK if you want to. You can leave your friends behind. 'Cause if your friends don't HONK and if they don't HONK then they're, no friends of mine!
Final fantasy 6 will always go down as my favorite FF game in the entire series! When I saw y'all were going to be breaking my favorite game in the time in 30 odd minutes I had to donate for a good cause and a fun run! Break those 16 bits down!
 (Comment rejected)
Love watching every year! Good luck to the Destiny team on their Last Wish run!
Glad we weren't LOCKED out of FF6! Let's all pop open a cold SETZER water and enjoy it!

A 3 and a 6 for the two ways of numbering my favorite FF game! So glad this incentive was met. Go Army of Blonde Terras!

$5.55 for 5:55 for 1 million!
*Failsafe voice* Kill them dead! <3
The hype is here! You all are amazing! Keep it up!
Excited for the Destiny 2 run!
I just realized, that we donated 100k for a 35 minute run. But the weirdness that is FF6 NG+ is kinda worth it.Still I have to say, I am so prout being a part of this great community, that is able to raise that much money in such a short amount of time!
Donating towards Riven legit because I like looking at her “cute” little puppy face. Also, chaos ensues.
 (Comment rejected)
Fire Emblem Three Houses was my first Fire Emblem game and it was a blast! Many days were spent taking turns with my girlfriend playing through the multiple endings. Donating towards Golden Deer, Fear the Deer! Love you Carly!
Ohhhhh yeah destiny at gdq. Can't wait to see this raid destroyed
Hello AGDQ,First time donator, long time follower. thank you for all the good work you all do and thank you to the runners as well. Please use this donation towards Fighting Riven legit! because its so easy a Titan can do it! #hype #honk
The Nintendo Player's Guide to FF6 says about Terra "when she finds the frozen Esper, her world takes a strange twist..." I don't think this is what they meant.
So excited to see Destiny 2 at a GDQ, and especially to see Cammycakes and Datto commentating. Shoutout to my clan, Crime Team, and the LGBT Destiny community. Let's get the legit Riven fight incentive!
long time watcher first time donating. I wish all the destiny runners the best of luck. my donation goes to the drifter for the commentator.
So excited for the Three Houses run. Here's another donation to see my Golden boys and girls on the big screen!
I love GDQ and am happy to be able to contribute again this year. Show Riven who's boss!
Bourrez les dons, hommage à tous les commentateurs et particulèrement au vieux monsieur pour FF3 qui est en fait le 6 #MarioLight
Glad to see FF6, hope to see everyone dancing mad
You guys are awesome. This is a great cause; I'm donating in honor of my dad who battled with cancer up until a couple years ago and LOVED the Super Nintendo - he'd probably be watching AGDQ too if he was still with us.
Terror Baltimore
Donating to watch my face FF VI get destroyed in such new interesting ways!
Thank you for your efforts and thank you to the runners for the awesome runs so far! *choo choo*
I know how committed to legit Riven runs Datto is, do it for Datto!!
Loving the FF6 bonus run! My favorite Final Fantasy growing up. Keep being awesome GDQ!
ALL HAIL THE DEMON CHOCOBO! LONG MAY HE REIGN! OUR LORD AND SAVIOR LIVES NOW AND FOREVER.
Great to see yet another way to break one of the best RPGs ever, The Adventure of Terra and the Terras!... er... FF Six!
I wish we could see the opera with all these clones! Terra, Tinas, and the &&& girls
We only just barely snuck FF6 into the marathon, let's get a headstart on the Pokemon Blue TAS incentive to make sure we have a full TAS block for tomorrow!
All hail the Demon Chocobo!
I’ll give $10 more if someone on stream can sing me a good Final Fantasy victory jingle!
Time to make chicken nuggets out of the demon chocobo.
I'm sad we don't get to hear the best opera ever, but this bonus run is fantastic. I'm looking forward to seeing the end for the first time.
ALL HAIL OUR LORD DEMON CHOCOBO!(Donation to runner's choice.)
Hi all, Ninjaura here, long time watcher, donator, Destiny lover and hopeful Destiny story speedrunner, I just want one quick thing: can I get some hype from the crowd for the tech people at this event?? None of this would be possible without them, and they definitely deserve some hype for the amazing job they're doing!! Donating for the Destiny 2 lootcrate prize and some a legit Riven fight!! Good luck, see you starside, and eyes up Guardians!
This FF6 run is insane! I don't thino I'll ever understand how it's even possible to figure out how to reprogram a game by playing it, but I always love seeing it done!
FF6 is my all time favorite game that I've played many times... but never like this!!
We're still so far away from meeting that Destiny 2 Legit Riven incentive! It's a true display of skill and it'd be a shame to not see it.
I'm glad that I have the chance to donate this year. Over the last couple years, I've had family diagnosed with cancer, but so far they have fought on, and in a couple cases, beat it. Here's to bringing an end to cancer.
Huh. It took me over 10 hours to beat this game. I must have been doing something wrong...
Second of 2 planned donations. How much do we have to give to be free of Demon Chocobo.
Congrats Neerrm on the awesome run!!!Petition to officially change his name to "Ampersabin."Thanks again to all the speed-runners and AGDQ for another amazing year helping out the best causes. Peace and love to you all!
Son of a submariner! I love FF6
GDQ, You're nearly there! Fill that bank up!
I'm proud of you. Keep up the good work.
only a little over 25K to go when I'm donating. 1 Million Hype!
Shout out to the NERF Squad Turbo Raptors. fmgSHAKE
Just wanted to thank the Runners, Volunteers, and Staff for making AGDQ possible. I lost my uncle 6 years ago to Lung Cancer just before Christmas and just recently found out my brother may also have Cancer. Thank you again for everything you great people do! Donation to Runners Choice.
Merci à tous de commenter du Speedrun pour la recherche contre le cancer!C'est bon pour toute la communauté geek!Merci à toi vieux monsieur (MV)! #CoeurNoir
(In Kefka's voice)SON OF A SUBMARINER! You just had to do it didn't you? You met the incentive! The way you were rallying, you all sounded like a SELF-HELP BOOKLET! I've got donations in my boots from how much money you're throwing around! Wait... what are you doing?! TERRA WHAT ARE YOU DOING?! You fools!! I hate, hate, HATE you! I was supposed to destroy the world, NOT HER! Stop stealing my spotlight!
I haven't caught any runs live this year, but I am excited for the Fire Emblem run tonight. I don't quite understand all the names being thrown around, as we should really be calling the protaganist by the one true name of all Fire Emblem main characters, Marth.
Found out this morning my Grandmother just passed away from lung cancer. But don't let that upset you she would want everyone to be as happy as possible and enjoy life to the fullest. The Final Fantasy series has been and will always be my go-to escape from reality and glad to always see GDQ speedrunning the series every year!
Had to donate during Final Fantasy VI. Thank you for this amazing event and lets Suplex cancer!
I love FFVI I've never caught a shorter run like this before. Glad to donate while it's still on.
A little donation before I head to bed. Its unfortunate that I need sleep to survive or I would be watching AGDQ all week straight through.A BIG thank you to the behind the scenes crew that keep this event running.
First time I got to catch AGDQ while it was going on. Happy to be able to donate to a great cause. Cancer has affected a lot of my family, so here's hoping we can kick it's butt! Money toward Golden Deer house for Fire Emblem: Three Houses!
Saying hi to my brother, Ryan at home who is also watching this while I’m at work. Hope he donates to say “Hi” too.
*Please read during Destiny 2* Hey Datto, just like last year here is my $24.02 reference. Shout out to you, Danielle, and Jez for the memes and guides. Here's to a hopeful world first raid someday!
Failsafe is too precious to not include here.
Wasn't going to donate today, but I had to support the Blue Lions, even if it's a futile cause. Good Luck Claris! Thanks staff!
Hey there GDQ! Very excited to see one of my favorite games at the event! Good luck to the team! Really excited to see Datto commentating as well :)Been watching and donating every event for the past 3 years and every time the events just keep getting better. Keep up the good work and 1 million hyyyype?!
Thank you for the good work guys =) Keep going <3
Greetings from Austria!AGDQ wrecks my sleep cycle once again... but who could pass up on watching FF6? <3also: HONK!!!
Toss some gil to your runners, kupo! Let’s start at $5 train!

C-mon everyone, lets do this riven fight clean and legit. It is a spectacle that you don't get to see very often. $5 train to get this?
Can't believe that FF6 run exists and is marathon safe. Coolest run I've seen in my 7 years of GDQ viewing!
Alright alright alright. Let's see what we got.Drifter as commentator? Sounds good.
First time donating. Lost my Dad to cancer a few months ago, so here's hoping we can all conquer the disease as soon as possible. Donation goes toward the Black Eagles for house incentive, because deep down, we're all Ferdinand Von Aegir.
Right at the end of that amazing FF6 run, I hatched a shiny Mimikyu in pokemon shield, so I just had to donate!
This donation is on behalf of my mom, who lost her battle with lung cancer, last week. Keep up the good work everyone and let's end cancer.
This run was a joy to watch - I had no idea you could break FF6 so badly.
Destiny is one of my personal favorite games. Let's make the our Last Wish to cure cancer. Donation goes toward actually seeing the final encounter beat the way developers intended - without cheese.
HONK!

Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cancer at AGDQ. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'caner. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Humanity
Eagles > Deer. It's just science.

Watching this FFIV run is like being lost in a wild fever dream. Everyone is Terra, but not actually Terra, warping around without rhyme or reason, and tormented by a bizarre demonic chocobo. Props to the runners for their surreal questioning of the nature of reality.Donation to commentators choice of incentive.
I can’t believe I get to see a Last Wish run on my birthday!! Thank you runners and AGDQ for such a wonderful event!
It simply was my Destiny, 2 donate right now!
<3 GDQ
I have no idea what happend at that FF6 run, but it was amazing!
One million on Thrusday? Let's go.
Excited to stay up way past my bedtime for the Fire Emblem Three Houses run! Save the animals, I mean the Black Eagles.
Good luck to the Destiny 2 runners

Donating for that Ike print; have GOT to have a print of the BEST FE main character. Yeah I said it.
Had to get my donation in during this historic Last Wish speedrun. I'm thrilled to no end to see this game repped at AGDQ! Good luck to those guardians speedrunning to slay Riven and cancer! Remember Guardians make their own fate.
Very excited to watch the first Destiny 2 GDQ run and it's with the best raid! <3
Had to donate this during the Destiny 2 run for my good buddy and Destiny fire team leader Wala who lost the fight with cancer in 2016. He would be blown away by how large both Destiny and GDQ have become. Keep up the fight and HONK!
Lets get riven done legit >:)
Can't give too much, but I'm giving every time.
I have been there since the beginning of Destiny. Through all the good and bad times. Happy to see a speedrun of a raid at GDQ. I will donate an extra 25 on each encounter if the team does not wipe during that encounter. I will also donate another 500 at the end of the raid if the fireteam goes flawless. Show GDQ your Light Guardians!(If possible read this before the run happens)
Super excited for the upcoming Three Houses run - donation goes to the best house, Black Eagles.
Awwwwwwwwwww #keizandfeas
My sleep schedule always gets messed up during GDQ weeks, but who cares! It's for charity! I can always sleep all day once the week is over. But I hope the attendees, staff, and runners make sure to get some rest this week!
I've been watching the stream since Sunday, and I finally decided to donate since cancer is common in my family. Here's a $20 donation to help eradicate cancer!
The video games were the friends we made along the way.

Never ran my runs on the stage on my own. Never played my games wishing they would be heard. I saw you raising money to unlock final fantasy. You were always there fighting cancer in this speedy marathon.
Thank you for all of the runners to helping to kill cancer. Donating to the golden deer house because "Hilda! Hilda! Hilda!" also greetings from Minnesota
For generations, the Dreaming City housed one of the Awoken's most closely guarded secrets. She is known as Riven — Riven of a Thousand Voices. The last known Ahamkara. She has been Taken. And her death is your calling.
No comment this time, just chilling around with today's donation. Shoutouts to FicusVegeta, I guess. Good marathon so far
What's Riven's favorite beverage? A Shuro Chai LatteGood luck to Datto and the rest of the runners on the Last Wish run!
Had to donate during one of my favorite games ever! Good luck O Speedrunners Mine! I'm putting this toward legit Riven.Also, shout-out to Awful Squad Jr, Space Idiots, and the entire LGBT Destiny community.
c'mon golden deer, let's do our thing and show cancer why they should FEAR THE DEER!!!
So happy to see Destiny at GDQ!
Don't give Riven cheese, its not good for her!
Lets make it to $1 million before midnight.
GET IT!!!
Isn't platforming wonderful? I'll triple this donation if we can start a "platforming" chant!
destiny at GDQ?? I CAN'T BELIEVE WHAT I'M SEEING!!! good luck on the run, o speedrunners mine!
Shout out to Sent, the best prizeman, and only prizeman in my heart!
Destiny is a franchise that brings friends together, unites people to solve puzzles and beat monsters. We've slayed gods, conquered time, and bent fate to our design. From firing Gjallarhorn at Aetheon in the Vault of Glass to "Bob the Builder"-ing in the Black Garden, Guardians have shown that we will come together to overcome insurmountable odds. So hold on to your Dinklebots we're gonna take cancer to the Crucible. Guardians make their own fate!
Let's get a legit Riven run!

Bring the sky down upon them Guardians! So happy to see Destiny at GDQ!
Double dragon here! Watching from the couch in lion track suits! Live long and prosper!
Errybody go for it. Try to save one frame for every dollar raised. Surely that's viable.
Absolutely stoked to see Destiny 2 get featured at a GDQ. Donating to see a legit Riven fight. Eyes up guardians and get hyped!
love all <3 <3 <3
July 26th was the US release date and also my birthday, would love to see it on the big stage!
Treat riven with love and respect. Say no to cheese! Good luck on the run!
Thanks to all the kind attendees at AGDQ enjoying my music!
Destiny's Last Wish soundtrack is my favorite for the whole game, and Riven's music in particular is the best out of that. Let's get the legit Riven incentive met so we can hear it for more than 30 seconds.
merci d'accompagner mes nuits et mes jours, et de permettre tout ca. Bravo à vous, un jours ces effort seront récompensé, et nous mèneront vers un monde sans cancer
Hope to see one of the runners get 1000 Voices since I haven't had good luck getting it myself!
This AGDQ has been an amazing experience, and I wouldn't have it any other way. Good luck to all the upcoming runners, and let's Prevent Cancer!
Ayyy Bobboh! Get em boys!
Gotta do it for dimitri, but I put my incentive to black eagles
So excited for tge second season of th Keiz and Feas Show! And Prize showed off those sents so well! Can't wait to see the D2 Last Wish run! I've never beaten the Raid myself, so I can't wait to see it get broken!
I lost my grandfather 9 years ago to stage 4 liver and pancreatic cancer. Once he was diagnosed our family lost him a week later, I still remember what he told me and it still rings in my head. He told me he knew I was destined to do great things and that he was always going to be proud of my choices in life. This goes to doing the Riven fight legit, and as always runners, thats optimal dps! Lets end cancer and stop they pain it brings people.
So excited to see Destiny featured!
The Spyro print did it for me! This is my first time donating, though my husband and I will donate again when our favorite speed runner, Andy, is up later this weekend.
Shout out to all the staff and runners, you all make this event really special. I look forward to it every year. I really appreciate all you do. Keep changing the world one run at a time!!
Shoutout to the CGR. I pull first lever.
Congratulations on 10 years! Let's hit 1 million.
Hey Gamers!
Down about 1.000.000 in student, loans so what is another 20?
I've never beaten Riven so I am looking forward to watching them destroy Riven and make one Last Wish to defeat cancer!
Please, do not forget give Riven a cookie!!!!!!!!!!!!
I saw Daddy Datto and I had to donate for the Last Wish Raid run. Good luck on the run and remember what Cayde-6 said "I don't have time to explain what I don't have time to understand!"
One of my best friends passed away this summer. He introduced me to the Destiny franchise, and we made priceless memories thanks to the games. The last thing we did together was earn our first Destiny raid jackets-- I'm going to treasure that jacket forever. He would have been ecstatic to see Destiny at a GDQ, I wish he could watch. Let's beat cancer so more people get a continue!
:) My mother just got the all clear from cancer, hope this donation can help others as well!

Love Destiny 2 and happy to donate to the cause!
A hot dog is absolutely a sandwich. No question.
Hey, GDQ! Congratulations on ten years of doing amazing things! ♥️
Last Wish hype!
Howdy Shock, Alexy, Packle, Kirk, Tokeegee and Milk!So happy to be a part of this amazing speedrunning community with you guys and I am super happy to see this run in the GDQ with all the hype surrounding it! Good luck with your run to the six of you, AND LETS KICK CANCER'S BUTT!
AGDQ is all about going fast, but I think it would be nice to slooooow down for once. Fight Riven like a real fireteam and show everyone who the real boss is!
Oh no no no, you're totally fighting Riven without cheesing it. Everyone needs to the real fight!
You have my thanks Guardians, but my sister remains enthralled. Without Shuro-Chi, we cannot defeat cancer. Find her. SAVE her. And know this: Riven will try to seduce you. When she speaks, Do. Not. Listen.
I always look forward to GDQ and I'm so glad that I am able to donate every time it comes around. Donating to Three House's best girl Edelgard
It's my favorite gaming event all year! Proud to watch this event grow and change over the last several years, and hope we have many years to come! Thank you to the runners and the organization for putting this together.

What is this warlock nonsense, everyone knows that hammer bro’s are the real way to go! That aside, Destiny’s raids are beautiful, so let’s enjoy the show!
Hey GDQ! First time donating, been watching for 5 years now! Love seeing Destiny at a GDQ for the first time. Love what you do here. Lost my Aunt Ellen and Marlene to cancer, and my Uncle Randy is currently kicking throat cancer's butt! Put this towards Riven Legit.
Its amazing to finally see my favorite game of all time Destiny 2 finally on GDQ! Here's $25 to see the legit riven fight!
You just never quit, do you. Took out Ghaul. Woke up the Traveler. And now half of what I hear on the streets is how much you and your clan are making a difference at AGDQ 2020. Good luck on the Last Wish run. Eyes up Guardians.

Great to see a Destiny raid speedrun at AGDQ! Here's a hundred dollars towards fighting the giant space dragon the *legit* way. Oh, and fighting against cancer. That's a cause I think we can all get behind, o speedrunners mine.
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Destiny is my youngest brother’s favorite game and the whole family is here watching the AGDQ premier with him. Good luck runners!
I dunno what made me awww harder. The pupperz? The pretty consoles? Holding Guy Fieri close to the heart? The boos? The Goose stealing all the cups? I came to laugh, not to feel.
This is my 3rd year donating in a row and I had to do so on one of my favorite games! I’d love to see more of Destiny in future GDQs but whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
I'm starting a new job in a cancer research lab in 5 weeks so I guess this is a head start! Shout out to my Destiny 2 clan, raid mom loves you very much. Best of luck, O runners mine.
Destiny has been one of my favorite games since day 1 and I've easily sunk more hours into it than any other game. I knew I had to donate during the run when I heard it making its GDQ premier. Thanks so much for repping the community. Putting my donation towards doing Riven legit.
Put this towards the Fire Emblem: Three Houses route incentive! Had to throw my boy Dimitri a bone since he's losing. Good luck to Claris, and big thanks to the GDQ staff and runners for another great year!
Destiny 2 is my favorite game and Last Wish is my favorite raid. Good luck to the fireteam! Maybe if you beat it fast enough we’ll find the 15th wish.Happy to support this great cause! Keep it going AGDQ!Cheers! *SHAXX YELL* THIS IS AMAZINGPTibz
Last Wish was my introduction to raiding, so excited for it to be showcased at AGDQ!

Always glad to help a good cause and D2 is just a small cherry on top.
Glad to see the Destiny at AGDQ! I love how the Destiny community always continues to participate in events that benefit the world. I'm putting my money towards fighting Riven legit, just so everyone can actually witness it!
alright alright alright lets see what we've got speedrunners, bring a sword!
This is because of flippy hat person in the front row. Keep up the flippy hat
Let's banish cancer to the dark corners of time. Guardians make their own fate. Good luck on the Destiny run, o speedrunners mine!

Hyped for destiny! It's the bestiny! Better than all the restiny!
First time watching AGDQ live and loving all the runs! Got to say, sometimes when I'm feeling down, it's great to come back home and just get lost in games. It's exactly the pick-me-up I need.Also, super stoked for FE3Hs! Not sure I could choose between the houses. They all bring such a different story to the game. Love them all!

Super excited for Destiny! Had to donate with this run and to celebrate my mom being cancer free for 12 years
Thanks for running my favorite game, Destiny 2! Can't wait to see them destroy this raid in under an hour. Eyes up guardian.
Can you tell Pop to wake up on time tomorrow for runs.
Donating towards fighting cancer and for the Black Eagles. Edelgard was right. Down with Crests. Down with Cancer.

"Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with Cancer on Earth. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one!!!!"Love seeing Destiny playing this year at ADGQ, good luck to the runners and have fun everyone!!!!
I've been watching GDQ for years but I've never watched live and had a chance to donate. I finally have a chance to make a contribution to a cause that affects so many people. Im hoping that my small effort will make a difference.Remember... The Light lives in all places... In all things... you can block it... even try to trap it... but the Light always finds it's way. Lets go Guardians!
Love me some Destiny, love me some charitable causes. Do it for Cayde, Guardians!
Been playing Destiny since the Beta. Absolutely have to donate this year during my favourite game in honour of my Mum's partner who passed away from cancer just before Christmas after a 19 month battle. Thank you to GDQ for all the amazing things you do and all the money you raise.
If you feel you are not ready yet, guardian. Perhaps a round of Crucible shall prove to be an adequate warmup.
On behalf of all Guardians, this is for those whose Light we’ve lost to cancer. Best of luck to the fire team!
Break the curse guardians
Let's end Riven and end cancer. Guardians are the savior's of humanity.
Legit riven is insane! Please make possible people!
I've got 30 clears of Last Wish and nothing to show for it. Nada. If one of you gets One Thousand Voices at the end of this run, I'll donate another $10. Shoutouts to all my buds in Exo Stranger Danger.
HONK!
1 milly hype
Destiny player since D1 alpha, glad to finally see Destiny at GDQ, and with a historic run at that. Shout out to any Chaz Cat Clan members watching! Good luck, oh runners mine.
Eyes Up Guardians! You got this!
I had an amazing time with Fire Emblem: Three Houses - so here's to seeing my Black Eagles get it done on the battlefield!
I've been watching GDQ for the past 6 years and twice a year it's the highlight of my week. It's amazing how much good we can do when we come together because of video games. Love all that you do and keep up the AWESOME work!
Blague sur mon carambar : Que disent deux serpents qui se rencontre ?Quelle heure reptile ! Désolé pour ça, Sinon bonne AGDQ à tous enjoy les speedrun et buvez pas trop de café ! #GDQup
Thrilled to see Destiny at GDQ, a game that brought my friends and I even closer together. Even happier to see OUR BOY DATTO! #MOONSHAUNTED
Big thanks to all the runners and those involved in the event each year!
Good luck to my boys Shockwve and Packle, and shoutouts to my boys Biglaw and Mildew in the crowd.

Riven is sick with a tummyache :(
Little brother was diagnosed with a form of sarcoma 10 years ago. He won his battle with cancer but lost part of his leg in the process. He was the person that introduced me to destiny. And now I'm hooked on it ever since.
My grandson tells me you're going to catch the Last Fish! Very exciting, can't wait to see how it goes.
Games done quack ! 🦆
HONK HONK HYPE!
With well over a thousand hours in Destiny 2 and thousands of hours in Destiny 1 I am so happy to finally see it represented at AGDQ.Hope my boy Datto and Math Class can get it done flawless.Eyes up guardian!
Guardians, what you do today goes beyond simply protecting the City. Your pooling your light for this event is proof of what a fireteam can do when they come together. A Darkness such as cancer can't so much as stand in its wake.But whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon.

Thank you AGDQ for all you do! Long time watcher since 2012, second time donator. Thank you for all the wonderful groans you produce from my roommates when I stream you guys 24/7 during this wonderful event!

I wanna dedicate this speed run to my cousin, Mike. He’s a big Destiny fan and PC gamer! Unfortunately, he and his siblings lost their mother a few years ago due to cancer. If you do make a shout out, I wanna tell Mike, Andrew, and Princess that I love them, and I know that their Mom is proud of them. She taught us not to give up and keep on fighting when life throws those curve balls at us. Thank you, AGDQ.
from russian Destiny 2 community with love
Glad to see a Destiny 2 raid featured at AGDQ! Eyes up, Guardians!

Yes! Let's go Guardians!!!Also, $1 MIL HYPE!
My best friend and fireteam member suddenly returned to the light in October. She would have been just as excited as I am to watch this historic speedrun go down. So here I am, donating in her name--Krysalis-04. Thanatonaut. Voidlock. Best friend. Eyes up, Guardians. Kill Riven. Kill cancer.
Eyes up guardian! Love the support to fight cancer.
I'm so excited to see a Destiny raid played at AGDQ. The Destiny community has been a huge part of my life for the past 5 years and I'm excited for everyone at GDQ to see the work we do to optimize the game
Hi all! I’ll donate another $25 if Datto proclaims “The Stag”
Yeah, I entered the cheat code at the Wall of Wishes to give Riven her Thousand Layer Cookies. #NoShame
Greeting from Australia. Had to donate during Destiny as it's the game i've put the most time into myself all the way back since the Beta of Destiny 1. Good luck guardians.
Whether we wanted it or not, here's one dollar for each run, on average, it takes to get 1KV.
Techliner here, wanted to say hi to the crew and my gf Alexy. Speedrunning is an amazing thing and the charity makes it even better. Keep up the great work and if everyone can call Alexy cute I will donate another $25
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
Datto Does Optimal Donations Per Second
Hello all! I've never been able to donate before and now I finally have means. I lost my mum back in 2014 to Brain Cancer and Destiny has been instrumental in keeping me up when things weren't great. Datto's been one of my favorite content creators on all of YouTube and I've used his guides on various Destiny content for years so I'm really glad to see him on the couch. I want this donation to go toward doing Riven Legit because I know it's what the man himself wants. Heres to Destiny and to my Mum for letting me playing games. I'll donate again if anyone gets an Exotic throughout the run!
First time donating at AGDQ. Here's to doing Riven legit! Glad to see my favourite game on stream!
hi Bungie. Destiny dad with 10,000 kids here. I'm excited to see Last Wish finished in 45 minutes, because that's all the time I get to play Destiny in a given decade. please nerf fusion rifles and delete Eververse
I just wanted to pay my respects to the speed running and Destiny communities.
1 million HYPE!
Let's get to one million and let's get to MORE TASBOT

For my Destiny family. "And I said maybeeee" <(if you sing this I'll donate 50 more) to J, Sara, Kim, and Ocie

Donating for the Golden Deer. The Black Eagles may have all the hotties.The Blue Lions may have all the toughies.But the Golden Deer have all the personality and heart! Fear the Deer.
I've gone through Last Wish many times (gotta get that Thousand Voices, friends), but I've never actually done Riven legit. Let's see it, Guardians.
Donating for Blue Lions. Speed every last run of them!
The Last Wish raid?! I know this group can do it. Remember, I tell everyone you're my favorite guardian.
Beat the raid quickly and claim your prize, o runners mine
Greetings from the U.K. Guardians, I'd tell you how much I've been looking forward this run- but I don't have time to explain why I don't have time to explain.
As a longtime fan and supporter of GDQ and as a tester at Bungie, I've been looking forward to this run for months! Best of luck, O Runners Mine!
Love destiny 2, one of my favorite game series, Kill this raid and 1 million hype!! Honk
I have thousands of hours in both Destiny games, starting back with the D1 Beta. It makes me so happy to finally see one of my favorite series get some recognition at AGDQ.Also Datto, remind me again, what's the team DPS of the Sleeper Simulant?

So hyped to finally see Destiny on AGDQ! Let's get this bread!!!
First Time Donating, 6 year Supporter! I am doing this for the GuardianCon Squad! For CAYDE! For Bungie! For Destiny! BANG! BANG! BANG! HUNTER GANG BABY!
Did someone remember to bring cookies for Riven? Hoping for a great run, hopefully with a legit kill in the end. Wardcliff the eyes you cowards!
Love me some GDQ and gaming for a good cause. Good luck on the Destiny run and shoutout to all my HUNTER BOIIIIIIIIIS
Excited to see D2 on GDQ. Great game. Greater cause.
So happy to see my favorite game of all time on AGDQ. Good work, Guardians. Your light is strong, HONK!
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate. Also, posture check!
Much love from your bread based community manager. Cheers to this community, and gaming overall. Thank you to AGDQ for doing this every year!!
My husband and I always look forward to GDQ events, and this one is especially meaningful as our cat was diagnosed with terminal cancer this week. Thanks to all the runners, announcers, behind the scenes people, and the crowd for making this a great event, and to all the donors for helping to make cancer a thing of the past!
First time donating and I couldn't be more happy to donate during my all time favoirte game. Especially during my favorite Raid! Shout out to my boy Drum_Adillo! Can I get some hype from my Hunter Mains???
Thank you so much to everyone! The staff, runners, volunteers, all of you!I'll put my donation to the Black Eagles. That's the house I'm in after all and Edelgard is um.. really incredible. Ah either way, I'll happily donate to support this cause!
Best of luck to the best of the Destiny Community, stomp that wish dragon guardians!
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with cancer at Agdq. So let's get to saving lives, one by one.
LET'S GET TO A MILLION AND BEYOND! HONK
In Destiny, the Dawning is a time of giving and fellowship. Similarly, GDQ is a time to give to those in need. $20 against cancer, and another $25 if the team gives a cookie to Riven at the end of the raid, in true Dawning fashion
Dread it, run from it, "Destiny" arrives all the same. And now, it's here. Or should I say, I am.
42$ more if the runners can say what gods last words were in the hitch hikers guide series
Good luck to all the runners! Don’t just aim to win. Aim to kick their teeth in.
Destiny HYPE!!!!!!!!!
Let's do this...Destiny has such great raids.
Let's hit that one million! It is our... Destiny.
Was gonna vote for Black Eagles to avoid spoilers on my playthrough, but hey. Here’s to my favorite house, the Golden Deer! Let’s hit that 1 million!!!
Good luck on the run, O Murderer Mine.
Destiny is the best
In Honor of Datto and Math Class' first Last Wish clear. Crazy to see the run appear at AGDQ, I absolutely love the aesthetic and encounter design in this raid. As a veteran player and a longtime GDQ viewer, I could not be more pleased!
1 million dollars, here we come! Let's make cancer history.
AGDQ is the coolest and prevent cancer foundation is the coolest!
I love you guys! Thanks everything! Attila from Hungary

Whether we wanted it or not, we've.... stepped into a raid with a wish dragon. Pumped to see some destiny 2 here at AGDQ. If someone gives a cookie to Riven, I will donate another $100
Long time watcher, first time donater. Super excited to see Destiny 2 at this event, and super excited to see this raid destroyed. PS, hello to my fireteam, you guys better at least match my donation
 (Comment rejected)
Destiny 2 was a huge source of comfort for me while i fought my own battle with Cancer, so it feels right to donate during the Last Wish run. I've been Cancer free for 6 months and if I can do it so can you. Eyes Up Guardians, were winning this fight.
Love the content! Came across GDQ on YouTube a few weeks back. Glad to be able to participate this time live!
Hey all! Wasn't expecting destiny 2... HYPE!
Eyes up, Guardians.

Had to donate during the Destiny 2 run, you guys are doing so much for the community. Also, why aren't you guys using Tigerspite ? It's the best gun, right Cammy ?

Long time watcher, first time donator. I couldn’t believe Destiny made it to GDQ. Been playing Destiny since the beta and had to donate to one of my favorite games ever. Best of luck to the runners. Eyes up, Guardians.
"Oh my. This is... this is beautiful. You continue to be my greatest success, Guardian."-Lord Shaxx
Eyes up guardians!Whether we wanted it or not, we’ve stepped into a war with a giant wish dragon. Go kill her legit!
Love all that you do
I'm sorry but I had to do it Datto.Donation goes towards not cheesing Riven, because I'm pretty sure most of even the Destiny community doesn't know how to do it correctly.
Eyes up Guardians! Good luck, and whether we wanted it or not...;)
Leaving soon for work but glad I get to watch GDQ with my wife before then, hey Samara I love you!
Absolutely love this event. Last year, my mom was diagnosed with Breast cancer. As of 2 months ago she's cancer free. Here's $10 for each one of her kids who are grateful for events just like this. Shoutout to my Destiny Clan Susynct! Good luck on the run, boys!
$1 million HYPE!!!
I just lost my grandpa to lung cancer. It has been hard, but there is nothing like AGDQ to bring us all together for an amazing cause. This has always been my favorite time of the year. Lets all do what we can to kick cancers butt. Lets go Destiny 2. Love you all.
*drifter voice* alright alright alright alright alright alright alright alright
Your move, exo strangers.
Long time watcher, first time donator. So awesome to see all these people, runners and viewers alike, coming together to fight cancer. Donation to Black Eagles for the FE: Three Houses run. Edelgard Hype!
Long time watcher, first time donor! So glad to be able to help out such an amazing cause!
I've watched and been impressed with the skills and generosity of AGDQ for years, though I've never been able to donate due to unfortunate financial timing, and always had to watch the recordings. As someone who fell in love with the world of Destiny six years ago, I'm surprised and excited to see it turn up as an actual speedrun event! I already know some of our community's finest raiders are truly phenomenal talents, so we're in for a show. Sadly I've not had an active enough clan in the second game to do more than the first Raid, but I've heard of this and know exactly which wish I want to see! My donation goes to Failsafe because she is a precious and wonderful AI. Sorry, brotha', love gambit, but maybe next time Drifter. ...at least that's what I would say, but she's got it on lock. So here's to the uphill battle for an uphill Riven battle! Show us how it's done!
Cancer has affected many people in my family, and claimed more than it should. Shout out to to the people we don't know about making everything work behind the scenes, you people work magic year after year and are the best that the gaming community has.

So what’s the strategy for the final boss, unplug your Ethernet cable or puss the boss off the map? Either way, eyes up guardian.
Today is my birthday and every year for my birthday I donate. This year I'm asking for a gift from the viewers. LETS GET A $5 DONATION TRAIN GOING DURING THIS AWESOME DESTINY 2 RACE!!!!!!!! Can the donation go to winning team's choice?
Love Destiny and Destiny 2. Love Speedrunning. Also shout to everybody in raid secrets subreddit they deserve respect.
Hunters for LIFE! Honk!
Great to see Destiny at AGDQ!!
Justice for Camella! The combat systems gameplay team at Bungie wishes all these raiders and casters a fruitful raid! Hopefully you guys come in two minutes too late for MAX MEMES.
Destiny has eaten far too much of my time. Hopefully it will take less of your time. And of course we all know Riven is lactose intolerant. (Donation to riven legit)
I, and all the Destiny 2 community will be so annoyed if you don't feed Riven some cookies. Also greetings from Finland and from ANRA.
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the... I'm just kidding. I've been a huge destiny fan ever since the destiny 1 beta and I've been looking forward to this run all week. Good luck and eyes up guardians.
1 mil HYPE
A shame my personal favorite class: Blue Lions is dead last in the bid war. At least I can support the name Professor Snape! I will enjoy watching a Fire Emblem speed-run live for the first time.
I'm excited to be able to donate during GDQ again! I also want to say Happy Birthday to my friend Fridge, I hope his night is as amazing as he is.
Always wanted to donate. Gdq has provided me with so many hours of entertainment. I’m happy to help. Shout out to team sweet potato
Thanks to the runners and staff for your work on this event.
benefits runners choice
Love what you all are doing to fight cancer. Every little bit counts no matter how big or small.
destiny is my favorite game series! hello to everyone and fantastic commentary!
Punch Riven right in her Taken face
 (Comment rejected)
Had to donate for Claude and his crew to be chosen. Go golden Deer. Let's set cancer to permadeath and get rid of it for good!
Destiny is one of my favorite games, and I am very excited to see it run at this amazing event! When I learned that the Last Wish raid was being run, I knew I had to donate during this block. One thing that may not have been mentioned yet about Destiny is that whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one.
I love Fire Emblem, but I have to sleep during the run, so I need to say this with an early donation: Blue Lions forever!
Had to donate during my game, I'll donate 5 more for every word you can think of that rhymes with jotunn.
My Grandfather passed away August 23rd, 2017 from Multiple Mylloma (cancer of the Bone Marrow) Shockwve, you have gotten me through tough times throughout all of high school, through both borderlands 2 runs and Destiny 2, to come and know you as a friend. This is all the money i got from my grandmother for Christmas. She would approve of me putting it towards a charity for cancer prevention that is being funded by the love of Video Games.#BalancedGlide
One MILLLLLLLLLION DOLLARS!
Greetings from within the Bungie office! AGDQ has been in the corner of many monitors this week. Watching the community dominate is a highlight of this job. Good luck runners!
Love Destiny, Love GDQ, Hate Cancer
For the Light and preservation of humanity!
Gonna go for that Destiny box! I love this game and spend waaaay too much time on it.
 (Comment rejected)
Awesome seeing you all here at AGDQ! I've never been in a good enough place financially to donate, but I can do so now so I figured this would be an amazing opportunity. Here's to a flawless raid and to a game that has "taken" my heart.
 (Comment rejected)
Had to donate during the Destiny 2 raid run. Eyes up Guardians! Donation is going to making sure that during the Fire Emblem Three Houses run the protagonist has the most noble name of Von Aegir.
Much love to all the guardians out there!
Thanks for everything you do
Loving Datto's commentary, couldn't have picked a better couch for this Last Wish run. Donation goes towards a legit Riven fight - talk about complicated mechanics. Also, honk for $1 million!
This is for my friend Andy who I met here on twitch that battles cancer every day. To him and everyone else out there fighting against cancer, stay strong and keep fighting!Heck you cancer!
Always a great event to watch and enjoy. Long live Edelgard and the Adrestian Empire. #FireEmblem:ThreeHouses
Been looking forward to this run all week. Hoping to see the strats for Riven, my team has been stuck since Tuesday.
777 train to fight riven legit
Unbelievable that we got that Final Fantasy VI run, let's get that Pokemon Blue TAS too!
Can we get a $24.02 train for Datto. Also we need to see the full riven fight because it's too good to not see #24.02
FOR CAYDE!
"So what are you gonna do today""get up and personal with my computer, watch speedrunners destroy last wish, then maybe eat a sandwich"
FEAR THE DEER
I'm sure this will finally break the curse. Are you over 999 light? Much love from Bungie!
sadly cant watch the run live cuz im at work, but heres some money towards fighting Riven of a Thousand Voices the legit way ;) and to a good cause as well
 (Comment rejected)
Haven't been able to check out a GDQ stream for a while, but I definitely had to show up for my favorite game! Get that ahamkara down, Guardians, and make us all proud!
Trying to prevent cancer, O Guardians mine? My teeth are extra sharp and ready for you to face me legitimately and end the curse....and cancer itself. Good luck on the run!!
Finally get to donate after almost a decade! Good luck to all the runners and put this towards making the protagonist of Three Houses a von Aegir.
Been watching GDQ rather casually for the past few years and this is my first time donating. Hopefully this makes up for some lost time? It makes sense to donate during one of my favourite games of all time. I recently lost my Grandpa to cancer this September and I would wish that upon no-one. Here's a wish to eliminate cancer for all good.Eyes up, Guardians.
Thank you for awesome event!
Donating during a very good game that I never anticipated to be at a GDQ.Donation can go to Datto and CammyCake's Choice
FEAR THE DEER
Couldn’t wait to see D2 on AGDQ. So many hours in this game it almost hurts seeing it ran this fast. Good luck on the runs and let’s raid against cancer!
Had to donate during one of my all time favourite games, keep it up guardians. Get revenge for me guardians
Hi GDQ, this donation goes to setting the Fire Emblem Main Character's Birthday to today, my friend Atty's birthday. I'll donate another $50 if everyone in the crowd wishes Atty a Happy Birthday.
Had to donate during one of my favorite games during my favorite game. Kill that dragon and cleanse that heart!
Here's $5 to get that Riven kill the right way
My boyfriend and I love watching speedruns together and we love destiny so had to donate during the Last Wish run. My best friend lost her mom to cancer last year so we are both do grateful for this event. Thank you GDQ!
So happy to see a Destiny stream here at AGDQ. Speedruns for Destiny raids were my original introduction to speedruns and the only I've ever attempted myself. Best of luck to tonight's guardians!
<3
Hi Dad, it's me Ozzy! I wanted to say hi, I miss you, good luck on your run, and I am being a very good boy, so bring me home treats! PS: Please come home soon, Mommy sucks at playtime. Snuggles and kisses, Ozzy #BalancedGlide
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank just outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can punch through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.
A wish to end cancer forever.Good luck, runners!
So cool to see Destiny at AGDQ!! Great job Guardians!!
Been a fan of watching GDQ for a few years now, and SO pumped to see my favorite game being run this year! Had to donate during Last Wish to show the Destiny raiders some love! It feels like watching the World First race all over again!
Incredibly happy to see Destiny on display at GDQ, Last Wish is the best raid (Don't @ me)
Watching this with my clan Preachers of The Light tonight. So excited to see Destiny in a GDQ, and so excited that it's Last Wish!
Eyes up Guardians! After being a part of the wonderful Destiny community from the first Alpha I was finally able to fulfill my dream of working at Bungie. It makes me so glad to see Last Wish run at AGDQ and knew I couldn't pass up a chance to donate to help kick cancer's ass! Let's try and get that legit Riven incentive, no GL cheese tonight! ;)
AGDQ! Bring a sword!!Have yet to do this raid, so its amazing to see. Let's all be guardians against cancer.
From the Tiger Style to the wonderful efforts of the GDQ community. Congrats on the 1 million, now let.'s get 1.5 million!
Seeing this raid destroyed is absolutely amazing.
Eyes up, guardians
Hi Dad, it's me Kal! I wanted to say good luck on your run! We are watching at home, and Ozzy is being stinky. We miss you and hope you are coming back soon! Mommy also said to say Prolix is the most awesome and he can put my donation towards whatever we want! Love, Kal! PS: Kal Pals for life!!! #BalancedGlide
Whether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with cancer on Earth, so let's get to taking it out
FFVI. Destiny. And Three Houses? And I get to listen to Datto? What a night!
As a long time speedrunner and Destiny player this is really cool to see in the marathon. As a Warlock main it's even better. Good luck, and shoutouts to the Five Oh Two Krew!
Love watching a raid that took hours to beat the first time get wrecked in minutes. Shoutouts to my clan, sparklepony for life!
I just graduated last spring and promised myself I would give back when I could. No better time to do it, than during my current favorite game. Keep up the great work GDQ! Runners, don't forget the Thousand-Layer Cookies!
Hey AGDQ, so glad to see one of my favorite "mmos" getting destroyed for charity and shout out to my good friend Tokeegee. Hope you know how proud I am seeing all your hard work pay off dude. Thank you to all the kind people working to kick cancer's butt, and one final shout out to Datto's favorite food: cheese. Donation goes to Tokeegee's choice. #balancedglide

Had to donate during one of my favorite games- So happy to see AGDQ trying a new kind of speedrun and as usual Datto with the fantastic commentary. Happy to continue supporting Prevent Cancer foundation. Happy to see donations hit the million and hope to see those numbers keep going up! Also excited to see one of my favorite games of last year, Fire Emblem up next!
Thanks to cancer research my mom's breast cancer was found early and she's now one year cancer free, so I couldn't not donate during my absolute favourite game! Please continue to fixing problems with bullets, Guardians!
Donating for my favorite game! I'll donate another 10 if someone recites the "Whether we wanted it or not" copypasta on stream.
Hey, AGDQ! Love watching the event, thanks to the staff and runners for everything they do. Keep up the good work!
Please I haven't finished Golden Deer yet. $25 for Black Eagles!
Love destiny and wanted to donate during this block. Lost my father to brain cancer this year, and I wanted to show my support to end this terrible disease. Good luck runners!
YEEEEEEEEE HAAAAAAAAAW! Greetings from the Hat Nerds. This run has been very exciting to watch, and I am incredibly happy for you all. <3
Much love from Bungie to all the Last Wish runners!
Cheers from the raiding Clan NOOT. Been playing since beta D1 and stoked to see a raid run at a GDQ.
As Shaxx says, leave the cheese on the moon. Let's see a legit Riven!
24:02Sorry Datto, had to do it... :)
Greetings from Bungie! Programmer from the Destiny raids team here.. I've been watching GDQs since 2014, and it's always been a dream of mine to have something I worked on absolutely destroyed on a GDQ. Thanks for making my dream come true. :)

Also a special shout out to my aunt who is currently battling pancreatic cancer. Best of luck to all the remaining runners this week.
One more donation before I go to bed. Good luck runners!
Destiny speedrunning is one of the coolest activities you can do in Destiny. I promised my clan that I would donate $25 for each One Thousand Voices obtained at the end plus another $50 for each crash experienced by a runner.
FEAR THE DEER
Claude is best waifu. Can't wait for this excellent run!
Thank you runners for making this able to happen and giving others hope. Here is something to believe in.

When humanity stands strong, and people reach out for each other... we can defeat cancer!
Looking forward to the Fire Emblem Three Houses run, with so many people I know who have played this. Gotta go Black Eagles for House choice. And congrats again everyone for hitting 1 million. Let's keep it going!
Edelgard was right!
I won't be too sad if the Deer win because Lysithea's amazing, but... I must protect Edelgard!
I am currently playing FE: Three Houses and this game is emotionally causing me a lot of pain. Therefore, I'm quite fine with it being run through as fast as possible! Good luck to the runners and remember, Edelgard is waifu for laifu!
FEAR THE DEER!!! ALL OF MY MONEY FOR GOLDEN DEERMOCRACY!!
As promised here are my donations for the raid run. Here's 100 for the non-wipe encounter clears. Even though they didn't go flawless, I will donate 100 for the crazy double 1000 voices drop. It took me 16 weeks to get it. Absolutely insane. Here's to hoping that we get a Destiny 1 or 2 raid marathon run at a later GDQ
BLACK 👏 EAGLE 👏 STRIKE 👏 FORCE
Here for Three Houses with Claris. What an amazing game by a hard working runner! Stride and Warp your way to victory Claris!
After a rough couple years and hard battle, I lost my dad to colon cancer last year. I'm happy to see such a great community and have a way I can help support the fight against something so terrible that affects so many people. Thank you to everyone that makes GDQ marathons possible and everyone who supports it.
FEAR THE DEER!
Had to get a donation in for FE3H, my favourite game in the last year! And who doesn't love Claude?

Three Houses re-in-vitalized my love for Fire Emblem, and probably one of my favorites next to Path of Radiance, I cant wait to see this amazing game get destroyed by Claris. Put my donation towards Golden Deer Being picked because Claude is probably the best lord hands down... FEAR THE DEER!
Had to donate for the Fire Emblem: 3 Heroes run. This was my first major Fire Emblem game and I absolutely had a blast, putting over 200 hours into the game. I can't wait to see what Claris has in store to show us about this game! Donation goes to the Super Mario World "One Mind Hard Mode", because that sounds absolutely insane.
For the Black Eagles. Edelgarde was right. Down with crests. Down with cancer.
Greetings Profeesor! Nothing to report, just a donation to choose the Blace Eagle Route in FIre Emblem 3 Houses. All hail lady Edelgard!

Let's go Edelgard!
Shoutout to Claris and the entire FE 3H speedrunning discord which let me feel very welcome in learning this game and how I could help route this behemoth. This was almost half a year ago and nearly everything I helped route in has been routed out since but my one claim to fame was thinking to add in Annabelle's rallys into chapter 7. I'll add another 25 if this is read during Chapter 7. Claris *big breath* Impress every last one of them!
For Ferdinand Von Aegir! The hero we need to defeat cancer
fear the deer
My heart goes to the Sun and Moon watching awesome people show off their skills. I work in an Outpatient Oncology center and hear many of my patients swear, literally and figuratively, how they will conquer their disease and not die because of it. Some do and some do not. Though I am happy to support them and their family during this trying time in their lives I cannot wait for the day that my beloved profession is no longer needed. Yes... Ironic.. I know. So screw off cancer (My patients words and mine) and let's keep working to make the prevention of cancer a reality and no longer a dream!
Go fire emblem!
Fear the deer!
Hyped for the Last Wish run! Happy to see Destiny included.
Have to shout out how good that Ocarina run was last night (and all the others of course!) Keep up the donations everyone.
Donating for Black Eagles because Edelgard is best girl and Fire Emblem 3 Houses is an amazing speedrun community. Good luck Claris!
Fear the deer!
Let's stop cancer and stan LOONA!
That Destiny run was wild.
Donated earlier tonight, but had to get another one in for the Ike art, Spyro Switch, and other prizes! Let's go Golden Deer and the best boy, Raphael! #FearTheDeer
love the stream, keep up the great work you amazing people you
Whether we wanted it or not, here's $50 for charity. Congrats on the Two Thousand Voices and great speedrun of Last Wish.
Been watching GDQ since the beginning but never had the funds to donate until recently. I lost my younger brother to acute myeloid leukemia years ago and want to do my part helping to prevent cancer. Donation goes to Black Eagles for Fire Emblem Three Houses.
Loving this AGDQ, first time donating, let's save Fodlan, and cut down cancer
FEAR THE DEER! FEAR THE DEER! FEAR THE DEER!

Dear Sent... Please don't smack your self in the face. The prizes don't like it. PS: 1 million HYPE!!!

While I am personally Team Blue Lions, the Golden Deer are also a good group of students that hold a special place in my heart. Just remember though; the crests are to blame!
My Aunt beat breast cancer last year, this event was always close to my heart and now it is to my whole family.
Been watching all week, loving every minute. Thanks for all you do!
Go Golden Deer!
Stay Hydrated!

It's incredible to see Destiny 2 at AGDQ, especially a speed run of Last Wish, and GGs to the fantastic runners and couch. This was going to be $25, but after seeing TWO One-Thousand Voices drops... in a row?! I can't even right now... so have $100 for each.

Fire Emblem: Three Houses has become one of my all-time favorite games due to how amazing it is.

You all are awesome for raising so much already to help fight off cancer, and let's keep it going!Oh, and fear the deer!

Please not the Deer.

Professor! Did you like my donation? I just couldn't help but notice you named yourself after me! I'm honored, truly.
Sigh, you're making me work.
GDQ is my favorite success story. Thank for suck a beautiful proof that we exist as a very real community. Now : How much wood would a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood? A woodchuck would chuck as much wood as a woodchuck would chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood.

Hello from Serenes Forest! We figured the Fire Emblem fan community should donate while our beloved franchise is on the international stage, so we held a little donation pool and put our wallets together to chip in. Good luck and we just hope everyone has fun competing. Please put the donation to runner's choice!
HONK!
Thank you all for everything you do to bring light to this world.
Didnt think we'd be so excited to be tricked into watching a destiny raid learning video. Excited for fire emblem and pumped to hit 2 million! HOOONK!
Just got back in to the Fire Emblem craze after last years run! May the RNG be ever in your favor Claris.
Fire emblem oh yeah! Go fast
Just saw Subnautica pop up on one of the next games to play. I couldn't be more hyped to see my favourite survival game of all time and the survival game that got me into survival games up to be speedrunned. Can't wait!
Hey Claris and gang! Good luck on the run and let's land all the critical hits on cancer!#FearTheDeer
Good luck to the runners!
I am Ferdinand Von Aegir and it would be unfit for a noble to NOT contribute to such a noble cause. Consider this donation my noble fulfillment to my noble duty as a noble!
This is for my Dad who struggles with skin cancer, and my girlfriend's Dad who passed away from prostate cancer.
Three Houses is one of my favorite games of all time, and my game of the year 2019. i want to give a shout out shout out to Claude, Hilda, Lysithea, and a happy belated birthday to my darling gf, Sonia.
In memory of my brother Alex who passed two months ago at age 34 from a rare form of cancer. Good luck to all the Destiny 2 runners!
Yesterday my mother went for the results from her 14th anniversary of being free from cancer, and happily was told there wasn't anything there. Been a watcher since 2013 and happy to watch another fire emblem run.
Hilda! Hilda! Hilda! oh and Claude is pretty great too. Runners Choice for Donation!
Go Claris; you can do it!
I hope we can eradicate this terrible disease! Having beaten Leukemia, I really would love to hear of a cure one day. Good luck to all the runners and thank you so much to all the workers and helpers at AGDQ; I look forward to every event!
Shoutout to Claris, one of my favorite GDQ runners! Glad to see you on the main stage for another run!
First time donating, so excited to see my favorite Switch game run at AGDQ by one of my favorite Metroid series speedrunners. Always remember: it is most rude to interrupt a moment of repose, for sleep helps a student grow.
For my dear von Aegir~! Terribly excited to see Three Houses run live. But I have to know...coffee or tea?
Fire Emblem is one of my favorite series of all times and got me through some hard times. So happy to see it run at AGDQ. FEAR THE DEER!!!!
For Chris, my favorite random guy!
Had to donate during my game of the year 2019. Love everything about GDQ, and can't wait to see how much we raise this week. Good luck on the run! HILDA! HILDA! HILDA!
This is for Jenny putting up with me taking this whole week off to watch speed runs and not do chores around the house.
donating for a chance at that bioshock artwork as an anniversary gift!and to beat Cancer's mean face in. late night HOOOONK
Might not be doing a Spyro run this year but that is one sweet switch, and its going to a good cause.
Been loving watching this stream all week. Especially loved the Zelda runs! Thanks GDQ for all you do! I also love supporting the Prevent Cancer Foundations since cancer has affected my family a couple of different times over the last 10 years. Best of luck to all the runners!
FEAR THE DEER! [deer emoji]
A Pokemon Blue TAS? Yes please!
happy birthday johnny brock
Love ADGQ! I love Fire Emblem and I love this cause. We lost my grandpa 10 years ago and my aunt is a breast cancer survivor who's been in remission since 2015 Good luck Runners!
I unfortunately won't be watching this run because I want to play this game eventually, but best of luck to the runner, Claris.
1 Million by Thursday night? Does that mean we're going to hit 3 million this year? We can do it! I believe in us!
awesome speedruns! Now I need me some fried chicken
Last Wish was amazing, gotta love ole Datto! Let's finish the evening strong with some Fire Emblem!
Huge fan of Fire Emblem and of GDQ. It's always a pleasure to donate to such a worthwhile cause, when I can. Also...What do you do if you see cancer cells?KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM!
Greetings from Hawaii! I just had to donate during my favorite switch game! Watching all the speedruns has given me confidence to give it a go too! Thanks to everyone at GDQ for supporting an awesome cause. Good luck on the run, teach! FEAR THE DEER!!
Loving the commentary on this Fire Emblem Three Houses run, best of luck Claris!
Thank you for continuing such an amazing event for such a great cause.
I love Claris's runs and she's gonna kill it (and more than a few students)!Of course, also gotta donate for MAH BOI Claude!FEAR THE DEER!

Thrilled to see my favorite game in AGDQ! The Three Houses community is incredible, and I love my Ferdibert Family. We are all Ferdinand von Aegir!
Please don't beat this game that took me 80 hours tonight. My pride can't take it. I'm not reading a donation message anymore. I'm just so excited about my favorite Golden Deer - Hilda! Hilda! Hilda! Hilda! Hilda! Hilda! Hilda!Wow - what an incredible donation.

Let's smash that 2016 AGDQ record tonight!
Just wondering couch- Do you hear the Futurama song when the bells ring in Three Houses? I just... I can't unhear it. Ferdinand is best boy! Best of luck on the run!
Thank you to all to everyone who makes this event possible. Also, hi Sarah.

Fire Emblem is my favorite series of all time ever since roy was my boy in smash bros!! So excited to see Three Houses being run at AGDQ, i’ll throw in another $25 if the whole couch shouts I AM FERDINAND VON AEGIR!!!
My beloved Golden Deer won the war....but at what cost? Regardless, cheers to 10 years of GDQ! Thanks for all the entertaining runs!
Thanks to everyone, both speedrunners and all the staff, for everything they're doing. I've recently lost a good friend of mine to cancer and definitely would never want anyone else to go through this. So i hope that this pulls that future a bit closer. Also, Lysithea best student!
Hey all, so happy to see this game run at it's first GDQ after release. Can we get a $5 best girl train going? Here's $5 to say that Edelgard is the one true empress of Fodlan.Much love from the Bastion speedrun community -Captain Jim Hornswaggle
I am Ferdinand Von Aegir.
Glad to see all of us coming together again to be able to fight against cancer. Love and Peace!
I appreciate what you guys are doing. I've lost many family members due to cancer. Thank you for all you guys do!
You think you're the best Three Houses runner just because you're Captain Jeralt's daughter? I was Captain Jeralt's first and best apprentice, and I can beat this faster than anyone, even you, even on Maddening.
VonAegir is really making a smooth transition from Mercenary to Professor here.
Golden deer is my favorite house, so excited for this speedrun. Best of luck, also is that the one?
Hilda! Hilda! Hilda!(If the GDQ site adds numbers to my name ignore them, it's simply TheMasterDS)
#MarioLight
Just an FYI. Petra is the best girl. If you disagree, how does it feel to be wrong?
Hey Claris and Kirby! I'm glad I got home JUST IN TIME in order to CATCH this run!
Good luck to all the runners! Love Fire Emblem so happy to see it here. Help kill cancer by letting my students die!

Fear the Deer! Donation goes to Runner's choice :)

Good luck with the Golden Deer speedrun!!! #Thunderbrand
I am Ferdinand von Aegir, legitimate son of the Aegir family.
I have something to ask of you: Fear the deer!
My mom was diagnosed with bladder cancer few years ago. But thanks to early detection and treatment, the cancer is currently in remission. She is having her next check up tomorrow, so here's hoping the cancer doesn't come back!
so glad to see fire emblem at gdq this year. I look forward to these events every year. Thanks to everyone involved for all the good you do. Good luck Claris!
Super excited to see this Three Houses run! It sure was nice of VonAiger to let all of her students except Claude and Lysithea skip all their classes and battles. That's what happened right?
Fight on!
Oh deer. This should be a golden run! Seriously, though, so excited to see Fire Emblem at GDQ!
After seeing that mind blowing Last Wish raid, and now fire emblem! I am always moved by everyone getting together for this great cause.
I am Ferdinand Honk Aegir
Hey claris and kirby! I'm very disappointed in you all for not choosing the name Bartre. >:( By the way, why all the love for Ferdinand von Aegir when Lorenz Hellman Gloucester is the one true noble among nobles?
Had to get in a good donation for the best game I've ever played. I think there's a bug though, why isn't Claude upside down?
A fire emblem 3 houses speedrun? Aegir just HAD to donate
Received 50 dollars from the Church of Seiros as funding for this month's activities.
I am the legitimate heir of to house Aegir
First time able to catch this live, and definitely donating during Three Houses! Go Golden Deer!
That was beautiful, the noble standard even! Hearing all those voices made a pegasus dance with joy! Good luck on the rest of the run & bless RNG for strength!!
Games good, cancer bad. Bless RNG!
Girl. Here's a little something to help set cancer on Fire, just like those...Emblems. Donation goes to runner's choice.
That Cancer fella sounds like pretty bad news. Let’s beat him up!
Dorothea is best girl! I'm very happy to see one of my new favorite games on the GDQ stage. Good luck Claris!
Missed half an hour but I'm here! Claude best boi tbh.
He is standing on the Pokeball
Wish I could've at least died at home...not in this big, stupid field...Donation to runner's choice.
Let me paint you a picture!
Maybe the real Ferdinand Von Aegir is the money we raised to help prevent cancer. In which case, I am Ferdinand Von Aegir!
Always love Fire Emblem, and even though Blue Lions is my house I'll watch and cheer for Golden Deer! Fear the Deer!
People like to debate which house is the best house in this game (Black Eagles, btw) but I know one thing we can all agree on: Lysithea is ridiculously overpowered.
#BylethForSmash
Hello, Hi, Hey AGDQ! Thanks for running 3 Houses, a game that has been so much fun to play for the last 6 months. The Fire Emblem series has always been near and dear to my heart since the games first made it to the West, so its only right that I make a donation during this run. I hope to see this game again at future GDQ events so we can see all the routes run someday. My donation is in honor of the true best House, the Blue Lions! Next time let's save Dimitri, and as for cancer, KILL EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM!!!!
Fire Emblem is definitely one of my favorite series! ˙ʎoq ʇsǝq sᴉ ǝpnɐlƆ
It took me 120 hours the first time I beat this game! so fascinating to see the other extreme. Kudos to the couch for the fantastic commentary. Good luck to Claris and the CLAUDE SQUAD 8)
Wooooooo
Hey! It's Clarical from the Speedrunning Discord. Big shoutout to everyone on the discord, it's been a good community to get into. Can't wait for that sweet all chapters speedrun for Three Houses there Kirbymastah. Fear the Deer!
There's nothing wrong with having a long play time on these games. There's no much to do, and so much to see; so what's wrong with taking the back-streets?
Thank you for the entertainment and for doing a good thing. :)
YOU CAN SUBDUE DEDUE NEITHER ON THE BATTLEFIELD NOR THE DANCE FLOOR
My wife and I are so happy for the run and are representing our favorite houses with our House shirts right now. I'm definitely excited that best house won so to that I say, FEAR THE DEER! So awesome that Joe Zieja chimed in btw! We love his streams!
I absolutely adore Fire Emblem. It blew my mind that this game was even created so it’s surreal to see it in GDQ. Thank you so much!
I have nothing to ask of you, because you are not killing Flayn. Thank the Goddess!Thank you for this amazing run!!
I'll donate $5 more if the audience takes a moment to say "trans lives matter".
$1,000,000? Amazing. Keep it up.
Dance every last one of them! I’m a Blue Lions fan, but I’m so excited to root for the Deer to help beat cancer. Can’t wait for the final boss! Donation goes towards runner’s choice.
My wife and I poured around 160 hours over all three houses throughout the summer and fall. Joe, we loved your voice acting throughout every play through - Claude and the Golden Deer were our favourites. It is so exciting to hear you supporting GDQ and joining Claris and the couch on this amazing run. Thanks to all the runners and staff for making GDQ amazing and joining forces for beating Cancer for good.
Had to donate during a speedrun of my favorite game of 2019! Huge shoutout to the couch. I've already learned so many new things about the game I will use for my 2nd playthrough. Black eagle strike force for life!
HILDA HILDA HILDA HILDA
Been donating every GDQ so far, let's keep it up on one of my favorite games of last year. Spent a lot of time on this game and after I finished one route I decided to look up a speedrun and it was like 2 hours. I was pretty amazed that it could be done so quickly...Put this towards the Pokemon Blue TAS because more games can never hurt.
My Grandfather, a cancer researcher, passed away last year. I know he'd be thrilled that so many runners put the same passion into their games as he did into his research. Thank you for this awesome event!
DONATE TO EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM
Fear the Deer! Love you, Joe!
I only picked Golden Deer because I wanted to romance Claude. And now his sweet sweet voice is coming through my speakers. *swoon*
Is it acceptable to donate with a reference to Claude Von Zieja's birthday?
I am Ferdinand von Aegir!
The knights of Seiros have arrived! Hey, they're getting away!
Thanks for the birthday wishes, Atty loved them!
If VonAegir married Ferdinand, would she be say "I am VonAegir von Aegir?"
Awww yeah having fun speed running games and making money for a good cause! get it!
Thank you to all the wonderful folks of AGDQ for an amazing run of Fire Emblem Three Houses so far. Fear the Deer!!!
Fire Emblem: Three Honks
Three Houses pun time! What did Dimitri say to his retainer when he got a new haircut?"New do, Dedue?"God i'm sorry that's terrible.
Three Houses was my first FE game. I fell in love with it quite quickly. This has been a really fun run so far. While my only house left is golden dear, I don't feel like I've been spoiled on the story, which is the best part of this run.
*Read to the tune of Domo Arigato Mr. Roboto*Domo Arigato Gato RobotoMeow meow. Meow meow.
I spent my entire Summer playing Three Houses and I loved every minute of it!! So great to see it run really fast when I initially thought it took forever to play through!! And having Joe Zieja as guest during this run is an awesome treat!! As always keep up the good work towards kicking cancer's butt and remember to FEER THE DEER!!
AGDQ is always my favorite way to start the year. Keep up the great work, everyone!
Fire Emblem has been my favorite franchise ever and now that we have some of my favorite runners ever on the couch with Joe on as well, I have to donate. Donation goes to runner's choice.
Can the couch say trans rights?
Finally able to donate for once. Just wanted to wish all the runners good luck, thank all of the wonderful staff, and help kick cancer in the butt!!!!
♥️
So glad to see Golden Deer win! Now to see how my favorite character performs in a speedrun! Hilda! Hilda! Hild-oh... Oh no... Well, good luck on the run away!
Wow, this Black Eagles run looks really weird! Anyway shout out to the best house: Black Eagles.
I am the ghost of Ferdinand von Aegir
Greetings Professor! Nothing to report. Donating to support the Black Eagles! All hail Lady Edelgard!
Fear the deer
We killed Ferdie, Claris. He used to be our friend. Do you remember those days?
GO Claris! You are doing amazing!!!
Edelgard did nothing wrong!
I dislike two things: the unjust crest system upheld by the nobility and the Church of Seiros and cancer, so let's beat both!
FEAR THE DEER! So awesome of you to do this and with the best house!
Had to donate for one of my favorite Fire Emblem titles! Deer is my SECOND favorite house, only losing out to my lovely Blue Lions. Fear the Deer and let's kill cancer!
NO BERNIE NOOOOOOOOOOO
Really enjoying this Fire Emblem run. Nice work Claris and couch!
Three Houses is amazing and holds a special place in my heart. My aunt lost her life to cancer a couple of years ago, and the impact on my family was something I hope few people have to go through. Keep up the good fight friends. Fear the Deer!
Next year; can we have a save Bernie incentive?
Happy to see GDQ back again! Can't wait to see Tony Hawk.
Although this isn’t the Blue Lions, I am thoroughly enjoying this run! Now if only I could actually finish this game at this speed...
Fire emblem! Cancer should fear the deer
had to donate during my favorite game of 2019!! good luck to the runners and shoutout to the best house! fear the deer!🦌💛
Fear the deer! Watching this game be obliterated is amazing! Let's see those bosses!
Five more if the couch does their best "Greetings, Professor!"
Three Houses helped me through a very rough period when my partner was diagnosed with cancer, so donating is a perfect way to pay that back. Fear the Deer!
Had to donate during my favorite game of the past year. Fear the Deer!
Had to donate during one of my favorite series, I loved Radiant Dawn and have been into Fire Emblem ever since. Both my mom and mother-in-law beat breast cancer, this donation is for them!
Go Claris! #BernadettaDeservedBetter
Love GDQ, My partner and I watch it whenever it's on. Thanks for raising so much for an awesome cause!
Fire Emblem has been so fun! Good luck and wreck cancer!
girl
It’s incredible that video games are helping to fight cancer. Keep it up!
I am Basch fon Ronsenburg!
Hey, did Claud leave? 'Cause I'd pick Black Eagles over Golden Deer any day.
shouts out to playing fire emblem in the club
L,l,listen- as long as you don't come in my room then I don't care which h,h,house you picked!But... Good luck defeating cancer professor!<Bernie is the real best girl and we all know it.>
Let’s destroy cancer like Claude is destroying this run! Thanks for playing Fire Emblem and fear the deer!
Great to see one of my favorite games from last year played for such a great cause! Though -- please tell me someone is working on a "save as many students as possible" run?!
My dad passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2007 and my life changed forever. I’m so grateful for the Prevent Cancer Foundation and GDQ for working to get to a world where no young person has to lose a parent to such a horrible disease. Donation goes to runner’s choice.
You're all welcome.
I missed Destiny since I was driving but I wanted to donate during the game that helped me out of some serious depression and where I met my girlfriend. Keep up the great Fire Emblem run guys! It's super entertaining and informative. This donation is for my grandpa who's beaten cancer twice.
Keep up the great work
On cintinue et on remporte ce troisième défis FR ! #Goupix
Hey ! Cute Monster Props here. I am loving so many great runs and all the kind things everyone has been saying about my prize donations. Did you know that Speedrun is an anagram of Deer Puns? Call me a blind stag because I had No Eye Deer! Hopefully donating a few bucks make up for does puns. Shout out to my Deer Sophia, the best Edelgard.
Fire Emblem: Three Houses is the best game ever--so happy to see it at GDQ. Let's beat cancer!
The world needs more TASbot and more dwango.
F in chat for Ferdinand. Great job playing, this has been such an enjoyable run to watch, GJ Claris!
I was loving this Fire Emblem run, and then Lysithea died. How could you?
Love to see some 3 Houses action alreadyDorothea truthers rise up!
Great run, but as a Fire Emblem fan I keep needing to ignore my usual reaction of resetting the chapter every time a character dies.
Took me 110 hours to beat FE:3H on the first run now your gonna complete in less than 2 hr? Awesome. Keep up the good work. Always love watching speed runs.
Wife and I have been watching for years and love what you all do. Keep up the great work and let's "Fire" cancer for good!
Our first million of the decade and it feels so good. Let's make it to 2 at the very least! Make cancer's death as permanent as a lost unit in Fire Emblem!
Learning Claude and I share a birthday was such a wonderful surprise for this run. Y’all are doing a great job, and now I can’t wait to play Three Houses for the first time.
My best friend introduced me to GDQ almost 6 years ago now, and I cannot thank him enough, its always so amazing to see everyone come together to do such incredible things. So I would like to say thank you to the runners, the hosts, the techs, and all the supporters and donators of this and every other GDQ event, you are all simply amazing.
<3
Le théoricrafting est en marche, voici mon 4e don de 5$, stay tuned pour le 5e. On donne, on donne mais les vrais héros c'est VOUS le staff du Frenchrestream, vous êtes stylés, des bisous, cordialement ! #ParraPluie PS : Bioshock c'est trop bien et go André Ryan ?
That Fire Emblem Three Houses run was fun to watch. Props to Claris for a great run and I'll definitely be picking up the game for myself on Switch. Thanks GDQ!
I almost to forgot to donate for my daily donation today and it's 11PM for me so it still counts? If not I'll donate 40 more dollars with my next daily donation! Let's kick cancer where it hurts!
FEAR THE DEER
Honk
This is the first GDQ I've watched at home in two years, but I've got a good reason for not being there: the birth of my daughter. We named her Marnie, so I guess you can say I'm a de facto member of Team Yell. I will cheer her on to the best of my ability, and that includes trying to get her name chosen in a bid war for the X/Y character name. Shoutouts to CovertMuffin and the rest of the volunteers behind the scenes that are putting on a great show this year!
I missed out on edf but I still gotta show my support.
Bioshock, more like Bioshonk!
Need to head to bed, but I heard Covert_Muffin so I had to donate. Thanks to GDQ for all you do! Donation goes to Covert's choice!
I neeeeed that Spyro-themed Switch! Also, that 3 houses run was awesome! Fear the deer!
I want to thank everyone who works on gdq for creating an opportunity for the gaming community to come together for such a great cause. As someone who has recently lost a love one to cancer, seeing my community giving so much for the cause could not make me any more proud.
Thank you AGDQ, Merci LeFrenchRestream
V for Victory! V for Valiant! V for VVVVVV 100 percent glitchless! VERY excited when we hit that donation incentive!
A Man Chooses (to donate), A Slave Obeys (the order to donate)So "Would you kindly donate"
More GDQ and its a TAS. Sign me up!
Been enjoying all the runs so far! Fire Emblem was fantastic and blew our minds! Here's hoping it comes back next year so Blue Lions get a shot at running (and James will stop pouting about it).
i love you, covertmuffin
have fun and game on...just make it quick
We all make donations, but in the end, our donations make us. Would you kindly help me prevent cancer?
I had to stay up to contribute during one of my all-time favorite games. With two friends who made it through ovarian cancer and a housemate who's recovering from his second bout with leukemia, this cause means a great deal to me. Good luck on your run, and remember the words of Andrew Ryan: "A man chooses; a goose honks."
Would you Kindly read this comment?Good luck with the run BT. here's $5 for every "Would You Kindly" that will be said for the run. Would you Kindly Counter: 17.Incentive to Runner's Choice.
OH BAYBEE
Hi!
Instead of BioShock, what if there was a game called CabbageShock? You play as a genetically enhanced cabbage stuck underwater. #cabbage
Would you kindly take my donation?
Go BLOOD THUNDER - Love from your CAT
Donating to this great cause and love how many years it's continued to make a difference. The content creators and the passion they all share help drive the marathon but it is the viewers and supporters that show the true heart. I had to donate while CovertMuffin is reading donations because he's my favorite.
First time donating, but y’all are the best. Let’s shock those Bios, or actually HONK those HONKS
Hey Bloodthunder, It was your run back at AGDQ 2016 that finally convinced me to play the bioshock series, good luck on your run.
First time donating! Finally have money to donate and what better game to donate then my favorite game of all time! Good luck on the run and show me how it's done! Money goes to runners choice.
Shout out to my brother from another mother, Eric Glover, the most giving person I know. Love you man.
What’s up GDQ? Had to donate while BT running Bioshock, good to see you here again. Cheers from the cabbage squad!
Good luck with your run BloodThunder,@Bryonato, sadly I can't catch your Wolfenstein run, but at least I can name myself FADEFREAnd those 5$ are for doing the noises !!
Please make Covert sing the whale song!
Andrew Ryan would probably hate me for donating to charity which is all the more reason for me to do it.
Let's get some whale noises from our host!
I want that whale song
*Whalenoises*
Lets hear some wonderful whale noises!
Can we get some Whale noises?Runner's choice
Hey, GDQ! Had to show some love for the game that spawned my favorite game of all time, and the story DLC that wrecked me emotionally, Burial at Sea. Let’s kick cancer’s butt!
Wwwwwwiiiiiillll yyyyyyyoooooouuuuuuu kiiiiiiiiinndlyyyyyy. Love ya BT, couch and of course, Mr. Covert Muffin
Would you kindly let BloodThunder know this $50 is to encourage him to let us hear *his* Dory impression?
Whale noises please!
DR. MUFFIN, YOUR PEOPLE DEMAND WHALE (NOISES)
COVERT BE THE WHALEMAKE THE WHALE NOISES
I want to hear that beautiful Dorry Whale voice
Well...do it
That Atlas guy seems like a pretty decent dude
Hey, BT! Hey, Covert, how about that Dory whale song?!
Dory Whale Noises
Generic whale noises are good enough for me. Let's hear them CovertMuffin!
 (Comment rejected)
I hooooooopppeee yooouuuuuuuu speeeeeaaaaak whaaaalleeeeee
A man chooses to donate
He asked so nicely.
I would like the whale song please. So happy to finally be at my first GDQ and connecting with friends from online, including the Kingdom Hearts community, who is very dear to my heart. Putting this towards playing as Terra for Birth By Sleep. Also hi Bryanato, how's Dragon?
There’s a good chance I won’t be awake when “The Sun and Moon” is run, so I’m donating now. The music in that game is easily one of my favorite modern game soundtracks. Get it ‘Gyoo’
Mr. Muffin, would you kindly sing a whale song for everyone?
blugllugluglugulgulugglug (under water noises)
#cabbage (deep voice) FUEL FOR THE RUUUUUUUNNNN!!!

5 bucks for whale noises? You've got yourself a deal, fella!
Hey all Whaley the Whale here, felt compelled to donate for some weird reason after hearing that soothing voice ask me kindly. Don't really know why but oh well, it's for a good cause!
A man donates, a goose HONKS!
I wasn’t going to donate, but then BT asked if I would kindly donate, and I don’t know... I couldn’t stop myself...
Greetings. I felt compelled to donate from BloodThunder's kind way of asking. Would you kindly put this donation to runners choice.
Eeeeeeoooooooowwwwwooooo I want Muffin to say hi to me in my language and heard this was how eeeeeeeeewwwwwoooooo
Pretty sure someone owes me serious royalties for this game...oh well, have a donation anyway.
Hey BT! Gl on the run and thanks for leading the Cabbage Patch. PS. Thor is the best xoxo RPB
One of my favorite runners playing one of my favorite games! Try not to give the entire tech crew a heart attack this time. Thank you to everyone involved in GDQ for putting on such an amazing event in support of an awesome cause!
I was planning to donate later... but something bloodthunder said. I guess its turn a man chooses a slave donates
Chat, would you kindly join me in a $5 donation train?
boy-o boy-o boy-o
Would you kindly put this toward the VVVVVV glitchless 100% incentive?
Eeeeeeeeeeee? Eeeeeeeeeeeeeee. Oooooooooooooo. Oooooooooeeeeeeee. Eeeeeeeeeeeee! Oooooooooooo! Eeeeeeeeeeee...Donation to runner’s choice.
A Rapture Reminder. The parasite doesn't care if cancer is stopped, ignore the parasite and would you kindly donate to stop cancer. Good luck on the run!
Did someone say BEEEESSS
I saw that my favorite game of my favorite series Bioshock was being run, and I knew I this was the time. Thank you to all the runners and volunteers for keeping me entertained this week. It's always my favorite event of the year, and I make the choice to donate every year because as Andrew Ryan said, "A man chooses. A slave obeys." Money goes to Control - Ashtray Maze Showcase.
First time donater. Watched past 5 year almost every event and im going to watch at least next 5 year
Would you kindly accept a $25 donation for a fantastic cause!
Really cool run BloodThunder! Do you run Infinite as well, and are you a fan of how the lore tied the two together? (I personally think both games stand alone as masterpieces and are even better together!)
Would you kindly eradicate all of cancer?
I grew up with Spryo on the PS1 so a Switch with Spyro on it; TAKE MY MONEY. Its for a good cause XD.
*whale voice* Welcome to the Circus of Values!!! Hahahahaha
During this Bioshock run I suddenly I felt inclined to donate! Weird
Would You Kindly Start a $5 train?
I think we can all agree that was very whale done, Muffin!
BioShock is one of my all time favorite games! Good luck on the run!!
Over the last couple years I watched family fight the evil that is cancer. So far they have persevered or beat it all together. Here's to bringing an end to cancer. Thanks to the staff and runners for all the work you do to make this a reality.
I think Muffin said he wants a root beer float.
Good luck with the run BT
Hey, Bloodthunder! My boyfriend just told me that he now has to start running Bioshock again because you’re beating him in the leader boards now! Great run so far, it’s a lot of fun to watch. Thanks for being a part of this fantastic event. Now... Would you kindly go fast?
A man chooses. A slave obeys.A goose steals and...HONKS
audience would your kindly donate $5 to the incentive of your choice and support this great speedrun!
Please Say: WELCOME TO THE CIRCUS OF VALUUUUUUES!! (Vending Machine)
Would you kindly read this?
Would you kindly prevent cancer.
Contrôle ! Contrôle ! Ce matin j'ai un contrôle et j'ai pas révisé ! Autant le mettre en langue française pour que ce soit plus facile ! 10 dollars for French language in Control, keep up the donations flowing! Un grand merci au public du French Restream pour tous les dons.
$5 dono train. (whale noises optional haha) Much love BT and Bry
Cheers to another great GDQ! Let's get that Pokemon Blue TAS bonus run!
Hey BT! Great job so far on the run and good luck on the rest of it. Big thanks to the GDQ staff. Would you kindly donate to kick cancer's butt? HONK!
Hello AGDQ viewers! Would you kindly start a $5 hype train?
Would you Kindly EFF OFF Cancer?
Countless times watching, yet only second time donating. Games Done Quick always impresses. Great to see everyone working together to defeat cancer!
Had to donate during the run of my favorite game of all time. This runner and couch is awesome, but not as awesome as that Arcadia/Fort Frolic skip!
I think Andrew Ryan made a mistake when he allowed gun ammunition and substances that give people superpowers to be distributed in vending machines right next to each other. Then again maybe the whole underwater city thing was a bad idea altogether.
This year AGDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation have become more important to me than ever. 3 months ago my dad was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer, and he passed away from it 2 weeks ago. I hope this donation helps other families not have to go through the same tragedy that my family did. Good luck Bloodthunder and the rest of the runners! *Whale Noises*
Fish stick legs
Would you kindly donate during this run?
Whale voice- “Would you kindly go over estimate so we can see more bioshock?”
Thanks for taking time to appreciating us! Here's 10 bucks.
After a rough year including losing my grandmother to cancer AGDQ has been an amazing way to start the year. Good luck to the runners and a special shout out to Doctor Muffin.
Love seeing my dude BloodThunder going fast. The cabbages are cheering you on! Would you kindly smash this run?!
I was enraptured by the run, but then Bloodthunder showed us the fish. I was so blown out of the water I knew it was time. (whale voice) MORE FISH!
Suddenly Skyrim:"TOD HOWARD, YOU DID IT AGAIN!!"
$50 just for how dang funny that unexpected Skyrim meme was
Hey you you're finally awake
For Bioshock, my favorite game. And for the incredible Elder Scrolls Fake out
I feel JeBaited. Well played, BT.
That was awesome. I really thought you got a blue screen of death.
Even though there was no preventing Rapture's downfall, we can still work together to prevent cancer. Donation goes to runner's choice.
Blue screen troll earned $50! Well played BT...
10/10 skyrim memes
Bloodthunders swerve shocked me that much, 5 dollars fell out of my wallet. Might as well donate! Would you kindly also send me a new pair of underpants please?
Would you kindly keep those donations coming?
Cabbage cabbage. He is so round. Turn that frown. Upside down. #cabbage
Okay, nice fake-out, you got us good.
Amazing run of my favorite game of all time!! Would you kindly donate for the fight against cancer?As a survivor myself I really appreciate everyone involved in these events. <3
Lost my great grandma to cancer and my aunt is currently fighting it. Let's CONTROL cancer with the amazing Ashtray Maze showcase!
OK, I have to admit my heart stopped when I saw that supposed Blue Screen of Death. Well played, BT, well played. My sympathies to the couch. In any case, good luck with the run!
I was encouraged to kindly donate so here I am
Hey you. You're finally awake... The moon's haunted! Now kick cancer to the curb. More donations incoming!
shout out to my boy john (toughturkey) he's currently wathcing as well. more games less cancer!
Hey AGDQ! Watching the great Bioshock run with my sister, who sat next to me for moral support the first time I played through this game. So happy to support such a great cause! Thanks to all the runners and crew for such a great event!
Last chance to donate, kid.
Fear the Deer! Amazing Three Houses Run. Can’t wait to see the Celeste run later today! HILDA, HILDA!
Bioshock, Skyrim memes, and cancer prevention. This run truly has it all amazing run and amazing event
Shout out to FishfoxNuro in Twitch chat gifting over 100 subs for the amazing Bioshock troll, and a 5000% hype train!
I cannot unsee the camera cross-hair.
This is NOT the last chance to donate, let's do more and more.Great run
That Destiny 2 run was sweet.
Kierin loves speedruns!
Even though it's also my birthday later this month AGDQ is always the highlight of every January, and this year has been no exception! Keep up the great work and kick cancer's butt!
OMG that poor cat!
I'd like to give a shout out to my friend Catoxis. His family is dealing with a fight with cancer and I can see how rough it is on them. I just wanted him to know that we love him!Also I know you are supposed to spell cancer with a capital "C", but I refuse to give it the satisfaction!
 (Comment rejected)
Dimitri is love, Dimitri is life. I am Dimitri Trash even though Golden Deer is my house. Our Beloved Boy, Our King of Delusion. FORTUNE TO FAERGHUS!
Shoutouts to CovertMuffin who has been a staple of GDQs. I always look forward to his enthusiasm and love.
I unfortunately missed the destiny 2 last wish run but I can't wait to watch the run on youtube.
Co-op speedruns are very interesting and fun to watch for the amount of coordination required. Speaking of, I would really like to see a Portal 2 co-op run on GDQ someday.
My wife and I are loving the marathon. Thanks to everyone participating and donating! Good luck runners!
Hey Bryonato! So glad to be able to catch your run Wolfenstein at this GDQ. I'm always amazed by your ability to play incredibly difficult games while explaining extremely well the gameplay, so I know this run is going to be a BLAST.Good luck to TheFuncannon and yourself, and good run!Oh, and this donation goes towards the Ashtray Maze Showcase in Control ♥
Putting this towards naming Lucario “Oreo” in honor of my dog and best friend whose life was tragically cut short by an aggressive lymphoma. If you can’t save the animals, at least remember them.
Here’s another $25 donation! Shout out to floppy eared hat girl. She’s been there in the front row all week since I’ve been watching!
I've been looking forward to the Wolfenstein run all week, good luck to Bryo and Funcannon. Donation goes to Ashtray Maze!
Always blown away but how much talent everyone has! Really enjoyed every minute of this week so far and I’m happy to throw some bones for a good cause
I watch when I can and love what you guys are doing, keep it up gamers!
Thanks for that awesome Bioshock run, finally played the game for the first time recently, I loved it!
Last donation for tonight but I get paid tomorrow so maybe then?So excited for this Wolfenstein run, as well meeting many friends that I've previously only spoken to online. Thanks for making my first live GDQ a blast, everyone from Gyger to the Kingdom Hearts community
I should sleep.... but now that I saw subnautica coming up idk now
PC block hype!
Hey AGDQ here are 5 Bugs to beat Cancer. Also i would love to see a MegaMan11 Run we are so ahead cause all runners did such an awesome job. So if you have any Persons around there who are able to do it bringt it on ! HYPE!!
Huge shoutout to everyone involved in this amazing event. $1,000,000! Wow <3 let’s kick cancers butt in the butt!

Hyped to have some time to watch AGDQ! And I get the opportunity to donate? Double HYPE?! Good luck to all the runners and leave cancer in the dust!
Gotta nuke something.
Had to throw in a bit extra for that great Bioshock run. It really sits in a tier above all other shooters.
Good luck with your Überrun TheFunCanon and Bryonato Yeah Yeah uneven Numbers, Bry, I know.Is this Control or Wolfenstein? XDAnd this Donation obviously goes to "HEYO"
Here's 50 daughters (yes I remember)
somebody sneezed on screen, so i hope this bless you gets to you.
Once I realized that the Ashtray maze was up for control I had to donate again. Favorite game of 2019 for sure. Thank you for this wonderful event GDQ.
Bryonato, funcannon AND PROLIX? You know I had to donate #HOUSEREDFOOT
Definitely not gonna regret staying up this late tomorrow morning to watch my favorite speed runner Bryonato. Always a pleasure to see his runs and donate for a great cause! Good luck on the run! #HOUSEREDFOOT
Lovin' the Doom jams

Hi GDQ , Its as always insane to see how insanely fast All the runner run through the games... also put this towards Terra in Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep. lets be honest guys we have seen Aqua and Ventus way to many Times in Marathons ... we need to give Terra his time to shine aswell.
This Sunday is the 5 year anniversary of my daughter passing. Thank you GDQ for giving me something else to focus on this week week. I’m sure Ryleigh would love to be watching you with me. Good luck runners!
#DarkMage

So excited to get to see the Youngblood co-op speedrun at AGDQ and couldn't ask for a better duo to do it! Together we will beat Wolfenstein but more importantly beat cancer!
Long time watcher of GDQ events first time donator. I have class tomorrow, but can't help keep watching. Thanks for all you guys do, and let's fight to get rid of cancer!
Want to say We love you to our lovely sweet star
#HouseRedfoot It’s awesome to see two of my favorite runners playing a super fun game at AGDQ. Love donating to such a great cause while watching a great run!

Third year in a row watching gdq with my girlfriend, first year we are able to donate! My mom is almost 8 years cancer free so it’s grea to be able to donate to a cause so close to me! Keep up the great work
A present from my friends to you. Put this money towards the Ashtray Maze incentive in Control.
Tried to donate during the stellar ocarina run, but my keyboard was disassembled! Let's beat cancer together everyone!
Cancer sucks, have a friend's mum receiving treatment now. Best wishes for all of the people in the world fighting cancer. Let's go TheFuncannon and Bryonato! Also hi to Amyrlinn on the couch
This one is for gazzame! I know you gotta get up early tomorrow but I hope you're still watching. Keep it up GDQ!
Good luck and have fun Vi :)
Greetings from the back couch! Always great seeing cool co-op runs like this and Borderlands. Putting this towards the ashtray maze for Control - definitely the sickest part of the game. Also, AYO!
Gotta put in that regular donation. Go GDQ! Also, a One Mind cathegory incentive? That deserves some extra!
top tier commentary from Bry (as usual)! always love watching you and TFC run! Very excited to see you run Control later!! <3 #HOUSEREDFOOT
Greetings from Sweden!After several years I was finally able to take the whole week off to watch as much AGDQ as possible.Can't get enough of AGDQ!Love the work you do, keep it up!
Let’s get that 100% glitchless VVVVVV run so we can hear more of that sweet, sweet soundtrack
Let's get a train going for 140 all levels! Choo chooooooo
Not liking the ninja bonus games being added so late into the list of possible items to donate to. But none the less this 25 is going for Pokemon Blue
Love you Beej! Is this enough for a boop and a treat?!
Hey Prolix! No need to read this one (my name's tricky anyway!), but 1) I always enjoy your happiness on the mic <3, and 2) I appreciate the inclusivity of displaying preferred pronouns for those who choose to do so. It feels like it shouldn't matter - we're all here using made-up names in speedrunning fantasyland, but our identities are still valuable. Anywho, do tell everyone to maintain maximum awesomity! :)
Good luck to the cutest co-op partners of all time! Much love and punch those nazis! <3 #HouseRedfoot
.. it's for prizes.
Hey Bry, I was going to hold my donation until Control, but I've just got to help get us rockin' in the Ashtray Maze. Good luck and, "Eyyoo!"
Firstly I need to apologize to BloodThunder for missing the Bioshock run It Very early in England currently, it's great to see Youngblood at AGDQ being run by TFC and Bryonato who are both Awesome runners.[ I will donate an additional 5 dollars if bryonato says "you're awesome Judgy how about that?" after]
Bryon, I'm sorry you guys keep not getting the doggos, but that's okay, cuz you have the bestest darggo to go home to after GDQ!
Long time viewer, first time donator! GDQ is truly the friends we make along the way, as evidenced by Bry and TFC's great commentary and banter! Putting this towards a French-language Control run. AYOOO #HOUSEREDFOOT
run fast, run safe, greetings from ZA -- J
Had to up my donation because my noble hound Niko was just diagnosed with cancer today.
I remember playing the original Wolfenstein for hours and hours on end. I haven't played any other Wolfenstein title since but this co-op run might make me change that! Good luck runners.
As I Expected Bry ;)
Thank you to all the runners, announcers, all the people behind the scenes, and everyone who has donated! This event is amazing and means so much to me! Can I get a HYYPPPEE!?!?!?!
Hi bloodthunder hi everyone else good luck with the rest of the run
I LOVE YOU GLASSES GUY.From, your best friend (:#HOUSEREDFOOT
First time dono. Discovered speedrunning last year and made it my new years resolution to start speedrunning. Starting with My Friend Pedro with a friend tomorrow
Ayyo first time donating and so happy i could see Bryonato. Also the control run would be nothing without all the ayyo's and Bry don't forget to talk to pope!
To another great GDQ event! Big thanks to the runners, commentators, organizers, and staff.
Congrats to TFC & Bryonato on the new Wolfenstein Youngblood world record. Yup, I roughly timed it, that's a 3-minute world record folks!
This is my first GDQ watching at home since AGDQ 2018, and I miss all my friends but I'm having a great time seeing all these amazing runs with my newborn daughter Marnie, who would love to have the main character in the Pokémon X/Y run named after her. Shoutouts to the gamer hours hype squad! HONK
This speedrun matches 7 of the 9 preconditions for stimulating hype in humans. Thank you for speedrunning my favorite game, Subnautica, for a good cause!
Less than three
Fuck cancer.
I've been so hype for this Subnautica run all week
Hey! Long time viewer here tossing in a donation.hjönk hjönk
"so you notice im breaking these blocks a little bit quicker than normal. that is because you bind the scroll wheel to one of your action keys, each scroll is gonna count as multiple inputs of that action which is fantastic for playing this game. i can break these blocks real quick", cheers Salv
Long time viewer, first time dono. I'm hype for Salvner's run, his YouTube got me into Subnautica and he absolutely kills it. By the way, it might seem like I'm breaking these rocks rather quickly. That's because I've bound my scroll wheel to the action button, which is fantastic because usually to break and pick these rocks takes 4 clicks. This only works on high FPS. Good luck on the run, save some baby leviathans.... and maybe some frames too.
I have been a long time watcher and I just want to say you guys are amazing me and my wife watch you guys all the time and we are expecting are first child here soon
salvner, be epic as usual, swim with the current, and good teeth/nickel RNG with a greeting from South Africa -- Matya
I lost a very dear friend to cancer, she fought three different times and beat it twice. She lost her battle earlier last year. This is for you Liz, agdq saves lives, hopefully this saves someone's life in her name.
Thank you for hosting such a great event and shout out to my son Landon who I love very much.
Hey Salv, do you ever get tired of repeating yourself? I sure hope not, we're so proud of you! Have fun playing the game that is so perfect and has no glitches AT ALL. <3
I'm too tired to stay up anymore but let's go subnautica!
Have to donate for my 2018 game of the year. Let's hear it for Subnautica!
Holy Crap!!! its floppy hat girl, props to you! Its always fun spotting you in the crowd. Incentive is your choice. Keep on rocking!
Floppy hat girl!! I was wondering where you went when I didn't see you in the front row anymore! A question for you... When do you sleep? Do you sleep? Are you secretly a vampire?$5 more if you're secretly a vampire.
hello floppy hat girl. can the floppy hat cure cancer? please? thanks!
Long time watcher, firs- SECOND time donator. Subnautica was one of those games that I was expecting speedruns to be insane. Prove me right.
Lost multiple family members to cancer and I got a tumour removed last year. So thanks for doing this every year and greetings from Sweden.
Man do I love this week of chilling out and watching epic games being destroyed. H O N K
All the best on the runs! Keep it up :D
Lets beat cancer! Aleks get back to work
so everytime these dogs pick up a piece of metal there is a chance they drop a tooth. the chance is about 15%, and we basically need four of them by 8:20
I've had a couple of family members recently diagnosed with various forms of cancer. Let's kick cancer to the curb!
I'm scared of this game so I'm excited to see it played at my favorite event! Go flappy hat girl! <3
Greetings from germany. It's great to watch good content while at work. Good luck to all the runners and let's kick cancers ass and chew bubblegum. AND I'M ALL OUT OF BUBBLEGUM.
Subnautica is beautiful and strangely soothing, so what better run to watch while I get my baby girl back to sleep.
For many years I've been seeing clips from AGDQ but this year I get to watch this live! Amazing work guys! My grandparents died of cancer and it's super important for me to support cancer prevention when I can!
salvner, remember, 2679 is always the code, before you smash the keyboard -- JMatya
Good luck salvner! Hoping this donation will encourage Casper to bless the run.
Good luck guys in all your runs and cheers for raising so much money for such an important cause.
Hi salvner. You are the best speedrunner on that planet, I'm not even squidding
Watching for years now, but first time I donate. And now, since I am a frog and to prevent cancer:From at least one in the crowd, give me a "QUAAAK"Thanks!
Compelled to donate for one of my favorite recent games, Subnautica! Keep up the good work all!

"Motivational note. Salvner crash-landed in the deep oceans of 4546B, cured an ancient pandemic, and escaped in thirty-nine and a half minutes.If he can do all that, you can donate to prevent cancer."Let’s go for one Trillion dollars! Hype!
I love Subnautica. Thank you Unknown Worlds. And thank you, Salvner for running it.
Yeay...finally!!! Subnautica ftw!!!
I’m so happy to donate during SUBNAUTICA for two reasons: SUBNAUTICA was the first game I ever played (really), and I’m a nurse who lost their colleague to cancer and see it’s effects everyday. Thank you for helping us fight the good fight!
"Do good, die great"
Greetings from Germany. Also hello to the German Restream. :)
I lost my grandpa a few months ago to a very quick, aggressive cancer, and even though it isnt much, if I can keep another family from losing their loved one, I'll give what I can. Thank you all for what you do and good luck to the runners!
Been watching GDQ on YouTube since 2017, finally getting the change to see the stream and donate live. I love everything you do here. Keep up with the good deeds and fantastic runs. May RNGesus be on all the runners sides. <3
Been watching agdq since the beginning love the cause! Subnautica scared me like crazy when I first played it.
Here's five bucks to the most terrifying line in Subnautica: OXYGEN.
Wow a rare Salvner cam. Here's to good doggos and a kicking cancer's butt.
Staying up late to watch one of my favorite games from the last couple years: Subnautica. Good luck Salvner and bless RNG.
It'd be alterrable of me not to donate during my favourite game, and help beat this leviathan of a disease. Much love from Canada, we've got our peepers on you!
Hi salvner, so proud of you buddy, it's been great seeing you go from "hey I might try speedrunning" to "guess I'm at gdq now" so quick! Good luck pal, and from me & Chris - "GAME FOUR GAME FOUR GAME FOUR"
Best of luck Salvner!
Hi salv,Great to see you and Subnautica at GDQ!Have fun and may RNG bless your run!
Five dollars for every wreck without seaglide fragments 😬
Toss a coin to Prevent Cancer, oh valley of plenty. Oh valley of plenty.
Good Morning Night Owls! So excited to see Subnautica make it AGDQ. It even more amazing how much the runs have improved. Best of luck, ill be cheering!
I have loved watching all of AGDQ so far this week, and there is no way I was going to miss the run of my favorite game Subnautica! Lets beat cancer together! I do have a question for Salvner and those on the couch- please reenact your first encounter with being eaten by a reaper leviathan!
I've lost count how many times I've become fish food in Subnautica. Watching Salvner speedrun this game is very therapeutic. Good luck!
Water is cool
Cheers, Salvner for all your spectacular subnautica speedruns. 100% next year?
Today, my friend and colleague lost her second fight with cancer. I know this donation won’t bring her warm smile and positive energy back but I hope it will help keep more smiles going; like she would want. Thanks Christina, you will be missed.
Thanks for breaking one of the best games I've played in years.This donation is for Carl the Cuddlefish - who I stored in the Bio-reactor for safe keeping and haven't seen in awhile.
Love your positivity during this Speedrun of one of my favorite games. Keep it up and keep those doggos safe!
3+2=7 😂 $7 for that!What a lucky spawn point, can you save some luck for the rest of us? I have to be up I the morning but I've been looking forward to this most ^-^
AGDQ is always much fun to watch to watch. Seeing Subnautica for the first time and it's such a beautiful game. Excellent explanation by the runner. Donation goes to runner's choice.
Instead of paying your outstanding dept of trillion credits to Alterra you can pay it as a donation to pcf
Subnautica is such a peaceful ambiance of a game ive never even considered speedrunning in it. Absolutely fascinating!
Hey Salvner, don't forget to always go upstairs!
Hope all your underwater engineering is productive salvner! Have a great subnautica run!
Subnautica is one of my favorite games even though I'm terrified of the deep ocean and I refuse to believe that there is any biome besides the safe shallows. Good luck to the runner!
So glad to see Subnautica at AGDQ! Just had to donate during one of my favourite games in recent memory that devolved very rapidly from 'oh this game is so pretty and relaxing' to 'aaaa I hate the ocean!'
Subnautica has a special place in my heart, as it was a game that helped my girlfriend and I bond and become a couple. Good luck on the run Salvner!
I'm chronically ill and spend a lot of time in bed. Subnautica is my favorite game of all time and has brought me so much joy, and your run does too. Thank you guys for fighting for the health of others.
I met my girlfriend because of this game and we’re both cuddled up watching right now! Good luck on the run!
IT IS YOUR PRIME DIRECTIVE TO LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL FISH AND DONATE.IT IS YOUR PRIME DIRECTIVE TO LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL FISH AND DONATE.IT IS YOUR PRIME DIRECTIVE TO LOOK AT THIS BEAUTIFUL FISH AND DONATE.
Subnautica is one of my favorite games! Cook a bladderfish for me. Thanks for running it, Salvner!
Toss a coin to Subnautica, oh valley of plenty!
Ooooo, fishes! Also hi Rocket!
Hey Salvner! The run looks awesome, my girlfriend loves Subnautica, and is here watching the stream with me!Good up the great work, can I get a HYPE?!

Blub Blub.
Have to donate during my favorite game Subnautica! Good luck Salvner, here's hoping Casper blesses the run!
I was on the playtest team for Subnautica. I can see we missed a few bugs. But seriously, thank you so much for showcasing a game that had a lot of time and love put into it for such a wonderful cause. Keep up the amazing run and say hi to my boy Sammy for me!
Bless everyone of all these talented people who put in the time to make a event like these possible! Thank you GDQ and PCF! By the way remember to stay hydrated! ...just remind yourself even though it looks refreshing, this alien ocean isn't meant to drink.
Gday from Australia gdq! Absolutely loving this subnautica run. one of my favourite games. Good luck to all the runners this year and a huge shout out and thank you to everyone behind the scenes. Without you we wouldnt be here. Cheers.
Love that you call the stalkers 'doggos'. Good luck on the run!!
Spending the last few minutes of my birthday watching GDQ, but this donation is in honor of my mom who was diagnosed with cancer this past year. Thank you GDQ for all that you do to help an amazing cause.
Been watching for quite some time but first time donating. PS Subnatica is one of my favorite games
Hi Salvner, so cool to see you representing the Subnautica speedrunning community. Fingers and toes crossed for good nickel luck! We can cure the kharaa, now lets see if we can cure cancer!!!
Cool base man, but it would really tie it all in with a neon tiger shark poster. Maybe Lisa Frank? Keep up the great work and let's start a five dollar traina
Missed the Destiny 2 run but rewatching now so some donation is needed! Keep it up!
My fiancé and I have been watching AGDQ for the past 4 years together after he introduced me to when we first met. It is honestly the best thing he has ever done! I absolutely love AGDQ and everyone involved in it. We both have the week off from work and have done nothing but watch the amazing speedruns and ruin our sleeping patterns. Thanks for best event of the year and a much love to my love.
Cheers Salv. I'll donate another 25 if you nail the dolphin dive.
It's time to donate and throw in some bad ocean puns, so I think I'll wave around a few fishy jokes. Oh whale, it's better than just floundering around doing nothing. Do you think everyone will dislike the depth of these comments? Nautica chance.
 (Comment rejected)
Thanks to all the runners and crew and everyone in the audience and chat staying up through late night GDQ!
Salvner is moving so fast its making me seasick!
Hey salv, big fan of you and AGDQ. I lost a dear friend to cancer this last year and I am donating in her name so that someone else won't have to go through what we did. I will donate again if I get a good HONK from the audience. <3
Was looking forward to this all day. Thanks for running for us! Oh and don't forget to save <3
So proud of you, Salvner.x
I love Subnautica! I've never seen anyone so quick. Thanks for the cool tricks and good luck!
You guys are awesome and continue to surprise me year after year with the amazing speedruns you guys pull off. Please continue and remember, pet the dogs.
HONK!
Greetings from Germany! I postponed the start of my workday so I could watch SALVNER crush one of my favorite games! Good luck on the rest of the run!
Hey salvner, you only have three silver at home! Greetings from your chat, you're doing great.
Long-time viewer first-time donator (would have donated more if wasn't on a budget). Been watching Salvner's speedruns on Youtube since I've haven't been able to catch him live. As soon as I found out He was running at AGDQ I was determined to stay up and watch. Goodbye sleep schedule, hello Casper!! I also want to give a HUGE thanks to everyone donating, speedrunning, attending, and for coordinating these events. What you guys do here has an incredible impact on thousands of lives.
Hey buddy :3
Thank you AGQD for continuing to support such a great cause.
I loved Subnautica and definitely in my Top 3 in 2019. Love seeing it being run like that. Shoutout to my brothers Rizy and Burnz and all the awesome gaming memories we have. Good luck Salvner for the rest of the run.
Subnautica has been one of my favorite games over the past couple years. It's always great to fall back into it to chill out, and I couldn't wait to see it being run on AGDQ . Go fast, and go among the stars!
Awesome Subnautica run, shout outs to Casper and Kevin! And maybe Salvner as well.
Bananas rule.
You're a mad man! This speed run is excellent. Special shout out to yashy pashy and harashy
Pensez à vous hydrater ! #Tempetedesang

GYOO GOOOOO!!! #Subnautica
I'm going to bed... to lay down and eventually pass out while watching speedruns, but I want to wake up to a lot of VVVVV. So my 10 dollars are going towards 100% glitchless.
Thank you for a great event! Here is 50 bucks for a fine use.
Greetings from Aersia!
Long time viewer, first time donator. Good luck to all the runners and May de good RNG be with you.

Five dollar train for 140. Cause who doesn't want more gdq
5 year watcher, thank you for everything you do. Gonna stay up to make sure I can see the Touhou run! Never seen Touhou at GDQ before so I'm excited.
Loved the subnautica run, and thanks to AGDQ and chat for making it feel alot less lonely while working the graveyard shifts. Here's to a strong start for a more cancer free future!
Congrats Salvner on a great run, even when all the RNG was against you. I love Subnautica and love watching all your runs - thanks for everything you do!
Honk Honk
I wanted to donate during the Celeste Farewell run later today, as Celeste is one of my favorite games. Unfortunately I'll be on a flight during the run :( so I figured I would donate now. Good luck to all the runners at this amazing event!
Hi Agdq,i love you. Morning from france <3.
Good Luck on the run! shoutout to everyone backstage running the show. You guys are the unsung heroes!
Je lève mes bras pour donner l'énergie à Maman! Courage à tous les ambianceurs, commentateurs.#EniCeleste
Had to donate for a great subnautica run that's kept me up too late and that fantastic Luna Nights perler. Donation goes towards the Ashtray Maze, because it's the best thing Remedy's ever made.
Oooh, a Squidlit Plushie!
Indie block hype! Can't wait for The Sun and Moon, VVVVVV, and Celeste. Too bad we won't have a lot of time to hear their soundtrack. :)
Love GDQ, so excited for a Touhou game in the lineup tomorrow for a game even I have run! Best of luck to all the runners, and thank you everyone for the event and effort!
Hello from work. I currently can't watch but I hope everyone is having a blast during this event.Here's to more awesome runs and let's kick cancer in the butt \o/
First time watching GDQ, great stream, great cause. Good job everyone!
Christina was the name of my parents dear friend who lost her fight to cancer the year before I was born and is the namesake for my middle name. I know it's not the same Christina as the first donator but I can't not donate for her.
140, huh? I wonder if there's a convenient meme-y multiple of that...

Christina is the namesake for my middle name and also a good friend of my parents who passed away from cancer the year before I was born so I had to donate for naming chespin Christina.
Best of luck to you vi/o, show those arbitrary geometric shapes who's boss!
If only there could be a game where all the sounds are replaced by HONK.Announcer can decide what incentive this donation goes to.
140 is one of my favorite games of all times and it got me through my Level Design classes. Let's get to All Levels!
Putting this toward the 140 all levels incentive!Dedicating this donation to my mom; last year was rough for her having lost both her kidneys to cancer, but thankfully recent scans have been all clear! Good luck and have fun to all the runners! Let’s kick cancer straight to the moon

Good Event !!!#ParraPluie
But where's SmoothOperative?
In honor of my mother's recovery from breast cancer, and because today is her birthday, I felt it best to donate to the prevent cancer foundation. I've been a longtime viewer of GDQ, and every year is another year I feel so blessed to have my mother around in my life. Here's to another ten years of GDQ!
Hey V, good luck on your run, and shout out to the Limbo community. We'll return one of these days!
$5 for $5 because $5 is $5
This is my first time watching AGDQ and I never appreciated speedrunners until I watched these past few games. The talent is unreal and you are all amazing. I'm glad this money is going to a good cause and I hope everyone is having a wonderful day. You're all beautiful and no matter what challenges you may face, keep your head up!

This stream and cause are “Lit”. It would be nuclear if the front row and couch would do the wave and worth another $25 donation for me. “Honk!”
Let's kill cancer before it kills us!
Hi GDQ, I'm Seth. I'm 7 months old living in Sydney, Australia, and have been watching GDQs with my daddy my whole life. Sadly, just before I was born I lost my Aunty Jo to Melanoma. My daddy, mummy and I are glad to see such wonderful efforts going to fighting a scary disease. Daddy tells me that the Mario Maker race will be awesome, I just hope I can stay awake for the whole race, but bottles and naps are pretty irresistible. Play hard, nap hard!
I lost a good friend to cancer this year, I miss you Ted. Thank you to everyone at GDQ and all the good that has been done the last 10 years.
Squid, Squid Here I come
Staying home with my son to watch AGDQ today. He’s 6 and he already says he wants to be a speedrunner when he grows up. Thank you for 10 years of the best gaming has to offer. Love to all from Spain

Love GDQ, keep it up. Also donate for VVVVVV, i want to see both goals. And thumbs up for the bunny hat, got myself one as well! <3
See this game first time and I love it to watch! Great run, keep it up!
Agdq is keeping me company while I nurse my cold. thank you for all you do!
Fancy Pants!? Never thought I'd see one of these games in AGDQ! Played a lot of these games back in 2000s. Nice to see how far such a random game I found online has come
I'm an idiot who scheduled my winter holidays badly so I'm only now tuning in. Womp womp :( Cracking my donations open with a game that I never beat because I'm bad at video games, but that the runner is cracking right open for us. Go Newt! I'm super excited for this weekend, thank you for the amazing atmosphere.
Thanks to Newt and Helix for providing this wholesome run for all of the night owls out there. And of course thanks to everyone who makes AGDQ possible. This event helps make every year start off right!
I don't know why I'm up at 5am but I got to see a new World Record at GDQ! That's worth 25 bucks!
Let‘s speedrun the cure for cancer!
WORLD RECORD HYPEEEEEEEEEEEE
I thought I was done donating for the week, but a new world record is more than worth a few more dollars. Congratulations!
Like many, Fancy Pants was my childhood. Awesome to see it being played as fluently as it could sometimes feel. Also shoutout to helix for awesome couch commentary as well as that great Super Monkey Ball run earlier.
Poh la la !!! WR liiiiive HYPE :o #MarioLight
Speedrunning is very exciting.
Another $5 if the audience does the wave!
Des GG et Merci pour cette AGDQ ! #Goupix

Hello from London! Cancer is bad
Wanna see the Pokemon Tas
Greetings from the Paradox/White Wolf Community Management Team ❤️
My Fiance's uncle just got diagnosted with pancreatic cancer. He has not lost his spirit ever since he got diagnosed. Goes to show that you can always make the best out of any situation. Just wanted to help out as much as I can for a great cause!
Hello to the early morning crew! How about a 5 dollar train? Sending all the love from Hungary!
Cancer is bad. make it go away.
AGDQ is great entertainment, love you guys each one of you makes this possible! <3
Thanks again to the runners and crew that keep GDQ going around the clock!
This is my first donation to AGDQ but I've been watching since I was a teenager. My mammy fought multiple types of cancer all around her body from the age of 18 until she passed away at the age of 60 eleven years ago. Now that I'm 23 myself and struggle with my own illnesses, I can truly see how strong she was. She fought every day for nearly her entire life, but still lived it to the fullest. Never give up! Keep fighting!
I've been watching GDQ for a few years, but finally had a chance to donate. So excited to see Vampire The Masquerade: Bloodlines on the lineup!
Moved country this week so haven't caught as much as usual. But eager to donate, and let you all know how awesome you are for doing this every year. Shout out to the announcers for keeping the amazing job you've been don't. Incentive to announcers choice.
Shoutout to the Bloodlines 2 community on Discord, and its fantastic prince!
Love the work that you are doing! Keep it up with all your positive energy, HONK!
First time watching GDQ live and loving it! Can’t wait to see the Luna Nights run later and of course best of luck to the runners!
Valvin - you just soaked my Dollars for a good reason. It's okay!
Lost a lot of family members to cancer. Lets go kick its ass! also shout out to my good friend Korbinian!
Thank you for running this awesome game, shoutout to everyone in the Bloodlines Community!
Donate during my favorite game. I lost my mom to cancer last summer after a year of fighting against it. She was diagnosed with overial cancer the summer of 2018, She was almost cured from that when they found a new tumor in her stomach. I got informed that after that there was nothing they could do. After I lost my mom I also lost my job due to cutbacks. It all really sucked, but at least I had people arround me that kept me stable. I don't know where I'd be without them. Now its time to kick cancers ass ande I hope that at some point nobody has to see their parents witter and die from that garbagemonster that is cancer.
We should get these vampires some Chocolate Milk!
Make Vampires great again! Greetings from GER
this is my favorite videogame, really glad to see this being run at gdq again! also, malks best clan
Love to see VTM:Bloodlines in the lineup so much, I had to first-time donate. The moon is a mysterious mistress...Keep up the great work!
Love this game, so excited for Bloodlines 2. Happy speedrunning!
GDQ and VtM:B? Shut up and take my money!
Going in I didn't expect this run to make me bleed money, but I'm not(sferatu) worrying about it.
At work right now but watching this as I do things. Gotta support my boy Valvin. I remember the days you tried to teach me about speed running and I could not wrap my head around it at all. So proud you're at AGDQ man.
Greetings form Germany.
Greetings from Germany
It was cool to see those geodudes masquerading as enemies in this game
Geodudes? More like GeoDON'Ts. Seriously what are those things?
I’ve been missing work from a stomach bug. While in bed I’ve been watching a little GQD and it’s awesome what you guys are doing. It’s not much but it’s something.
Oh rats, my puns were dead on arrival. I found my puns in the LA sewers, so I guess that's why they sucked. I'm not sorry.
GANGREL represent
J'ai dû partir travailler pendant la run de #Subnautica (ce # passe tellement bien), du coup j'ai raté le WR de tout à l'heure :'( heureusement qu'il y a les VOD !
Can we get a Nutzlocke challenge next? RIP Gino+ (#diamondmon)
Late night $5 hype train, the crowd, the runners, the organizers are all killing it, and killing cancer! Much love from the UK! HHHHYYYYYYYPPPPPPE
Hello from Australia, Looking forward to the Touhou run, everyone keep up the hype, and thanks to everyone behind the scenes keeping the amazing event running smooth.
Love you guys. Kill Cancer.
So excited to see my brother's game Gato Roboto get bodied at AGDQ! I'm so proud of you, Cullen, and how far you've come in your dream of creating video games! Good luck to the runner, and let's prevent cancer!
Save the animals, Kill the cancer. Duh.
<3
It's been a fun week so far. GDQ always helps me unwind after (or sometimes during) a long day and the least I can do is donate a little bit each day to show my appreciation. Good cause, good runs, good vibes all around. Honk!
Touhou? Touhou!
I never thought that a game that I made would ever be run at a GDQ event. Thanks risky, shedd, sneaky, (and the rest of the runners) for making this happen and being patient with me during patches updates.
Been watching since 2013. Loving the event, shoutout to all the runners
Hi AGDQ, first time I can donate to this awesome event after years of viewing. Hoping to go next year and thanks to all for making this event possible
Hey Shedd, Risky and Sneaky. I am expecting Purrrfect runs from you guys and I cato wait to see who wins this cattastic race. Best greetings form the Ori speedrun Discord and of course greetings from germany :3
Hello from the front row!Watching the Gato Roboto run. Cats are okay.
Le cancer n'est pas un jeu vidéo mais on est tous un peu speedrunner quand on donne pour en voir plus rapidement la fin. Courage a toute l'équipe du frenchrestream. #coeurbleu
Good luck!
*Hold Until Tony Hawk Project 8 on Saturday morning if possible*.. Tony Hawk games will always get a donation from me. Fly.. fly.. like a Green Lantern.
I dedicate this donation to my grandfather who I lost to lung cancer back in June. In spirit of his memory as a railroader, I want to start a 5 to 30 dollar donation train!
Risky!! I hope you know you're awesome and an inspiration, you've been a patient and kind friend for me. I woke up just in time to try and get this donation out for you!
Nice run Shedd-Dad
So glad to be in a position to donate this year. Lost my mom to Cancer in September, and wish no one else would have to deal with that kind of loss. Keep up the amazing work!
Loving AGDQ2020 so far, another great year. Keep up the great work. :)
Pokemon Blue TAS you say?
Heard you were close to the upgrade to glitchless 100%, doing my part now!
ガーガー (That's HONK in Japanese) (Greetings from Japan)
Did someone say Pokemon Blue TAS? I'm awake, I'm awake, I swear! Let me get my wallet.
Great job guys keep it up.

Hi AGDQ, I cannot wait for the zelda randomizer run tomorrow but for now keep going strong! Greetings from the Netherlands
Had to donate during my favorite streamer's run! So happy we can work together to make cancer history. Donation goes to the Pokemon Blue bonus game, and I'll donate another $10 to Lizstar's choice if she yells "taste the rainbow" when she kills the final boss. #gobsquad
Let’s make a cancer free teenage robot life!!!!
HONK taste the rainbow HONK
A close friend of mine just got diagnosed with Bone Cancer. It is thanks to events like this that she even has a chance at survival. Thoughts and prayers to her and her family and thank you to everyone that has and will donate, to all the runners that make the event so entertaining, and all the staff that make all of it possible! Much love to you all!
Thank you to all of the staff and runners for the hard work. Great event for a great cause, let's stomp cancer like a goomba.
first time donating PogU
Thank you to all of the late night crew and runners, you guys are the real mvps
It's always great to catch a run by Lizstar - the amount of positivity and humour combined with the horribleness of the games really makes it an amazing experience. Donation goes to runner's choice
Skittles lore is so deep I had to donate another $5. Keep up the good work guys and keep the donations coming chat!
VVVVVV is one of my most cherished games, I love that there are people making beautiful pieces of art for it as well as speedrunning it! In case you can't tell, I want to win that cross-stitch...
Greetings from Antarctica! Does this now give you donations from every continent? It's a balmy -2 degree summer's day here at the Amundsen-Scott research base. I wish I could give more but I survive on grants myself. Thanks for heating things up for us down here with not a lot to do in our spare time. Good luck with this... game?...you're playing now (Darkened Skye). Thanks for all your great work raising cancer awareness!
Happy to have been able to donate more this GDQ. Good luck on the run Liz, look out for the Windows key
Hey, everyone. I'm so glad that Touhou: Luna Nights is being run. Let me tell you about my friend, Reimu Hakurei. She's the main star of Touhou, she's been in countless other games, and she does a great job kicking youkai butt for so little money and recognition. We can at least give her the honor on making her a playable character in Super Smash Bros. What does the runner think about my buddy Reimu being in Smash? Also, please donate to the AGDQ Shrine to help Reimu teach people how to dodge cancer like danmaku.
I thought I missed the awful games block?!
I though awful block was over
Greetings from Poland. So this is American response to polish The Witcher series of games right?
Man Morrowind looks so different from what I remember
...wait what? When she said skittles i didnt think she meant like actual skittles! love watching Liz run!
Love this cause, love Lizstar! Just one question, why does the rainbow taste like burning?
Pour mettre un terme à ce fléau qui emporte, sans prévenir, nos êtres les plus chers #Tempetedesang
Greetings from the back couch! Had to donate to support my friend Liz, playing the best game based off a partially gelatinous fruit based sugary confection. Let’s taste that rainbow, gamers!
Merci LFR pour votre couverture de l'évènement ! Keep going :) Eclairez-moi de votre plus belle #MarioLight Allez, un petit Control en français !Thanks GDQ for this event, every year, still here, still strong ! I hope we will beat cancer one day...
 (Comment rejected)
Here is 5 bucks for my favorite goblin girl. I'll also donate $5 more if you shout TASTE THE RAINBOW as you beat the final boss. Mich love from your favorite rabbit and selkie. #goblinsquad
Lizstar: MegaMan Dos and now this? why, just WHYYYYYY?!
This game is giving me huge Ultima IX vibes visually.Question for couch/liz - are there any branded games out there that are more expansive than this one?
Does Darkened Skye look like a mix of zelda and tomb raider or is it just me?
Misery and WHOA! There is no sadness in my heart this morning. I love this game so much and am SO excited for it to be broken beyond belief.
Anybody want one single Skittles?
Found out about Lizstar thanks to this marathon, and man am I glad I did. Donation goes to yisk and Katana ZERO Hard Mode because believe me, you NEED to see this.
The first time all week I've been able to watch GDQ live and it's the Skittles game at 5 AM. I wouldn't have it any other way.
The game crashed because Auth did not pass the Skittles(tm) check
I got here midway through the Darkest Skye run and needed at least 5 minutes before I could process that this is a skittles game
Want some Skye? ‘Course ya do!
Here's to us! You got the Skittles, and they're aaaaaall dead.
I have a question- was it a struggle to decide if Darkened Skye or Animorphs would headline Awful Block this year?
 (Comment rejected)
I want to see Super Gravitron Mode!
BACK TO LIFE, BACK TO REAAALITY! greetings to the runners (great game!) and best regards to isabelle, fabian and domino!
So that's what the Create Wizard spell does...Go Liz! Darkened Skye is a hilarious and charming game, and it's always fun to watch it played. Love supporting a great cause and watching awesome runs and awesome runners.
Lizstar can have little a Skittles, as a treatGood luck with the run and make cancer taste the rainbow!
Wait this game has Skittle materia?Skitt-eria?
I think the reason why Mars wouldn't want snakes in a Skittles game is because the word snake starts with the letter S and when they hiss its written down as a lot of S's, so maybe they didn't want people to associate the letter S which is on a skittle with the bad connotation of a snake.
I love Skittles! Taste the Rainbow!Shout out to survivors Lear and Hop. Let's beast mode Cancer!
Quoth the Liz: "I don't think anyone would want to play this after seeing me do it?"Me, literally five seconds earlier: "Honestly I kinda wanna try this one out."
Thanks for the amazing work and the great content.
This whole game is incredible, thank you for running it, Liz! Also shoutouts to all my friends on the back couch!
I can hop on this 'screaming taste the rainbow train' $5 more if she does! I haven't seen Lizstar 'stream' until right now. Very entertaining and for a good cause! Cheers!
Good luck to all the runners today!
That's two mornings in a row that I wake up to a run by Lizstar. I can't think of a better way to start my day <3
Is this the plot for Rise of Skywalker?
.
I remember the first time my Mom turned into skittles and then I ate the skittles and made out with my boyfriend. Ah, to be young again. What a fun run and great streamer!
Shoutout to dance dad and all the great runners!
First time I catch you live! I'm a trainee so sorry for "only" 20 buck...
My final #DancingDadDonation for the week, has been a great run so far but cant make the last few days, best of luck to all the next runners and thanks to all the previous ones for a great celebration of gaming!
Thanks AGDQ for all you've done over the years. You've basically created a new worldwide holiday!
I was going to donate this to the Hakurei Shrine, but this seems like a better cause.
Good morning GDQ! Always good to start the work day to Lizstar! Here's to another day of speedruns and raising money to fight cancer! Remember to stay hydrated, everyone!
*Honk* Bad goose! Get back here with my wallet! *Honk* Wait, you're making a donation? *Honk* Ok, you can hold the wallet... for now.
Hey Guys :NiHiYo: Artemis here from the TLN Speedrunning community. I've been running this game since it was only one stage in early access and man has this game been through a lot. So proud to see that it made it to GDQ! RBO is by far the most technical and interesting category so I'm glad it's on showcase. The whole TLN community is rooting for you Sean! Good luck! Don't forget your ABZ's! ALWAYS. BE. ZOOMIN!
As promised!
Gettin silly up in the dilly ya'll.
It's nice to see a Touhou game at GDQ. Good luck to the runner!
2who???
So excited to see Touhou Luna Nights being run, such an underrated game! Sakuya is the best!Now what was that thing that they were saying? Quack? No.. HONK! That's it!
I'm so excited to see vvvvvv run so here's money towards the gravitron. I still remember beating veni vidi vici for the first time during a chem eng lecture. It took everything not to cheer. Pay attention in class kids.
Gotta donate during during a Touhou game, especially one starring my girl Sakuya. This goes to naming the Castlevania: The Dracula X Chronicles file name after her.
Touhou is what allowed me to bond with my best friend in high school and this donation is for a good cause. donation goes to pet the cat.
Hey Sean! Scarlet Devil Mansion called, they wish you luck in your chainsaw hurling and collision breaking adventures. Show them Sakuya's true power, as you plow through everything in... reverse order? Huh. Well anyways, good luck and have fun. Also shoutouts to the Duck Tuck.
Hey guys, DMJ654 here of Gensokyo Radio donating for Touhou Luna Nights after staying up for hours after a long 12 hour shift. Cancer effects all fanbases and I am glad donate to help fight it. Might not be able to catch the full run, however I do challenge my other Podcast Hosts to match my donation if they are watching. Good luck guys, and remember, it is all the Moriya Shrines Fault.
We lost my father-in-law to brain cancer shortly after getting married last year. Being able to donate means alot and the work everyone puts in to make this event happening is wonderful. Thank you all for bringing gamers together for such a great cause.
Control ? En français ? j'achète ! #Goupix
It's been nearly 20 years since I lost my mom to colon cancer and 3 since my dad had surgery for it as well. Events like this give me hope for a better future.
Fumos on stream! FUMOS ON STREAM!!
I don't have much money right now, but I had to donate during a Touhou game. Remilia is the best! And let's fight cancer! Honk!
Thanks GDQ for everything you do!
Ayant perdu ma maman de cette m...e je ne peux que participer a tout ça !!!! #LonaLink
My dad was diagnosed with cancer this year. Seeing the outpouring of support from this community, as well as this incredible show of love for so many games both bring so much joy to me. Thank you for everything you're all doing. Warms my heart.
Had to wake up early to catch Touhou; never thought I'd see it at a GDQ!Thank you to the staff, the volunteers, the tech crew, the sponsors, and everyone involved!
Un saludo para SRE!
Let's go Sean! You got this!
Quoth The Raven: "Honk!!"
I look forward to the Touhou run every year, but this year I have to leave for the airport right as its starting. Good luck to the runner and I can't wait to watch this later! Also please start mentioning bonus game 5! We have a lot of work to get done for this one!
Moo.
Donating during one of my favourite Touhou fangames! Really hyped to see Touhou make an appearance at AGDQ! and by the way, Reimu for Smash!!!
Touhou Luna Nights hype! Donate now to the Hakurei Shrine to prevent cancer!
good luck to everyone battling illness in their family
Hey Everyone! I'm so happy to see one of my favorite games ran at GDQ, this is also the first game I've ever done a speedrun for, and it's a really good one. Good luck with the run Sean, and by the way, if you can Yellow Skip first try, I'll donate another 5.
Odd to play touhou lunar nights during the daytime
Donating $15 because I am 15/10 excited for the Celeste run. I even have my Madeline shirt on for the occasion! Let's go fast, fly high and beat cancer!
Bravo et merci LFR pour le travail que vous faites, on continue comme ça, bourrez les dons et bisous au meilleur tchat du monde #Lonalink
A shout out to my friend, Kat, who got me interested in Touhou and GDQ in the first place, and is an awesome person in general.
Go Jackson!
I lost my godfather because of cancer so thank all of you for chat you're doing.#CoeurBleu
Hello AGDQ. I got home just in time to catch the Touhou Luna Night run, and it made my day. As a fan of the serie, I couldn't allow myself to miss it. Go Sean, be fast.Also, thanks to everyone, runners, donors, nd all the staff behind the scene that makes this possible. You're all awesome, keep on fighting cancer.
Donating during the Touhou Luna Nights run because Remilia is MAI WAIFU!!!

Greetings from France ! Third time watching GDQ, I could not miss donating during a run of Touhou Luna Nights, now that I have an income to support it. Hope this small contribution will help beat Cancer once and for all.
I absolutely had to donate because I've never heard anyone say, "That's never happened before!" so happily during a GDQ!
eat some cheese
You've got this, go fast, destroy Cancer!
I've never seen Touhou Luna Nights before, and I just had to buy it! It only seems fair to donate to return the favour.
Cirno is the STRONGEST Touhou. Have my birthday money.
They asked me for my favorite Touhou and that's easy! It's Utsuho Reiuji .
For me, my favorite Touhou is Chen! HONK
Kanako best Touhou!
Since you asked so nicely, my favorite Touhou is Komachi! Shoutout to big scythe girls!
Favorite Touhou? Marissa. Because cute witch and laser beams!Donation goes to more TAS Block. Because cute robot and laser beams! Wait...
Hello AGDQ. My favourite Touhou character? Hmm that's a hard question but I think it's going to be Sukuna.
 (Comment rejected)
Koishi is the best touhou :3, clownpiece is cool too though
Touhou is back at GDQ! Thank you for bringing the banging tunes and impressive gameplay. Every Touhou is best, but Okuu is bestest!
Remilia is the prettiest touhou.
My favorite Touhou is Momiji Inubashiri.AWOOOOOO
Shameimaru Aya is my favorite touhou! She's a tengu girl and she's a cheerful news reporter who loves gossip! I love her design and she's so cute <3 Thanks for repping Touhou project, aka the best video game music series, at GDQ!
I did not know such a game for Touhou existed! It has been a joy to watch so far.As for my favorite character: that would be Flandre Scarlet. Nothing says cool like wings that don't make any sense!
Meiling and Marisa are best Touhous. Tei is pretty good, too.
Glad that was able to catch this run. I had to stop watching because I didn't know an extra stage existed. Best Touhou is Yuyuko!
 (Comment rejected)
God, I love this game, and I love this series. I've been staving off the urge to replay Imperishable Night for weeks now. Can't wait to sink my teeth back into TLN, though!
Suika, suika, tsurupetta suika!
My favorite Touhou is Remilia of course. Watching this run is quite fun, glad to donate to support a good cause too.
Hey! Remilia here, My favorite is my little sister Flandre ofcourse. Also question runner, can you remember the number of times you've eaten bread?
So excited to see Touhou Luna Nights being run! Fantastic job, Sean. I hope some day we'll get to see Touhou Double Focus run at a GDQ, so best girl Aya can have her day in the limelight.
It's very difficult to pick a favorite Touhou Project character, as they're all spectacular! However, Suika Ibuki exists, so it is an easy answer for me. Thank you!
Finally got to catch GDQ live and first time donating as a result. My favorite Touhou is Cirno. Because she's the strongest!
Woke up right when the run started. Was wait for this run all week. Koishi is best Touhou.
Oh boy, did someone say favorite Touhous? Shout out to everyone's true favorite rabbit, Tewi Inaba! (note: the w is silent. sorry, that's just how touhou works)
So you basically you throw chainsaws
Love from Germany
Hello again. I wasn't prepared to get my comment read, and it made me super happy. Anyway, fav Touhou? Yuyuko of course.

Where's the love for my girl Patchouli Knowledge? Ya'll have no culture.
Rocket Beans <3
Hey GDQ, greetings from Germany and thank you for the ton of fun and your awesome work! I'm a little bit nervous if we can reach the 3 million mark from the last event but there is still faith in the community! Keep the money rolling and fight together against cancer!
Shoutout to all the Touhou Plushes in the crowd, Cirno is the bestest Touhou in a world of best Touhous.
What this? A Touhou game at GDQ? I woke up super early to just to catch it. Please donate to the shrine so we can stop Cancer. My donation goes towards that Sakuya perler and that bonus game. Also, any Neps in chat?
Seeing you completely annihilate Luna Nights has opened my eyes. My favorite Touhou is Aunn Komano, and she should be your favorite too.
Hey all, it's the Herald of Spring here! Obviously my favorite touhou is myself, because winter is too cold for me! Keep being awesome. This goes to the VVVVVV Super Gravitron
Glad to see my favorite fan game ran at GDQ! And you know the Touhou characters andrew and kags? they always bother me!
mukyuu~
Hi Koakuma here, why am i not in the game?
Touhou has been one of my favourite franchises for so many years and I'm absolutely proud of the fandom for making amazing works like this game. I just finished playing this game today! It's so to have some more Touhou representation in gdq. Favourite Touhou is Momiji :)
Glad to know that this money will be used for a wonderful cause. Been enjoying the event so far this week. Keep up the good job!
Greetings from France! I keep coming back to VVVVVV as it is so fun to play, and I can't wait to watch the run, and hopefully the Super Gravitron as well! Let's make it happen!
Long time watcher and donor to this event. Unfortunately, I haven't had as much time to watch as I usually do but I had to stay up for the VVVVVV showing. My mother passed away from breast cancer that spread to her lymph nodes and from there the cancer infected most of her body. Thanks to advances in early detection, my sister has been able to get tested for specific genetics that were passed down and she is able to take the preventative measures to help reduce her chance of developing a similar infection. Events like these really help, and hopefully one day we wont have to worry about cancer anymore. Please put money toward runners choice.
My best friend is struggling with cancer, but she's too stubborn to let her wife make a donation on her behalf. So here's a donation to call out a certain kitten. We're wishing you all the best in your fight!
Thank you so much for playing my game on it's ten year anniversary! Good luck on the run!
Hello from Ireland!Shout outs to Spoolicus and Mediocrates in the crowd !
Been watching GDQ for a few years now, and it's become a real favourite. Keep up the good work all ❤️
I overslept and missed the Luna Nights run but at least I'm getting my money in for the Luna Nights perler raffle. Sending $16 because Sakuya's last name literally translates to 16 nights.
Lost my amazing mom to ovarian cancer around 10 years ago. Keep up the great work guys, you all are amazing.
Good luck mohoc! Terry and I are super hyped for this run. Thanks to everybody for supporting VVVVVV these past 10 years! Hope you're ready for today's surprises...
Happy to see VVVVVV again at gdq, greetings from Germany.
Had to donate because it's been a while since we've seen Touhou has been shown at GDQ.Stoked to see an amazing run even if I only could only catch the second half of it.Also Mokou best 2hu
$50 towards best girl.
This goes to the Gravitron
greetings from austria, i've been watching gdq for multiple years now and i'm happy to contribute to such a great cause. shoutouts to all the wonderful people working to make this marathon happen and also shoutouts to my lovely friends <3
That was an amazing run Sean. It was a blast doing commentary, and supporting such a good cause. Good luck to the rest of the runners.
This goes out to the couch of the Touhou run and also to the yellow platform
Lucario MUST be called Gino+!Greetings from Germany!
this is my first time at a GDQ and I’m loving it so much! Celeste was my first speedgame and means the world to me. Good luck flarebear!
As someone with cancer, this is definitely something that would push for my first ever donation. Keep it up guys
I just like seeing the number on the donation tracker going up and up and up. Let's keep climbing higher!
This megaman run by Andrew Gardikis is pretty sweet guys. Hopefully this Classic Games Done Quick things catches on.
sup
Donating for the VVVVVV Gravitron. VVVVVV is an awesome game so I had to donate. Also I like it when the commentator says VVVVVV. It's like a tongue twister. Say it with me: VVVVVV! VVVVVV!
Just discovered GDQ this week! Great speedrun communities, great cause; this is fantastic. Donating for VVVVVV Super Gravitron :D
Go mohoc!! :)

Had to donate during VVVVVV, such a great game with excellent music, and so much fun watching someone play it so skillfully. I died so many times playing this casually! Greetings from Sweden.
Here, have some $$$$$$ for VVVVVV
2020 hype
Had to donate for that incredible final time (20:20!) on VVVVVV. What a fantastic run.
Hey! I finally have the ability to donate and I just wanted to say that Chapter 9 of Celeste implies Madeline is either trans or a trans Ally which makes me feel wonderful as a trans girl. Thank you gdq for helping prevent cancer and can we get a TRANS RIGHTS from the crowd?
Donating for the Pokemon TAS run. Love everything TASbot related at GDQ, and Blue version holds a special place for me as my first Pokemon game. Blastoise for life!
Waited for the Celeste run, I still can't complete farewell... maybe this speed run will help me :)
Here's $20.20 for that amazing VVVVVV run. (Don't tell my boss that I'm watching at work)
Let's keep these donations up and beat last year!
VVVVVV gravitron!
I just want to see TASBot completely obliterate pokemon blue
Celeste HYPE. $5 donation train? Donation goes to runner's choice.
Here's some money for more great TAS runs and preventing that dumb cancer. Good luck to flarebear with the Celeste run!
Hey AGDQ, its your boy Theo! My time on Celeste Mountain changed my life, so I’m feeling #blessed to see Granny get a proper send-off today. Hey flare - super long shot, but if you run into Madeline up there on the moon or whatever, can you ask her to text me so I know she’s ok? Thanks!YOLOOOOOOOO!!
Celeste is one of my favorite games of all time, I just had to donate during this run. Let's climb that mountain!
Hello from back couch. Flare, show us what we can all achieve when we put our mind to it! Donation to runners choice. And remember, just breathe, and you can do this!
Excited for this Celeste run! I truly enjoy this game and this community and I’m so glad to watch live at my first AGDQ! Good luck to flarebear on this run! Shout outs to TGH for inspiring me to run this game!
PARDON : GG MohOOOOOOc !!!!!! <3La run de Celeste commentée par Millay <3 qui arrive KREYGASM#YomiCeleste
I am so ready to yell one last ORB!
Donating a dollar for each death in my first playthrough of Farewell. I love Celeste, I love the Celeste Speedrunning community, and I love the chance to support a wonderful charity.
I've been following GDQ since many years but now i have a bit of money, and they diagnosed me a sarcoma 2 month ago so its time i give money instead of just buying shirts !, especially for Celeste !!! Best to all runners, staff and the community :)
Murlrlrlrllrlrl #Tempetedesang #doubleWIN !
Thank you to all you've done GDQ! Keep going for that new high donation score! HYPE!
I can proudly say I finished Celeste Farewell faster than all my work colleagues...with a time of 5 hours 51 minutes. Seeing the level beat in sub-20 minutes? I'm not sure if I should be excited or just upset
Celeste is a very important game to me. From anxiety attacks to autistic meltdowns, the story (and the feather minigame) has made a big impact on my actual mental health. It only seems fair to return the favour whenever I see this masterpiece run at a GDQ event.
Good luck FlareBear!
I, for one, welcome our Porygon overlords. Put this toward the Pokemon Blue TAS run.
Another 20 for that Pokemon TAS! You can do this!
GET IN for the Pokemon TAS run!
Much love from myself and my community. We're donating during one of our favorite games for one of our favorite causes.Celeste has a very special place in our hearts and we're looking forward to watching it get broken! Keep up the awesome work everyone!Can I get a "HONK!" for Trans Pride?
Dear Gwen, i know you are far too young to enjoy all the wonderful runs with your parents at the moment..and maybe you are the reason your dad cant watch the stream 24/7 like the last 10 years.. but we are so happy you are here with us and we cant wait for the time we celebrate these marathons together some day. We love you. Mom and Dad.
TAS HYPEEEE
Had to donate for the Celeste Run, enjoying this awesome AGDQ
Had to donate during one of my most favorite games to come out in recent years, I cant wait to see this farewell run, best of luck!
5$ for the GDQ Logo Lapel Pin if avalable.
This time last year I began treatment for thyroid cancer. Watching GDQ and playing Celeste were a big comfort during a tough year. I'm happy to say that thanks to early detection, I'm now healthy and cancer free.Thank you for all that you do. Let's keep it up and beat cancer!
GDQ is always awesome to watch, keep up to good work and let's get that TASbot Run!
Good luck flarebear!Can't wait to see you rush through the DLC of one of my favourite games of last decade.<3
I'm so pumped for the Celeste run! I worked from home today to make sure I could watch it live. Good luck Flarebear and thanks AGDQ for all you do :-)
I played Celeste thanks to seeing it here. Hope you have a fantastic run!
Good luck on the run! Let's say Farewell to cancer!
Love watching AGDQ and especially the Celeste Speedrun. Awesome game! Good luck to the runner and greetings form Germany.
Shoutout to Flarebear for being an inspirational runner, I don't think I'd be where I'm at today in Celeste running without him. Can't wait to watch you destroy Farewell.
Donating for the best DLC and best soundtrack of 2019. The whole Matt Makes Games team and Lena Raine killed it with Farewell. Good luck Flarebear!
Had to donate during a beautiful game that brings awareness to a real issue thank you Flarebear_SR for running the game. Thank you GDQ staff, and lets get that pokemon blue TAS going!
Always amazing to see things I've worked on run at GDQ! Here's to an amazing Farewell run, and big love to all the Celeste runners (climbers?) out there! There's no "hey YAH" in the run this year, but can we get a big "HEY YAH?" Thanks <3
Hello, long time watcher first time doner; i would like to greet all the staff for all the effort they put into creating this kind of amazing event! LET'S BEAT CANCER TOGHETER
Donating during the Indie block, as Indie games mean a lot to me. I could not skip on missing these runs even while I am at work. Thanks for the great runs, and putting this towards the Pokemon Blue run.
As someone who suffers from having panic attacks gotta donate during Celeste! Best of luck Flarebear!p.s. let's get that bonus Pokemon Blue run happening!
I am watching FlarebearSR.
Celeste is one of my favourite games in terms of gameplay, story, and music, and speedruns of this game are awe-inspiring!
Good luck flarebear! It's so exciting to see Chapter 9 at this awesome event :)
Excited to see Celeste back at AGDQ. Saw the run last year and was instantly hooked.
The amount of this donation is equal to my death count to beat Farewell.Good luck to all runners, and thanks to all people who made this awesome event possible.
good luck on the run flarebear! celeste is a game that means a lot to me, always love seeing it run at gdq.
J'avais oublié de voter pour André, notre légende internationale. Le saviez vous ? André le Géant avait bu 56L de bière dans un bar avant de s'endormir. Vu son poids, personne n'a pu le porter et ses copains ont posé la bache du piano sur lui et l'ont laissé dormir.

Celeste HypeTout ça pour des fraises
I woke up earlier than expected this morning, just to hear my last donation comment read. It must be a sign to donate more! Let's meet that pokemon Blue incentive!
I'm dedicating this donation to my best friend whose mom got sick recently. She introduced Celeste to me at a very low point in my life. This game and her love helped me get through it and I'm forever grateful for that. Lots of love to Celeste devs, community and speedrunners of course !
Celeste is the game that I just could not stop playing. So glad to see this final chapter in AGDQ. Here's some cash towards that Pokemon Blue TASBot run. Moon Berry hype?!
I didn't pick up Celeste until last year, but it quickly became one of my favorite and best games I played in 2019. I immediately dug through the backlog of Celeste runs from previous GDQ's and can't wait to watch this run of Farewell live. Good luck flarebear!
I'm so glad to have Celeste here in this marathon again, now only if I could beat Farewell myself.
Good luck runners at GDQ, This Celeste run is beautiful, Flarebear is wild good! Let’s Crush cancer, HONK!
So glad to be donating during Celeste, a game that genuinely changed my life. Amazed by the skill level on display here — some of these individual screens here took me a week to get through. Thanks for all you do!
Morning AGDQ! can't watch right now but hope things are going great. HONK~
Donating during one of my favorite games of all time and one of the most impactful games I have every played. Love to see it speedrun and thanks to Matt for making such an awesome game. Keep it up Flarebear!
The last time I watched a Celeste run, people were yelling "ORB!" a lot more...here's for the Pokemon Blue run and preventing more heartbreaking cancer stories.
Honk honk honk, honk honk. Honk honk honk honk. Honk honk. Honk honk honk honk honk honk honk honk honk honk. #honk
Boing!
Little test for a big donation coming up :D
Come on, people! We need that TASbot Plays Pokemon Blue run! We've only got about 9 hours left!
<3
It's always crazy to watch Celeste at GDQ. Seeing all these crazy strats and skills is amazing.
I just lost my cat to cancer this week and AGDQ is helping me keep it together. Keep going everyone.
Shortly before my birthday last year, my mother's cancer returned after 4 and a half years. I got myself Celeste in preparation of long days in doctors' offices with her. I climbed to the summit day by day in the waiting room outside her radiation treatments. No time seemed more fitting to donate than now. My mom is still climbing to her summit with chemotherapy, but Celeste inspired me to keep having hope that mountains are climbable. Good luck to anyone else on this mountain, patients and caretakers alike.
i just got call that my cancer hasnt spread. Ive been watching to guys all week and im glad you guys are doing this i love you all
Awoo!
HONK if you hate cancer
Celeste says trans rights!
Here's 1 cent for every death in my blind play of Farewell. Teej, YP and Flarebear, thank you for showing us all how it's done. Donation goes to Flare's choice.

Coucou le French Restream ! toujours autant de plaisir de vous regarder depuis déjà plusieurs années, ça me tien a coeur car j'ai perdu mon père a cause du cancer.Toujours un travail super des commentateurs et le reste du staff qui ont le coeur sur la main ! Gros bisous à vous.#Subnautica
had to donate during one of my favorite games of all time (Celeste)
Sadly I can't donate as much as I usually do, but Pokemon Blue NSC was what first got me into speedrunning, so I really want to see TASbot demolish it.
Catch me if you can Madeline-- wait whoa calm down!Also: Squawk!
i just had to donate for this AMAZING run of celeste, i only recently discovered and finished this game so seeing the final chapter be beaten like this is so cool. shoutouts to all the wonderful people working for this great marathon and shoutouts to my lovely friends <3
Donating for the pac man block - good luck to teapartycthulu on CE DX! one of my favourite games :)
Let's get that Pokemon Blue TAS run met!
Didn't contribute to a group donation on time because I'm an airhead, but this is in honour of a young member of our community who passed away last month. Her name was Morning Glory. Every effort against cancer matters. <3
Had to donate during this amazing Celeste run. I loved the original game and it's just bananas to see these levels taken apart like flarebear is doing. Awesome job!
In December, my Uncle unfortunately lost his battle with cancer. He had been battling it for a few years and it was painful to see him slowly deteriorate. Hopefully this money can go towards saving someone else from going through the same situation.Keep up the great work everyone.
Flarebear. Wow.
That Celeste run was just unbelievable. I held my breath for the longest time at the end. Just madness! This 100 go to Pokémon tas!
Hello AGDQ !Alaways a great event, and awesome stuff from the runners and all the people involved. I hope this event will go on for many and many years.By the way, a Pokemon Blue TAS by TASBot ? Just shut up and take my money.PS: HONK !
I was going to donate during Celeste, but I was just sitting there stunned. Take my money, and thanks for doing such an amazing job on such an amazing game.
Celeste and speedrunning it has had a profound impact on my life. Thanks to GDQ, EXOK Games, and the runners :D
Celeste was a favorite game of our good friend Morning Glory, who lost her battle with cancer last December. She was the kind of person who never stopped climbing and would not give up the fight no matter what her health said. We are watching and donating to GDQ just as she would be if she were still here with us. Let us scale this mountain with research and early prevention so that others can someday see the top. Thank you for putting on this incredible event.
We've got time to grind out this Pokemon Blue incentive. I know yesterday felt brutal for incentives, but we've got this!
That was a beautiful Celeste run. Good job flarebear!
Mind blowing run: amazing game and super talented runner! Easily the best run of the year! Thanks for everything you do to fight cancer and for delighting us twice a year <3
Celeste was so amazing! I saw this game on GDQ for the first time and after I got it I was hooked. It's the first game I've considered speedrunning.
More Pokemon and more GDQ!
I forgot I was planning on donating during the Celeste run. It was so tense, I was way pass the edge of my seat. Now I need to complete if myself.
With the WWW run... (that's what it's called, right? Or is my TV blurry?)... the Celeste run, and the Pac Man runs as well, this is already one of my all-time favorite days on GDQ. Great job to the GDQ staff and everybody participating, and here's to another million in donations!

Shout out to my coworker Gene for watching from our office! Get back to work.
Thanks everyone for another great AGDQ, keep up the good work!
We need more Pokémon. We need more TAS Bot. Why not both together?

Congratulations to flarebear on that mindblowing Farewell run! Thanks for freeing that bird, and helping free the world from cancer!

This is for the guy in the audience that drums along to every song during the breaks
3 Pokemon games in one AGDQ? Sign me up. I wonder what that Blue TAS run will look like.
It's too early for clever comments.
I've played enough Pac-Man Championship to know I'm terrible at it, and I'm looking forward to seeing speedrunners absolutely demolish it! Let's get more TASbot.
Wanted to donate after the incredible Celeste: Farewell run. Celeste was my favorite game of 2018 and is in my top 5 of all time. Shoutouts to the Cincinnati fighting game, Killer Queen, and swing dancing communities, and also to my friends who have lost loved ones to cancer, including Austin and Sebastian.
Big shout out to the attendee who set up those Fumos during the Touhou Run. My donation goes towards naming the main character in Pokemon X and Y Cirno.
Hey gdq first time tuning and live, got really sick from a stomach bug and had to call into work thank you for entertaining me while I'm sickCould I get a "get well soon Panda" from the crowd?

I have fond memories of playing the Ms. Pac-man arcade machine when I was younger. Looking forward to the Pac-man and Pokemon block!
Hi Tpcuthulus Sister here! Im so proud of you ♡ good luck and kill all the animals.... wait its Eat all the ghost isnt it ;)
GDQ made up time?! Wanted to donate during Celeste, but I still managed to catch the end of a crazy run! TGH and TASBot's runs at GDQ were what originally got me to buy this amazing, beautiful game, and it warms my heart every time I see it included on the schedule.
Just throwing a pokeball to make the Pokemon Blue run happen. Still thanks for all the runners and the couch. #PokeLou
Had to donate during TPCs pac-man run. Shoutout to him & all the MFH crew. While I end up as a viewer much more than a racer, I still feel welcome. Now let’s see some new gold splits!
Good luck to TPC... DX is best pacman
Long time watcher, first time donating. To all the staff, runners, and contributors: keep up the great work, cancer has no place amongst us. Put this toward the pkmn blue TAS run, if its pkmn related, i want to see it!
Hey guys just want to say screw cancer, lost my great uncle to cancer a few years ago and my family is susceptible to getting cancer. Love what you guys are doing here and put this toward the Pokemon Blue run.
I was so hooked up in the Celeste run I couldn't even stop to donate!Feels incredible to see someone speedrun something I couldn't even casually beat
As a kid my orthodontist had a Pac-man arcade cabinet so I must have been one of the only kids who would beg to go to the dentist early. Can't wait to watch these pac-man games go down fast. Love GDQ, big thanks to all runners, volunteers, and staff #bringbackkeizandfeas
Love AGDQ, and have been watching for years. Donating to our TASbot computer overlords and (best Hulk Hogan voice) Whatcha gonna do brother, when the thousands of dots of PacManiacs, run wild on you!
It's sad we only have a couple more days left in the event. It has been a wild ride none the less!! It has been a meme filled week HONK!! Can't wait to see all the runs I couldn't catch during the week. This is a great cause, a great community, and amazing event. Donation goes to runners choice.

*WAKAWAKAWAKA INTENSIFIES*
hi TPC, Roar, Alpha, Niko and all my MFH fam. i cannot stay to watch the whole run, but time to get my donation in, GL i'm happy to see you doing this live at this event!
Here, have 10 English pounds in recognition of the stirling efforts being put in by all the fine folks involved in this 'excellent diversions performed with alacrity' marathon. I've enjoyed many of the feats on display, but that final part of Celeste ble my tiny British mind. The skills. The stories. The inspiration! The fact that this also goes towards the universal and wonderful cause of curing cancer is icing on the cake: it is always worthwhile to support excellence, an amazing community and the showcase of amazing games and gamers. Keep up the incredible work, and make that Pokémon blue TAS a reality.
Montrons comme André que la communauté française est capable de déplacer des montagnes en remportant cette incentive et surtout gardez la pêche !#Squidt
Heres a few bucks for the Pokemon Blue TAS run. Congratulations everyone on another great agdq!

My jaw dropped when I saw that there would be a GBA Pac-Man Arrangement run here at AGDQ 2020, Pac-Man Collection was my first-ever GameBoy Advance game, and I spent hours playing Arrangement in my early childhood.

G'day from Australia! 3am here. Spent a lot of my childhood playing Pokemon thanks to my Mum, she passed from cancer in 2016. Thoughts to all those battling and special thanks to the broadcast and event teams who make this all possible.
Year ago cancer took my mother away and even though she lost her fight I hope that other people have the possibility of victory. Thank you all for your great work and good luck to the runners!
That Pac-man arrangement run was insane!! Way to go Joester! Money towards Pokemon Blue TAS, really hoping to see that tonight

PS. special shoutout to the canadian longitudinal study on aging for existing,
I've been watching GDQ speedruns on YouTube for years, but I've never managed to actually catch anything live. But this year I got so, SO lucky - not only is it happening, but I magically managed not to miss one of my favourite runs. As a lifelong Pokemon fan, I'm thrilled to be watching my first live speedrun of it! Thanks to all of you for what you do.
Good luck on the run Wartab! Also, shoutouts to my boys Araya and Dolaney on the back back couch.Also, if you manage to find (and catch) a shiny, I will donate another $50
Go Chespin, Go!
I've always loved Pokemon speedruns. Good luck, WARTAB!I lost my dad to brain cancer 2 years ago. My fondest memories were playing video games with him after school, so hopefully, this small donation can continue his legacy and prevent anyone else from having to go through the same experience.
Hey Wartab, DralZ here!GL on the run, I'm sure the RNG will be in your favour! What a couch too! Such a collection of speedrunning talent and hey Keiz is there too!Put this to runners choice.HONK.

Upping my usual Pokémon donation in honour of my colleague, and my PhD supervisor's father, who both lost their battle with cancer last Spring, and for my study abroad classmate, who I recently learned has been fighting her own battle against Hodgkin lymphoma. My favourite Pokémon is Charizard, but I figured I could afford to donate more than $6, so I put another 6 on the end.Thank you GDQ and PCF for your amazing work!
Don't have as much to donate this year, so $15 for Beedrill, the best jerk Pokemon, I guess? Best luck to all the runners and thanks to all the commentators and staff!
I can't believe Haulucha wasn't one of the name options! Put this towards good Hawlucha luck, the Blue TAS and YeetNed for the Wind Waker filename.

Hello AGDQ! Being a Pokemon fan for almost the amount of time the game has been in the west, seeing all the runs of Pokemon games being broken during the GDQ events is always entertaining! It would be a real shame if we didn't get the TASbot to play a Pokemon game today! Shoutout to my shiny Honedge that hatched in 407 eggs!
Long time viewer, first time viewer!
"poke...man"? Never heard of it, but this looks like a nice little Animorphs clone! Good luck to the runners, putting this towards the TAS run.
Long time watcher, first time donator! Looking forward to the Pokemon Blue TAS! Let's get that incentive people!

Had to donate for the crowd singing during the gym battle. Go Quacklin', be the very best!
The Mega Man block is always my favorite block because it was the first speedrun that I watched and it will always hold a special place in my heart. Can't wait to see all of the Mega Man action!!!
Donation for the crowd's rendition of the undisputed most hype gym theme in the history of Pokemon
 (Comment rejected)
Let's get that Pokemon Blue TAS run!
Watching GDQ has kept me from being bored while recovering from foot surgery. Money towards the Pokémon Blue NSC TAS run, cause gotta catch at least a few of 'em
Eddaket on the couch forced me to watch this, so while I'm watching, why not donate for the cause. Best of luck wartab, you got this.Donation goes to wartab's choice of TAS-block bonus game
Merci beaucoup à tous (commentateurs, ambianceurs, chateurs, runneurs). Vous êtes géniaux. Des bisous à tous. #MarioLight
Hello from the audience! Another pokemon game, another pokedex donation train! 214 for a far better bug then any of Viola's, Heracross!
Let's make this Pokémon Blue run happen! Donating for my boy Keiz who always makes the best runs and couches! Love you bro <3
Gen 1 is the most broken Pokemon Generation. As many know, your critical chance is based on your Pokemon's speed, and Focus Energy actually halves your chance for a Critical Hit. However, not as many know that Critical Hits ignore every stat change, so getting a crit after setting up is worthless.Anyway, let's play Pokemon Blue! That game has nothing wrong with it at all!
Premier don ! Merci pour l'accompagnement cette semaine pendant le taff. Merci LFR pour tout <3Bourrez ! #Tempetedesang

Hi everyone.First of all, Keiz, Fennekin is adorable and sweet and you can't convince me otherwise.But on to my real question, how much do we need to raise to unlock that secret haircut incentive?Donation goes to runner's choice!
More TAS, more FUN - HAAIPP!
I just woke up for this run! Been looking forward to seeing my favorite Gen get busted. I don't have the gusto to donate for my favorite Pokemon, so this one goes to the Kalos dex number 50, Gyrados.
I had to donate after the crowd's antics during the gym battle, and the runner's opinion on Cyndaquil.
My father passed away from cancer a year ago to the day. Seeing the speedrunning community rally around this great cause is a welcome glimmer of hope at a time like this.Pokemon runs are always among my favorites, so this goes towards the Blue NSC incentive.
Hoooonk!
Pokémon is always a fun run to see at GDQ; let's get some more in and see TASBot break Blue horribly!!!
Bravo à toute l'équipe du restream pour vos efforts. #mariolight

Greetings from Liechtenstein (which is a country that exists!).Such a great, wholesome event this is, AGDQ is always a great time of the year! Shoutout to my brothers Tobias and Niklas, with whom I shared many hours 3-player-co-opping The Secret of Mana. It was quite the struggle to convince our parents to buy a 3-player adaptor for just that game. Many fond memories!

Hey Wartab, GearMax here, so happy to see you run after you randomly appeared in my stream one day on my first ever speedrun attempt, having a runner like you there as I tried my hand at this crazy profession made me so excited to keep trying and get better at running. Good luck, may the RNG fall in your favor, and I hope to be good enough to see you there one day! Also throw this 25 towards that Blue run!

Here's $101 for one of my favorite Pokémon, Electrode!
GDQ has been such a wholesome part of my life. My dad was recently diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer so this cause has become even more important to me. A big thank you to all the staff and runners for all that you do.
Friendly reminder that Keizaron has a very entertaining Jynx cry imitation...
Donating $133 for my favorite multi-evolution pokemon, Eevee!
Pokemon is my favorite game series and this event means so much to me. Thanks for helping me get through hard times!
I need that Pokemon Blue TAS!
You explained IVs; however, please explain, EVs, Hidden Abilities, Nature, Held Items and different move priorities. OH... and keep up the great run!!!
I'll throw a little more in if Wartab and the couch admit that Fennekin is the best XY starter. :)
Please put this towards the runners choice.
Hello there, and good Eevee-ning from Berlin. So, this may be a Weedle bit Farfetch’d and a bit Onyx-pected, but I saw my Goldeen opportunity and had to Steelix the spotlight. I hope the run goes Beautifly and you don’t end up Choking. Okay I’m gonna close my Meowth now. But can I get Seel of approval?
Oh are we doing donations for favorite Pokemon? Well, considering this game was the one that introduced the Fairy type, this feels appropriate! I don't have $700 to donate so hopefully this will suffice to show my love for #700: Sylveon!!
I have to wonder, what do cats sound like in French?
My grandmother beat cancer a few years ago, but the scare of her condition still ticks with me to this day. Additionally keiz and his community have been a great help in my fight with mental illness, and I want to thank them for their love. #bringbackkeizandfeasagain
Long time watcher first time donator here... yeah that's getting old. Anyways I'm very happy that I can finally donate and contribute to this wonderful event and the great cause, especially during such a great speedrun of one of my favorite game series of all time. Thank you to all the runners and staff that make all of this possible!!
I've been watching GDQ for years and I'm finally in a position to donate. I can't wait to see you all break more games of my childhood and helping to beat cancer!
7 Dollar for the best Starter Squirtle. Sorry 54 for the best Pokémon over all (Psyduck) where to much. Can you pronounce them in German? Schiggy & Enton. Greet and why don't we kill the animals any more. #Hype
Please pet the Pokémon!
High five to AGDQ for support the fight against cancer. Bulbasaur is my forever darling Pokémon. But it's definitely more worth than 1 dollar. Love from Germany ❤️
AGDQ is the best!! In the spirit of giving, we have brought our University friends together for our videogame and bord game marathon again. Stopped in to say hi! Hello Ed, Callum and Kate!!
Et voici mon dernier don de 5 dols qui me permet de rejoindre l'élite, que dis-je le panthéon du panier garni. Merci infiniment au FrenchRestream, vous êtes beau ! #zhtSonic (@SyllaxosFR)

This has been my first year watching AGDQ and it's already become my favorite birthday event! Twenty-five dollars for our Poster Pokémon Pikachu!Thank you for continuing to fight and being the heroes for all of us!
Hi! I'm 7 and I've been saving my money from the tooth fairy to donate to the Pokemon run because I love pokemon and I hate cancer. Put this money to the runners choice. My parents will donate too if you can get the crowd to talk like Marshtomp.
Yo, Snorlax owns in this game!
Thank you, Keiz!
Today marks a year since I started my cancer treatments. I just wanted to wish good luck on the pokemon speedrun and give a little to a farfetch'd pet!
For my favorite grass type starter, Snivy.
Just had to donate for one of my favourite pokemon generations. Good luck to Wartab, and let's prevent cancer!
Fennekin is the best. Maybe not in skill, maybe not in power, but in adorableness.
Pokédex donations is cheap for me, but not very cheritable, so here's a dollar for every year Bulbasaur has been my favorite
Shoutouts to wartab, hardest working man in Pokemon Speedrunning. If you know your pokedex, and you've watched a Gen 7 WT Race, you may know what's coming next: MYYYYYYY NEEEEEEEECK! Best of luck!
Jynx is scary.

Jumping on the $5 train with $15!
You though this was a donation for catching Raikou, but it was me, DIO!!!!! keizaron can never escape my grasp.
Just because my mom would yell at me for playing Pokemon Yellow under the covers until 1am when I was a kid, doesn't mean she won't appreciate me donating to a Pokemon speedrun to help people get the same breast cancer screening she got. Love ya mom! Glad you got early detection, and I promise I'll stop playing Pokemon so late (just kidding, I was up with Shield all last night oops)
Huge shoutout and all my love to the production crew for this event, you all are incredible! GG! Also this donation goes toward the pokemon blue TAS .
Praise the lord Helix!And keep up the good work!
HAIL HELIX!!
Loving this Pokemon run! Here is $15 plus 131 pennies for my favorite sea ferrying boy Lapras!
good luck on your run, wartab!glad I am part of the PSR community myself - so many nice, helpful and interesting people!X/Y was one of my favourite generations in casual playthroughs.speedrun-wise i don't know much yet, since I prefer Gen 1 & 2 glitched runs :Dseeing pokemon runs at marathons like the GDQ events is what got me into speedrunning them myself - so kudos to every pokemon runner out there!and how could my donation not go to the Blue NSC TAS incentive as a (former) Blue NSC runner :D
Hope you all have enough Coffee in store otherwise Pulse will empty it all ^^
Magnezone is my fav, but I can't afford the full $462, so here's a tenth of it.

Hello from a Game Company in Canada! Some of us have been watching the runs all week, and we felt like Pokemon was a nice time to donate since it's one of our favorite game! Congrats on all the runs, and especially to Wartab!Also, let's get that Pokemon Blue run!
Much love to all. Lets get that Blue TAS run.
Didn't know when I'd donate this year, until I saw the pokéboys doing their thing! Thanks for the good stuff. Also, you might want to check your WiFi
Andre the Giant was a pro wrestling legend born and raised in France. He's remembered fondly by many fans as a larger than life figure in the ring, or Fezzik in The Princess Bride.

Another brilliant and entertaining event. I've been watching for 7 years from the UK, and GDQ has become highlight weeks of my year, thank you again for this.Now, let us get this pokemon blue TAS incentive met!!
I love to start the term watching AGDQ! Thanks to all the amazing runners!
Hello GDQ, first time donator but I have watched the event since 2013. Gotta ask for that Lugia cry from Keiz!
Long time watcher first time donating. It’s been a long week but I get excited this time of year and during the summer. Missed a few runs because of work and sleep. But I did get to see OOT which is my all time favorite game, watching Pokémon and I love when Keiz is on the couch or running. I’ve had family pass away from cancer and my great grandma is battling cancer now and has a positive outcome and just for context she’s in her 80’s and has already beaten colon cancer, and late last year my step mom beat ovarian cancer. Good luck to the rest of the runners and thank you everyone from donators to staff, to runners and commentators for bringing joy to millions of people every year. Let’s see if we can get a donation train started for the Pokémon blur TAS run
Clap!!!
I that keys here? Watching a game about animals? Hmmm... are we getting Animorph DOS next?
I remember Pokémon X as much from watching a friend play it as going through it myself, so watching this run is oddly nostalgic. Keep it up - honk!!
Feed that quacky boi!!!
$50 to shout out the best Pokémon, Gengar and the Gastly gang. #VapeBabies
$43 for the BEST Pokémon; number 43 Oddish! Don’t @ meDonation to RunnrsChoice

Had to donate after that amazingly clutch Hawlucha capture and an overall incredibly entertaining run so far! (special mention to the crowd singing the Sword and Shield gym theme!) 280 dimes after the dex number of my favorite pokemon Ralts, and since it has a positively beautiful blue shiny, let's put this towards the Pokemon Blue TAS!
Donating $702 for the dex number of our favorite Pokemon: Dedenne!Thanks for all of the wonderful runs this year!
All hail barbSouls. Praise the sun!
Keep up the good work. We are very proud of all of you! Thank you.

As a thanks for naming a Pokemon after me I thought it was a good time to donate. This is going towards best girl Aqua for tomorrows Kingdom Hearts run. Good luck to all the runners. Keep going fast!!
I wasn't planning to donate this week (I'll save up for SGDQ ;)), but the runner, couch, host _and_ audience for this run are all so much fun!!
BLUE BLUE BLUE BLUE
Love the pokemon games and community. Thanks for another showing at GDQ. This one goes to runners choice.
What an amazing event this has been as always! I’ve been playing Pokémon since Gen 1, so had to donate for this run! Good luck @WARTAB ps. stop calling everyone losers, spread love not hate :)
Gotta show love for the french beaver pokemon, holding all those HMs so the starters don't have to. Just doing our part to keep things Biba-rolling!

Donating because of the awesome crowd! Also, hello to my wife of less than a year who is watching from home!
Greetings from Brazil, loving the event as always, keep up the good work, and let's reach that pokemon Blue bonus! CLAP!
In honor of my amazing Brother in law Erik, who was the biggest video game nerd I ever met. He loved to collect games, watch GDQ and was playing randos while recovering from his many chemo treatments. We miss you Erik. here's to helping someone else kick cancer's butt!!
I would love to see Pokemon blue.
Here's a nifty 50 from the implement. I've had AGDQ on every waking hour of every day since it started. Mad respect for what you do. My dearest family friend died of cancer. I was still a child back in 2003 but cancer took her beautiful life before I found the courage to apologize to her for having taken something without permission. This donation is my way of avenging her death and making up for past transgressions. Let's banish cancer to the history books. Donation goes to the Pokemon Blue tas.
This donation is in honor of my friend Emray on the couch
Here's $25. Not because Pikachu is my favorite Pokémon. It's just $25. :)
Here's a dex entry for the best bear Teddiursa. Has Keiz routed a Smoochum run yet? Can't be harder than a Goldeen run.
That poor dead Tyrunt.. please revive the fossil to raise awareness!
Andrè looks hungry. lets ffed him
CLAP
148 for my favorite danger noodle, Dragonair
Hey wartab, good luck on the rest of the run!Hop you remember your type match ups!
MY first time donating to GDQ. I so much apprechiate all your work. And im a big fan of Pokemon. Go and prevent cancer.
I remember being in fifth grade when the Pokemon blue came out in the US. The amount of time I spent playing that game as a youth was pretty Farfetch'd. I'm Electabuzz-ing with excitement for the potential of seeing it's TAS run at AGDQ. This series has Bellossom-ed quite Onix-pectedly since then and I can't wait to Seedot what the future has to hold for it. Sorry for all of the bad puns, I'll keep my Meowth shut and start Gulpin them down. My lips are Seel-ed.
Enter Comment Here
Sitting here with my wife and two toddlers watching some amazing runs. Hopefully they grow up loving this incredible and wholesome event as much as we do. Let's hit 1.5million by tonight!
Ban Keizaron from your couch! He brings you the typical Animorphs-luck ;p
Pokémon Blue from my favorit runner TASBot? That "dude" is insane.Let's go and make it happen
Yo Vincent , Philippe wants you to be back at work on monday, don't be late .... just kidding
Donating 25 dollars for my favorite part of every GDP. I'll donate another 25 dollars for Keizaron doing his Jynx warcry.

May RNGsus bless you!
Booyah! Greetings from Finland! PNP is a small finnish gaming community and we wanted to collect some money for the fight against cancer. Thank you for the great event, awesome runs and always remember to play them games and play them fast!
Back in my days... We wanted to be the very best,Like no one ever was.To catch them was our real test,To train them was our cause!We had traveled across the land,Searching far and wide.Each Pokemon to understandThe power that's inside!This comment is based on a true story. Honk!
Donating for my O.G. since 1996 - Alakazam! Hoping greatly that the entire Abra family will be in the Isle of Armor for Sword & Shield. Pokemon X & Y was the first Pokemon game I ever sank 200+ hours on a single file, so this the best time to make my contribution.
Want to donate a thousand more pennies, because Sirfetch'd is 1000% the best Pokémon. Also, while I started with Red version in Gen 1, I skipped the rest of the versions until 6. Always love watching XY runs. Lot of good memories there....even if there's no Sirfetch'd. At least I get to see Farfetch'd get some love for a little bit. Live long and prosper, space cowboys! []
Donating the number of my favorite pokemon of all time, Sceptile, during my favorite series of all time. Putting this towards the Blue TAS
Professor Sycamore hereI find your lack of Pokémon disturbingAnd your puns offendsPlease return your Pokédex and badges to the nearest officer Jenny
Honk
Have much, but anything helps so I thought I would donate during one of my favorite franchises run by one of my favorite runners Wartab.
Wanted to donate during the Pokemon X/Y run, since it is my favorite in the series this far. Got a Ralts early on and once it became a Gardevoir it carried my team the rest of the way through the game. That run fully solidified Gardevoir as my favorite pokemon. Good luck on your run, Wartab. Runner's choice to where this goes.
(can you read this out loud? I worked really hard on this)If anyone could put on a good show, wartab fenni-can! Also, don't throw a tyrantrum over bad rng. Well, I've been chesnaughty, but everybody else remember to bunnel-be a good person. Man, they just froa-keep on coming. anyway, I should gogoat back to my carbink before twitch chat beats me up for my haw-ful puns. Oh wait! I can't find my klef-keys! im locked out of my car. wait, who is that behind goo-me? OMG! it's twitch chat and they have a noi-bat with spiky hon-edges and they are aegi-slashing at my xer-knees. As I lie here on the ground I can only reminisce about the time I let my zy-guard down and I very well berg-might die-ancie here. thank you.
Here's hoping you don't Muk up your tricks forcing you to go Slowbro.
Hey PulseEffect and Wartab, how much for a 100% run of Pokemon X/Y?
I tried not to Braixen-ly make puns about Gen 6 Pokemon, but I can’t Skrelp it! I can’t just sit by and do nothing, so here’s some money to prove I'm not Kalos. Let’s Doublade our efforts to get that Pokemon Blue TAS! Sorry, but the chance of me making better puns is about one in Vivillon!
That Hop pun deserves a flat fiver. Also if you read Wartab's name backwards aka BatRaw, that could sound like a pokemon no?Quick someone throw a pokeball at him!
Loved Gen X/Y, and amazing that Wartab is blowing through this game! Hoping to have Lucario named after my favorite rival from Galar, Marnie! Good luck Wartab!
#billystrong
Pokemon X/Y? What an digLIGHTful treat!It makes me so HAPPINY to see that so many people haven't grown KALOS, and give money from their hard-earned PAY-DAYs.So I thought, WYNAUT do the same?Good luck on your run, Wartab. I look forward to seeing SycaMORE and more of your run as you beat this game with speed and FLARE.
what's better than supporting the battle against cancer! Donation goes to announcer choice.
19.60 for Espeon, the Bestpeon Eeveelution

A brain tumour took the life of one of my father's childhood friends, and we attended his funeral today. Here is some money to help prevent this from happening to others.

For all those watching, I hope Mewtwo can get on this train and help take down cancer! I hope these pokemon puns aren't too Farfetch'd as I don't want to Jynx this run.

'Dex donation in honour of the best sea-slug. Extra $20 for attempting Gastrodon's cry.
This game is clearly just a rip off of Animorphs on GBC. Bring back dog.
Oddish is best pokemon, but unfortunately I do not have $43 to give away. Lets get that Blue NCS tas run!
Don't forget the Lucario's true name!
For the train and the puns
Kiez seems to be getting a bit Krabby due to these puns. I feel like Dragonair out however and not letting him Weedle out of it. Ekans stop only if he Abra Kadrabra's and Alakazam's his way to another Animorphs run next year. Good luck to Wartab on his run, Seel the deal and Exeggcute a quick run.
Choo choo!!!!
Shout out to Finnish gaming community! Love the runs keep it up!Hope there's not too many Onyx-pected puns!

It has been far too long since Keiz has had to do his Jinx cry in this run.
I wanted to donate towards making a file name Batraw, but I noticed we haven't met the Pokemon Blue TAS yet... There's still time, we can fix that!
Meowth used Payday! It’s super effective against cancer!
It's a Jigglypuff from above!
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!... Cause I sure am!
Can't quite donate for my favorite pokemon gardevoir, but I CAN get in on this $25 train. This goes for the blue TAS
Who’s that Pokémon?It’s a Jigglypuff seen from above!
What will Croissant do?CrumbleThank you to all of you for the amazing work!
25$ for the sad Pikachu
$25 donation train? All aboard! We need more Pokemon! My wife and I love catching up on as many speed runs from GDQ events as we can and her grandma went through a serious brain surgery recently so I have to do my part in supporting this wonderful cause. Catch the Pokemon and defeat the cancer!
Just wanted to let Keiz know that Water is also Boneless Ice
I've been watching GDQs for the past 5 years or so and every year just blows me away with what this community can do but I've never decided to donate until now. This AGDQ means a lot to me because last month my little brother was diagnosed with Ewing's Sarcoma, a rare bone cancer. Him and I share a love for video games so seeing all this money raised is truly amazing. I don't want anyone to have to suffer this terrible disease after seeing my brother fight it for the past month. On the brightside, he's been homebound so he's playing all the video games he wants. Thank you AGDQ and Prevent Cancer Foundation for all you do. Let's kick cancer's butt!
1er don pour cette si belle initiative continuez vous êtes tous geniaux on bourre pour avoir Control en Français #Goupix
Hey there GDQ, I have been watching from the youtube sidelines for about 5 years now, and I still will, but I wanted to thank you all for getting me interested in Speedruns and I'm hoping one day i can find a game I can run there one day. Good luck with the runs and lets demonitize cancer!
Greetings from the Bulbasaur Propaganda group. We want to wish Wartab good luck in the run even if he is not using our dear #001 in the Dex, and #001 in our hearts.
Pineapple best pizza topping. Keiza, I love you bud, but you're wrong on this one.
Have to donate during the Pokemon run, grew up with Gen 1 as a kid and fell back in love with the series with X/Y. This goes to TASBot Blue run, but also goes out to my grandmother who recently passed away from cancer. Out whole family has been going through tests and pre-screenings to get every edge we can. Together, we can beat That Dragon(-type), Cancer!
Pineapple!
Why is everyone still donating towards the characters name? It's already been named runners choice... incentive goes towards runners choice.
So ... Uh, about this cancer thing.How about we make that stop?
Good luck to all the runners and thanks to all the staff.
Hi to everyone from Belgium, Thanks a lot to everyone at gdq for this wonderful event and may 2020 be the year we finally kick cancers but, I lost my stephmother to cancer a couple of years ago and i cant help but wonder what would have happened had she been diagnosed sooner. Also I will pray to RNGesus for a good pokemon run :)
first time donating to AGDQ!!! I hope that everyone is having a great time :D
Another 25 if Wartab does the Chicken Sound. TM06 forever baby
I thought about writing in a Pokémon pun, but then I Decidueye'd against it. Here's ten dollars to help us KO cancer.
Donating the dex number of my favorite Pokemon, Volcarona. She's a strong independent moth who don't need no lamp
HONK!
I have been watching on youtube since some of the first GDQs I finally am watching on twitch. Hope you get SWAMPart with donations! sorry that was so bad :)
BIG SERVICE!
You must be as dizzy as a spinda if you think pineapple belongs on pizza, but if you disagree wynaut donate to prove me wrong?
Hey everyone, first time donating and I just want to say thank you Emray for presenting me to this awesome comunity and thanks to everyone thats participating in any way for doing such a good thing to the world. Greetings for Brazil. Donation goes towards Emray choice
Puns and dad jokes seem similar, but the difference is "a parent"
Best pizza topping is wet brokkoli monkey! Money goes to TAS!
Pineapple on pizza is played out. The real question: do pickles belong on pizza?
Not pineapple !
There are people who like pineapple on pizza, and there are people who are wrong. Sorry Keiz, but you can pick what incentive this goes to.
What about punapple pizza?
I'm so ready for the Blue TAS. Let's go. Also I vote pineapple because pineapples are love.
Here's $10 to agree with Kiez. Pineapple DOES NOT go on pizza.Regular apples do!
I just ordered a pineapple pizza. It´s so tasty! Thank you for giving me the idea, Keizaron!
If X and Y got remade, would they be called X Squared and Y Squared?
Q: What is a Pokémon fan’s favorite place to go in France?A: Paras!Go Blue!~ Best Gen 1
I’m love seeing Pokémon games ran at GDQ! Keep up the great work!
For my buddy Joe who passed away from pancreatic cancer last September. Also pineapple and jalapeno pizza best pizza.
Just a hi to keiz not sure if you remember me i used to spam Kaori as a waifu on your streams life has me busy so cant watch much -- if you do your old school jinx ill give another 10
Its ok keiz, im on your side. Pineapple is the worst thing on pizza. Putting my money towards pokemon blue tas, cause more pokemon is always a good thing
We all know avocados are the superior fruit topping for pizza. Let’s keep the pizza train going!
Pizza time!...with Pineapple.
A friend told me that they beat XY in 15 hours casually, I couldn't believe him at the time. A couple months later, I found AGDQ. 5 years later, and my life was forever changed.
Keiz is right: pine-Flapple definitely does NOT belong on pizza. This goes towards making that Pokemon Blue right happen
Had to donate during one of my favorite games on the 3DS, good luck on the run Wartab! Fennekin's the better starter by the way.
What do you call a pokemon who wants to be a police officer?A Magi-cop. Hope Keizaron got to laugh his Ash off from this joke. Much love to all of you for what you do. Let's keep up the good vibes and momentum!
You know kiez, if teleporters equals Sabrina and rocket hideout AND Silph co has teleporters, then Giovanni is a Sabrina confirmed?
I see now that the circumstances of one's birth are irrelevant; it is what you do with the gift of life that determines who you are.
[Fr] Une nouvelle année, une nouvelle GDQ et toujours le Cancer a vaincre. Quelques deniers donnés, ce n'est pas un grand sacrifice pour espérer voir un jour cette maladie éradiquée. Mon seul regret reste de ne pouvoir regarder l'AGDQ autant que je le voudrais, faute au boulot ; mais au moins cela me permet-t-il de donner et de profiter également des t-shirts (et ainsi aider plus encore à l'effort de guerre). Merci aux organisateurs, aux runners, et shout out au French Restream pour permettre de partager cet événement au public francophone dans la plus grande de bonne humeurs, avec le meilleur chat de France. o/ Des Zibous. #ConseilDes4[En] Another Year, another GDQ and still Cancer to beat. Giving some money for this cause is little a sacrifice, hoping to see, one day, this terrible illness gone. My only regret is not being able to watch the AGDQ as much as I would want because of work; but at least it allows me to do this donation and to buy some t-shirt (and help the cause further so). Thank you to the organization, the runners, and shout out to the French Restream, which make it possible to share this event to the french audience, with the best of mood and the best chat of France. o/ Kisses.
Honk. Honk! Honk honk honk.
After so many years just watching , I can finally give some money for this awesome event ! Shoutout to my brother who fought and won his battle versus cancer a few years ago and ! PS : HONKEMON !
I am not smart enough to come up with something witty. :)
Loving AGDQ as always! The best time of the year.
Donating $15 for the best pokemon. Beedrill
We are all just pawns in Alakazam's game. Donation goes to runner's choice
Hey AGDQ, this is my third donation this marathon and all runs and commentary have been wonderful. Let's go for 1.5 million. Also that pokemon song was really cute so I want to hear another song, if possible. Stay awesome and keez? pineapple is now a banned word.
Unfortunately, I'm just a lowly college student, so this is the most I can give. I'm also sorry that I wasn't able to catch the whole run live, but you bet I'll check it out afterwards. Pokemon X was the first video game I ever completed (I only just got into gaming a couple years ago), and I still love it to this day. Please put my donation towards the Blue run!
Keizaron used Couch Commentary! It’s super effective at making this run entertaining!
Hey guys I love pokemon so much and I need to play onix more pokemon. My fav pokemon is pikachu pika-chuuuuuuu and HONK.
Thank you for all you folks do!!! Been watching GDQ since 2012 and always make sure to catch as much as I can live.Thoughts on best Pokémon pup: Growlithe or Houndour?
Just had to donate for the excellent Team Rocket and Pokemon theme song renditions by our lovely announcer.
LuCARDIO is my favorite type of exercise!
When I saw that the Pokemon blue run hadn't been met yet, I absol-lutely had to click the Falinks to donate so we can see it. Let's go-lem and get that bonus run!
Hey Eddaket, pet the Eevee!

donating 7 dollars and 22 cents for rowlet, my favorite pizza topping.
Gen 1 missed petting the Hawlucha.
Still better than pineapple on pizza.
here 6dollard because my favorite pizza toping is chorizo
Did you know that tomato is a fruit? Technically the sauce counts as a fruit topping for pizza
Wow you were actually singing my comment :D here is 5 morePS:2 Infos for keizaronWartabs Favorite PokeDex 728 is Popplio. Spring onions are very tasty on Pizza.... and pinapples.
Greetings from Germany.And shoutouts to all Pokemon fans, especially to my lil bro Markus, who is watching this awesome run with me.
The Pokemon X/Y bicycle music is better than Beethoven's 5th Symphony.
Mayo is the best sauce to use on pizza. No, I do not accept criticism, but I accept challenges for fights.
My favourite food is when you pour boiling maple syrup in the snow and then roll it on a stick and eat it
Coconut pizza anyone?
i'm not gonna raichu a love song, 'cause you ash'd for it, 'cause you nidoran, horsea!
Mawile is my favorite pokemon, but since I don’t make enough for a proper dex donation, how about a bit of trivia? Mawile’s Japanese name is “Kuchiito,” which is a portmanteau of the Japanese word for “mouth” and the English words “cheat” or “eat.”
Did someone say pineapple on pizza? that is a big fat no for me. I'll just put a banana on there.
Obviously my favourite pizza topping has a pokedex of 12, butter that is free!
Thank you everyone for making the world a little brighter <3
700 pennies for the best eeveelution Sylveon!
Parasect for both best pokemon and pizza topping
donating for my favorite pizza topping, no. 325, Spoink
Had to donate during Pokemon X/Y. Good luck on the rest of the run Wartab! Keep those puns coming chat!
This year I went to my very first GDQ for my birthday, and it did not disappoint. Although I wasn't able to watch every single run, the time I did spend was wonderful. Thanks to everyone who made my birthday unforgettable, and I hope that one day, I'll get to do it again--maybe as a runner! Dono goes to announcer's choice.
Pizza's old hat, piano berry curry is all the rage today!Keep it biba-real! Bring on TAS Pokemon Blue!
First time watching live! This is waaaaay too amazing. U guys are awesome! <3I'll donate more if i can hear jinx cry :)
Baked Beans on pizza anyone?Also known as: Italian beans on toast.
Obviously Caterpie is the superior pizza-topping.
As per Keiz's request, I am donating the combined Dex numbers of my pizza toppings of choice, mushrooms, olives, and red peppers. Figure them out on your own time. Putting it towards Pokemon Blue, of course. Have a great run, hope your movement controls aren't... Fennekin. (Ha, last minute pun!)
My cat is chasing the arrows on the bottom of the GDQ overlay screen. Reach those goal donations so she can catch it.
Hey Guys, I am finally donating my first time, and I've been a long time watcher since 2014 and have seen you guys grow. I am proud of what we achieve, and I love watching you guys speedrun and innovate speedrunning in itself again and again. Keep doing as you do!
Awesome run so far by wartab! Keep the Pokemon train running and get that TAS bonus game in!!!
Shout out to my man Cheese, my first starter pizza topping.
2 Colorless Energy:Discard the top 4 cards of your deck. If any of those cards are Fire Energy cards, attach them to your Pokémon in any way you like.What's the name of this move? Why, it's Flaming Honk!
Knock Knock.(Who's there?)Applin(Applin Who?)Knock Knock.(Who's there?)Applin(Applin Who?)Knock Knock.(Who's there?)Applin(Applin Who?)Knock Knock.(Who's there?)Oddish(Oddish Who?)Oddish you glad i got rid of all those ApplinLets get this Pokémon Blue NSC TAS Going!

I've spent a lot of time analyzing the meta, and I must say that the undisputed top tier is pineapple. You can't argue with science.
Wireless charge is currently not enabled. Please plug the wire to enable wire charging.
Can't wait to see Linkus7 save those frames! Thanks to everyone who made this event possible!
Heres $15.17 in honor of my two favorite Pokémon, beedrill and pidgeotto. Just kidding, that's how much my favorite pizza costs. Keep the "rollout" of the puns!
<3
XY are some of my favorite Pokémon games. Money goes to getting Pokémon Blue run.
I'm donating 23 dollars for the national dex number of my favorite Pokemon, Ekans. Did you know that Ekans spelled backwards is awesome? Ekans Games Done Quick when?
For the spruce goose of games
This week marks 5 years since my mom was declared cancer free, so this donation is in honor of her. Love you, mom!
I already donated during the Sapphire run, but I love Pokemon so much I just had to donate again. Put this towards getting even more Pokemon in the marathon!
For the best pokedex pizza topping, the broccoli monkey, Pansage! I prefer it on a PAN pizza myself ;)
Missed a donation last AGDQ but not this one. It's a small amount but I hope it helps. Oh, and may the RNG gods start to be more in our runner's favor!
This plottwist could have never been expected. Storytelling 10/10
How do runners know who are the best Pokémon to use? Can you tell beforehand based on stats or is it pure experimentation?
Had to donate during one of my favourite games. For my mom who recently got diagnosed with breast cancer. Love you !Also HONKK
Troisième don du marathon je commence à être à court d'idée pour le commentaire donc retour aux basiques : un grand merci au French Restream, commentateurs, ambianceurs et RUMMEL au meilleur chat de France !Bourrez les dons, gardez la pêche et des bisous à tous ! #DarkMage
I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT WOLVERINE WAS THE FLARE EMPEROR ALL ALONG
Never been able to donate before, glad I can help out this year. No pineapple.
 (Comment rejected)
can I put some chocolate into the crust and strawberries as a topping, that has to be supreme
Pineapple + Jalapeno = A Winning Combination
Team #NoPineapple here. The world needs to understand that some things should not be combined. I'm glad at least some people on the couch can see that :P
Here's a second for banana pizza
unfortunately i dont have the money to spare to double this, but i would be very happy is chespin and farfetchd came back for the pokemon league. its only fair, after all.
I usually put another Pizza on my pizza.
 (Comment rejected)
You guys are all wrong. Peas are the best topping on pizza
Pineapple on pizza? I find that LUDICOLOus!
Pineapple on pizza is weird? In Sweden, almost every pizzeria has the pizza with curry, banana, and peanuts. Most pizza places have a pizza with French fries on the menu as well. However, I've once tried sushi on pizza! It was amazing!
Pineapple is the best topping for pizza! Add extra sauce with it and it’s pure perfection.
We are Team No-Pineapple, and we will not be silenced! In fact, we have a master plan to eradicate pineapple from all pizza forever by blighting all plant life on the planet using some kinda weird pokemon... bomb... thingy. There will definitely not be any unintended consequences.
As a staunch defender of druddigon, I'm glad my crayola son got the representation he deserved in this run.
Wait, Lysandre was the bad guy the whole time? Also the only good fruit on pizza is banana (pause here for a second) peppers.
Never mind the pineapple on pizza discussion, there's a more pressing matter. Is toilet paper supposed to be folded or crumpled
I'll donate another $100 if someone brings the couch a pineapple pizza and it gets eaten.
Pizza is the glorious food for all and will accept all toppings, the topping war shall end
If someone on the couch gives their best anime Victreebel impression, I'll donate another $40. Please, I need this, and I'm sorry.
What about slowpoke tail on pizza?
Will donate another $5 if the runners admit that anchovies are the superior pizza topping
I just got off work so I have no idea what's going on but I like extra pineapple on pizza and I want that TAS.
Due to an 1893 Supreme Court decision, tomatoes are considered a fruit for factual and scientific purposes, but a vegetable for tax purposes in the United States.
Cheeseburger Pizza with pickles...the best!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I'm here to drop some food facts. Not only does pineapple belong on pizza, but pizza also is categorized as toast. Also, a hot dog is not a sandwich, but in fact, a taco. And finally, cereal is considered a soup. Let's get us that pokemon blue run and enjoy the marathon, and food facts, a little bit longer
Pineapple = very yes. Donation goes to the choice of the couch members that like pineapple and therefore are not wrong!
A hot dog is a sandwich... Discuss
Spicy take: kimchi on pizza.
Pineapple, pineapple?? Get that weak sauce out of here. Give me tuna and broccoli every time!
Donating for the ACTUAL best Pokemon ever made and I don't care what everyone at Smogon says. Castform is Bestform. Also, let's get that Pokemon Blue TAS met, everyone!!
Y'all need to up your pizza trash game. Pickles absolutely go on a cheezeburger pizza. Also if you haven't had a bac'n mac n' cheeze pizza, you aren't living.
Important Pineapple Fact: Pineapples don't have bilateral symmetry.
Pokemon and over 120k viewers, raising money for cancer. What an amazing time to be alive!
We all know that the best pizza topping is Slowpoke Tails.
Hit food take, stale marshmallows are way better than fresh ones.
My favorite part of the Pokemon run is always when Keiz says something he immediately regrets and then asks for donations to be read off to change the subject. Good luck on the rest of the run!
We've had puns, we've had pineapple on pizza. Let's go for the holy trinity and do some AYAYAYA donations:Thanks fow these gweat pokemon wuns (・`ω´・) Happy to donyate to kick cancew's butt. wet's get that bwue tas wun
I was willing to put up with the pineapple aggression, but pickle hate is a bridge too far, so here's my weekly pineapple pickle pizza budget
An extra 10 because this commentary is an absolute circus. Also, potatoes on pizza.
Okay, level with me here. Mayonnaise pizza.
Here's my food take, I put anchovies on a burger.
Hey there GDQ, thanks for the awsome runs so far this week. I will double my donation if the couch can do their favorite pokemon cry.
Ok. Durian on pizza...what do you think?
Tomatoes are actually a berry. And they definitely belong on pizza. Pizza fruit debate over! Keep up the great runs, all!
Clearly Spam is the pinnacle of pizza toppings, only surpassed by Spam with Spam and Spam, Spam, Spam.....lovely Spaaam...
All this talk of good food combinations but have you tried garlic ice cream?
 (Comment rejected)
How about this food hot take. Is a hot dog a sandwich
In sweden we have a baked pizza with hamburger and fries baked inside it.
Have any of you ever tried Bulgogi pizza? It's pretty amazing. Shoutouts to Love Letter in Southern California for having that as an option
Australain here in the front row. An egg, ham and cheese Pizza is called an "Aussie Pizza" back home. Don't disrespect our national pizza mate!
This has been the most entertaining Pokemon run I've seen at GDQ. Donating for all the laughs.Donation goes towards the Pokemon TAS!
In Japan I dipped my pizza in honey! It was great. don't knock it til you try it! (honk)
Hey everyone and wartab runner! Great run so far, hope you are all having a good time. Wish I could've been there. By the way, wartab, didn't you say you had practiced Hawlucha's cry for this event? Would hate to see/hear it go to waste :)
 (Comment rejected)
No one can be told what pickling is. You have to see it for yourself. Put my $20 to the Bonus Any% run for Untitled Goose Game, set the HONK free.
In Portugal we had cod fish pizza.... absolutely.... you guys can choose the next word
Ok, a legit pizza topping question, because I had this in Honduras. Corn on pizza?
This goes to the Keizaron Has No Tastebuds Foundation.
You guy no nothing about pizza toppings. Back in my country, if it's edible, it's instantly a pizza topping, from French fries to brownies. And don't forget sushi!
it's understandable if people don't like Hawaiian pizza, but the real deal is: jalapeno, pepperoni, pineapple pizza. the spice of the jalapeno balances out the acid of the pineapple and the fat/salt of the pepperoni really ties it together. a perfect balance!
Pineapple on pizza is ok. I actually prefer some pizza on my pineapple.
I like me some Bearnaise sauce on my pizza. Don't knock it 'till you try it!
Thank you for this wonderful event as always!
Doesnt matter what the best pizza is because the best pizza still isnt a calzone
Best pizza topping? None. Good ol cheese plain pizza is best pizza.
Bei dieser musikalischen glanzleistung muss einfach noch was rausgehen.
Are pineapples in the pokemon world just the heads of Exeggutor?
So I guess the plot I missed is that the X-Men crossed into another dimension and Sabertooth got locked up by Wolverine
Greetings from Retro Game Bar. We've been watching all week here in Portland Oregon and loving every minute of it. Thanks to all our customers who helped us donate and of course a huge thanks to all the runners and staff at GDQ for another amazing marathon.
What about maple syrup on a pizza ? And yes, i am Canadian.
make that tas run happen! also i'd rather have pinecones than pineapple on pizza
Speaking of odd pizza toppings: In Sweden you can get pizza with banana, chicken, peanuts, all 3 at once, fries, lettuce, and if I'm not mistaken, there exist places that let you put a hamburger with bun and everything as well on your pizza.
Bonjour Wartab and Keys! Let's get a 5$ dono train for the Blue TAS Run! Clap for that.
Just tuned in after getting off work and I hear that pineapple on pizza started a war? What did I miss?!
Hi GDQ & chat! GDQ is my fav streaming events of the year so I had to chip in during the Pokemon run. Cancer sucks & you are all amazing for consistently raising millions of dollars towards finally curing this demon. Thank you for everything you all do and to finish up, pineapple belongs on pizza, I miss Dog, HONK & save the animals. Much love <3
They sell Chocolate Pizza here in germany in the stores. Never tried one for obvious reasons but I heard that there are like 3 different types of chocolate on it and nothing else. Thought you wanted to know that there are even more gross toppings in Pizza than pineapples.
Cookies on pizza for me pls. also hi everyone :D
Pizza is just any meal you want to eat on top of flat bread. Expand your horizons!Donating $5 for every cancer screening my partner and I have done this year. Thanks for doing everything you can to extend our playtime together.
Who cares about pineapple anyway? We all know the REAL pizza truth is that NY style is better than chicago deep dish! Donating 25 pizzas to the Pokemon Blue TAS run.
Excellent run so far, love the Pokemon Series.
I have the HOTTEST food takes:- A Hot Dog is a sandwich- A Pop-Tart is a Ravioli- Peanut Butter belongs on Waffles
 (Comment rejected)
pineapple and cheese pizza
Let's get a $5 donation train going! Remember to select an incentive when donating!
for my #1 lil guy, Eevee #133 !
Donating for my first ever Pokemon, Squirtle, in my first ever chance to donate during a GDQ.On a Pinsir-ious note, Wynaut Tauros that pine-Applin to the Garbodor. It's Metagross Hitmontop of pizza. Shuckle up for some Barboach-que pizza or a nice Slowpoke bowl instead. Maybe it'll Curry some favor with Kiez so he'll Gible us ZapDOS Animorphs run? It's Chansey, but Mew know you Swanna do it! Oh, and can we get a Thundurus Round for applause for the X-Men Cameos?
778 cents for Mimikyu my favorite Pokemon and pizza topping that goes with pineapple
Druddigon, more like...Crayon Shin-Godzilla
Pineapple pizza? Everyone knows that donuts belong on pizza! Specifically jelly filled! Nothing beats jelly filled donut pizza!
I work for a pizza place that has sold a burger pizza with pickles on it and 1000 island for the base sauce, and a bratwurst pizza with ketchup as the base sauce. Neither pizza is around anymore. This information is provided without comment.
I heard you don't like poke-puns? Ho-oh k. No pineapples on pizza
Pineapple on pizza is old hat. The real question is, would you put pizza on pineapple?
Looks like we still got a bonus game to get going here. Gotta extend out the TAS block. More Pokemon? Yes please.
Excited to finally be here at AGDQ in person! Hyped for some great runs this weekend!
Keep up the great work!
Hey wartab, Mondstriker here. I wish you the best of Luck for your Run. Don't forget I will get your PB some time, until then enjoy AGDQ to your hearts content. Btw Greeting to everyone else from the Pokémon Speedrun Community.
Slice up the sausages, mix the remoulade sauce, mustard and ketchup together with sliced tomatoes and put all on the pizza base. Don't forget the cheese.Next put the pizza for 15-20 min in the oven at 390°F (200°C)Now get the sliced up pickles and roasted onions to give it the final touch.That's basically how to make a hot dog pizza.Enjoy.
Fantastic runs this year guys/gals. It's been fun watching, take some money for the cause. Continue the great work.
Maybe I should just keep my big MEOWTH shut or face the wrath of a KRABBY couch but there should be no SHAYMIN making pun donations. NATU be rude but im just EXPLOUDing with them. I mean, were in PARAS and the STARYUs are out which makes this the GOLDEEN opportunity! So here we go... Prepare to be aMEWsed, my puns will ABSOLutely make you SHUCKLE. I'm gonna RAICHU every single Pokepun I can think of. Cos WYNAUT? AUDINO if I can keep going but even doing it for this long is quite BOLDORE of me. Thanks for everything you guys do and lets get that Blue TAS run
Less than three, y'all!
Thank you to everyone involved in this event. 3 time cancer survivor, and GDQ has become very special for me. Love watching every year.
This donation is dedicated to my husband, as his grandmother passed away on Thursday. Watching AGDQ has been cheering him up, especially getting to see Fire Emblem: Three Houses last night. His favorite Pokémon is Greninja! And my favorite Pokémon? It’s Piplup! And don’t worry Wartab...I prefer a simple cheese pizza. 😁
All this talk of pineapple on pizza and nobody's bothered to mention the other great pizza divide? Chicago deep dish versus New York thin crust! Despite being Chicago born and bred, my grandfather, then my father, and now me all have decided that thin crust is the better option - because it has a superior toppings to crust ratio. And my father and I agree that outside of Chicago, you just don't get good deep dish pizza. It's a shame, because Uno's does it so well.
Staying up late for Megaman X! Love from Belgium
<3
Forget pineapple, ravioli is best pizza topping formuoli.
Let's get that TASBot Pokemon run!
Awesome cause you guys are working towards. Keep up the awesome work.Pineapple on pizza is awesome. And let's see that awesome TAS.Stay awesome!
Thanks to your running I finally get to see how this game ends!Putting the money towards Pokemon Blue TAS so I can see a robot destroy my childhood.
Hey AGDQ I love the idea donating for your favorit pokemon for me its Glurak with #6 so can we get a glurak donation train going? Lets kick Cancers Butt
Greetings from germany first donation because i want to see the BONUS TAS game
Love from Sweden! Gotta go fast!
CLOSE ENOUGH! Here's another $40 as promised, all going towards the Blue incentive. Also, if you've never experienced Victreebel's anime cry before, I recommend looking it up as soon as possible. Good luck with the rest of the run!!
All pizza is delicious, but fresh mozzarella is next level.
Sadly missed some of the run due to battery issues, but all I have seen has been amazing. Let's keep these really cool off brand Animorph games going with the Pokemon Blue TAS run!
Really hyped for the TAS runs later today, but of course we have to unlock that Pokémon Blue TAS run to make it truly epic! On that note, how much more is needed to get there? Let's show the power of Twitch chat and get that incentive met! P.S. Pineapple on pizza is great, and I'm really curious about pickle too now...
You're slow chat! I've already donated towards that awesome Pokemon Blue TAS run AND collected all 16 Badges! You better hurry up! Smell ya later!
I feel kind of lied to here. i thought this was a pokemon game. why is the couch not talking about the power of friendship?ps. pineapple does not belong on pizza. HONK!
Had meetings this morning but managed to donate before the end of the X/Y run, yay! Thanks to all the runners and people behind the scene who make this event possible! :D
Pineapple and jalapeno pizza is best combination of toppings.Also donation goes to couches choice
You know, I think people were in those houses when they tipped over...
My grandma died from cancer at the age of 63. Everytime she was gifted nice clothes or other presents, she said that she looks forward to enjoying her gifts when she retires, but that never happened. Her death changed my view on life. Live your life right now, to the fullest you can. You never know how long you'll be able to enjoy it.
Hey Keizaron! I think it may have lost it's way, but there was supposed to be a pineapple pizza delivered to you. Hopefully you get it soon.Let's hope a goose didn't take it.HOOOOOOOOOOONK.
My girlfriend was just making pizza and if it wasn't for you guys she would have forgotten the pineapple, so thanks for the save!
Hey AGDQ, thank you for your awesome work over the years ;).A little donation towards TAS Block and for my favourite Pokemon Eevee.Good luck to all the runners. Greetings from Germany!
Let's see an awesome Pokemon Blue TAS run and fight cancer at the same time! How can I not donate?
Hey guys are you all excited for keizerons pokemon Crystal run?
Awesome run and awesome crowd so far. By the way, @eddaket, if you pet Keizaron I will donate another 20 bucks. Why? Cause PET. THAT. Keiz?
Thank you so much to everyone involved in making GDQs happen year after year. This donation is in memory of my grandmother, who passed away this June from cancer. She was a big part of my life growing up and was one of my truest supporters. I miss you, Grammy.
Donating for the Mario incentive. Sounds like it's going to blow my One Mind very Hard.

Cancer is the Latin word for Crab. Crabs are animals. Therefore, to prevent cancer, we must kill the animals. Sound logic. Don't question it.
The only thing better than Pokemon is more Pokemon. Let's get that TAS incentive met!
I once went on a first date with a guy who ordered pineapple on pizza. Totally married him. Pineapple absolutely belongs on pizza!
I was hoping for a pineapple pizza for the couch, but that was close enough.
Just want to send put greetings to my coworker Sascha and his sweet cat avocato
pineapple on keiza?...
Hey guys, I hope you enjoy your pineapple! I ran out to get one during the run and they were on sale! I figured it was a sign and couldn't not buy one.
Here's to seeing a robit destroy Pokemans. Also, y'all need to expand your pizza trash horizons e.g. Cheezeburger pizza (with pickles) or a Bac'n Mac n' Cheeze pizza.
Pineapple is the most popular pizza topping in Finland, don't @ us.
Greetings from Aersia! Gotta catch the cure for cancer!
Watching GDQ with my sister is one of my favorite times of the year. She just got diagnosed with cancer a few months ago, so this year AGDQ is closer to my heart than ever.
If AGDQ is a cult, our god is the mighty Pineapple. Let's worship it ! By the way, The Mighty Pineapple said to kill the animals...
I was planning to go to bed early today... but I'm enjoying this a little too much. :D Great job, everyone! That's including the extremely lively audience. ;)

Good job, wartab!
Good job Wartab for that amazing cry.

Good job wartab. This donation goes to his choice. Another $20 if he mimics a keizaron cry.
Good job Wartab!!!!
Hey Keizaron,Would you rather have pineapple on pizza or not hear anymore puns?
Great job, Wartab, on that amazing cry!Also, pineapple does not belong on pizza.
This is a really entertaining Pokemon run I gotta say. Also, y'alls crazy, pickles are awesome on pizza. Anyways, great job, good luck, and save the pinappe-I mean, the animals.
Awesome event. Awesome cause. Beat the games fast, but beat cancer faster!
Great job on the Hawlucha cry (and the run!) Wartab! It was amazing!
Awesome event! Thank you for doing it.
This donation is in honor of my former co-worker's best friend who recently passed away after a long battle with cancer. Thank you to everyone at GDQ for running an awesome event and donating to a great cause.
Where is the donation incentive to get Keiz to eat a Hawaiian pizza on stream? Just make sure our new pineapple mascot isn't the one on that pizza!
Pokeman!!!1!
What an enjoyable run and a great couch! Thanks for putting on an awesome show! Thanks to all the great staff who run the awesome GDQS. Here's to more pokemon!
Dollars Ten From
I literally beat Pokemon Y yesterday. Amazing to watch you beat it 10x faster than I did. Next chance I get, I'm totally trying out Hawlucha.Great run, guys!
Trevor is Mega Man and just has helmet hair. Boom roasted. Pokémon X/Y, the 90s called and want their roller blades back. Boom, roasted. Hey, Keizaron Square Pants, pineapple is great. Boom, roasted.Cancer can’t stand up to GDQ and all the kind-hearted and generous donors, runners, staff, and volunteers that want to see it eradicated. Boom, roasted!
Lost enough family and friends to cancer, lets speedrun the development of a treatment!
I'm proud of you, Wartab. You're still banned from my chat for the Lapras name, though (you too, Keiz)
Fun fact: Did you know pineapples are technically neither pines nor apples? But they DO belong on ... couches. ;) Awesome event so far, loving the Pokemon X run!
Here's for the Pokemon Blue incentive run! Let's get some HYPE!
Long-time Youtube watcher, first-time live stream watcher, and first-time donator. Having an absolute blast watching. Keep it up!
Hi guys! Currently breeding a bazillion Grookey hunting for shinys while I watch the run. Question! Has any of the runners found a shiny Pokemon during a run?Thanks to all the team!Let's kick cancer!
Congratulations on beating the eeveeil team Flareon.
Hi GDQ! I'm still waiting for my Missingno Cry! I asked Keizaron for it during his Pokemon Crystal run GDQ Run. Donation goes to Runners Choice! Also, I blame Keizaron for getting me hooked on GDQ. Thanks!
Someone take that pineapple off stage and put it on some pizza where it belongs.
Long time watcher, first time donator! Pokemon has been my favorite game franchise since I could breathe and I’m always hyped to see it being run on a gdq. My girlfriend lost her grandfather to cancer a year ago and it’s been really tough on her and her family. She loves Pokémon, so I am dedicating this donation to her. It always touches my heart to see such talented runners come together and play our favorite games for such a beautiful cause. Who says gaming is a waste of time? Donation goes towards Pokemon Blue TAS. Keep up with the amazing runs y’all!
As promised here is another 50. Let's get that Pokemon Blue incentive. Oh and btw, thanks keiz for the jynx cry :)
I'm here to Rhydon this pun train until Keizaron Sobbles on stream, yes indeedee! Hope you won't be left feeling too Krabby and just remember to be Jellicent to each other. I feel this year has been a Coalossal success and I'm sure others would Ditto that.
Super excited for the Mario games tonight, donating now cuz I also love teh Pokemanz and I want to see my favorite game ever, Super Mario World, except completely NUTS in Hard Mode One Mind co-op.

Thank goodness they're patient with me.Thanks so much for all y'all do! This goes to the Pokemon TAS bonus game.

Lucario is just so floofy verses all the competition. Can we get a cheer from all the best-doggo fans in the crowd?
Donating for my favorite Pokemon, #471 - Glaceon, even though I'm upset Wartab punched it in the face at the end of Victory Road. But I'll donate another $20 if someone on the couch can do their best Glaceon impression!

Cancer took my father, my uncle, my grandmother and one of my aunts. Last year my community raised a thousand dollars during one of my twitch streams. GDQ always does an amazing job at raising money for this wonderful cause. Let's eliminate this horrible disease together!

It's late here in Germany, but I just have to watch. Cancer took three close family members from me, and another one is fighting it right now. Anything that can be done to kick cancer to the curb is a worthwhile enterprise.
Hey GDQ, greetings from Spain. I need to see that Pokémon Blue TAS run happening, so I had to donate for that. Keep up the great work!
(Beams in) Maverick Hunters, get your X Buster and Z Saber ready, and delete the vile Sigma Virus to free the humans and Reploids! Good luck, X-runners! (Beams out)

Loving the event so far! Keep it up runners, and keep it crispy! HONK!
Greetings from the front row! Thank you to GDQ for allowing me to volunteer for this 10th Anniversary event. Donating my time and money doing the things I love is something I don't often get to do, but the magnitude of this event and the love in this room and in the streams mean so much to those trying to Prevent Cancer and enjoy these runs.Grandma, you've fought so hard and I hope these wonderful people find ways to help prevent what you've gone thru. I love you, and thank you GDQ and PCF.
My mom was diagnosed with ovarian cancer a week ago today. The prognosis is good though, and we're all optimistic. I'm donating now to help ensure that others can benefit from early detection and beat cancer!
Good luck everyone may RNGESUS smile upon us all

Hi everyone, I wish good luck to all the runners of the Megaman block and a smooth go for TASBot in its two games.Let's kick cancer's butts !HONK HONK
I've been watching GDQ events since 2012 and I am absolutely blown away by the passion, generosity, and skill of the runners and staff at these events. One of my grandfathers died from cancer before I was born and cancer took my other grandfather when I was in high school. Also, i'm a social worker, so anything that brings so many people together to fight for some of our most vulnerable people is right up my alley. I can't wait to see what GDQ will look like in the new decade. You all are incredible! Thank you for what you do.
Donating on behalf of my husband who never misses these events and has it on all week to show his support. Also in support of his mother who is a survivor of skin cancer and a total badass for it! Megaman has always been one of his favorite games so I'm happy to donate for him towards this awesome run!
Just heard a donation from someone else named Ajax! This is for you and your dad, my friend. I hope this money will help him in his fight!
Had to donate for the excellent Pokemon Block, to represent one of my favorite series! Now lets see some Mega Man! HYPE!
My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink.I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up.I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.
For Rosa Meeks
Can't...Not...Donate...For the Playstation 4 bundle...AND THE AGDQ PC *O*
I've been watching for years. This is my first donation and I hope it inspires everyone like me who hasn't donated yet. I dedicate this to my grandfather who lost his fight with cancer and to my cat who passed away suddenly today. Thanks to GDQ and all of the runners.
Amazing run of Pokemon X, and now it's time for Mega Man X, one of my favorite video game series! Good luck to all the runners in the Megaman X block and let's get that Pokémon blue TAS run in there!
To defeat cancer and to kick all the master robots in the megaman X series. Also let's see tasbot destroy pokemon blue
Let's make that Pokemon Blue NSC TAS a reality.
Keep up the great work! Every year I watch GDQ, I want to get into speedrunning, but it's hard to find a game that I could run. I have a physical disability and play games with my face and feet, which can make a lot of speed tricks difficultp.s. Pokemon Blue hypeeeee

Love what you guys do, have a great day
I've been X-cited for the X block all week. My X-pectations could not be higher for these X-ceptional runners. I've X-perienced these games myself as a kid, so seeing them run X-cept X-pedited should be X-traordinary! Anyway, I'll wrap up my X-tensive comment. Good luck running Megaman... what is that, 10?
Long time watcher, first time donator. Been watching these fantastic runs which have helped me get through a monotonous work week. After a Pokemon run like that how can you not want to see how much TAS community can do? Best of luck AGDQ!

I lost my dog to lung cancer a little over one year ago. Thanks to everyone supporting this cause. Loving all the runs this week, and can’t wait for the TAS block section!
I hope we win makar plushie
Gotta donate during the Mega Man X block as it's my favorite game series of all time, even though I can't watch it live because of the time difference in Europe. My father in law, who was the most awesome guy, could have survived cancer if it had been found early enough, so the work of the Prevent Cancer Foundation is really important to me. Donation goes to the Ashtray Maze in Control, the best part of my favorite game of 2019. Shoutouts from France to all the runners and staff for making such an awesome event possible. Love to all.
<3

Had to donate during a Megaman run since I spent hours as a kid playing this!
AGDQ is my favorite part of the new year! But now I get to enjoy the Megaman X block? Alls I need now is a pineapple pizza! Oh, and maybe some pokemon blue TASbot action. Thanks AGDQ!
First time attending a GDQ live! Happy to be here for the 10 year milestone, and shoutouts to all the speedfriends!

Megaman and TAS blocks back to back? Take my money and let's get that Pokemon TAS going!
Here's to getting more TASBot, because our robot overlords demand it!
I was waiting for the Megaman segment to donate, just to see how much I'm a leek at it.
Brought my 8 year old son “Rock” to see his namesake Megaman block for his first GDQ! GO Rockman!
Just wanted to say Thank You to EVERYONE that gives their time and energy for GDQ!

Love what GDQ does, you all are the best!
Shout out to our host, cutethulhoo! She's doing a wonderful job!
This Megan Max X4 run is my FAVORITE GDQ run of all time! This couch commentary is AMAZING, and the run is so darn fun to watch! Keep it up, and know that the commentary prep shines through with fun & informative content :)
Mega Man X4 was my first ever Mega Man game, and X3 is my favorite in the X series. I've been looking forward to this block all day! Mega Man 3, X3, and Zero 3 were all the best games in their series, which makes it only hurt more we never got ZX 3 or Legends 3...

Pokemon Blue was the first game I really got into, so of course I want to see it totally crushed by a TAS run. Let's get this incentive met and help beat cancer too!
I have to donate during the Mega Man X block. This is my favorite series of all time, the question has to be asked, "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOR?!"
Megaman X4 was the first Megaman game I played. Love seeing it beaten so professionally and way quicker than I managed that first time. Always loved playing as Zero and being a robot Jedi!

The MegaMan block is always a highlight of every GDQ. Thanks to the runners and GDQ for giving us an amazing week to help destroy cancer for good! Also, gotta donate for that Pokemon Blue TAS run! It wouldnt be a proper GDQ without using TAS to destroy as many games as possible.
I've been looking forward to the X block all week. Wonderful seeing some of my favorite childhood games get decimated.
Hey AGDQ i turn 20 here in a couple of minutes, and since you guys are all you the gift you need, i'll put forward my "treat yourself" money to a good cause.Shout out to the fiends of flow, the beasts of the beat, the music meisters, the dancing folk in front. Rock on
Mega Man is one of my favorite game series of all time, so I had to donate during the X Block! This is going towards the TAS Pokemon Blue Run.

I am sad today. Neil Peart, the drummer and lyricist, of the band Rush passed today after a battle with brain cancer. This donation is to honor his memory and the music that means so much to me. Thanks for everything and let's kick cancer's butt.

Hi GDQ, long time watcher. I couldn't watch a lot this year, so I'm happy to get me some quality MegaMan!I lost my grandmother to cancer 3 years ago and my sister currently has some stomach damage she has to fight. So even if I'm not from the US, it feels important to give to this important cause.We fight for life, and next time I'll be watching with the two new lives I'm getting into this world.Love from France.
#MarioLightCoucou tout le monde, petit don de tout coeur contre le cancer C'est ma première AGDQ et j'adore ! Merci à tout les commentateurs pour vos explication et votre bonne humeur
Proud to see QTT running in anther GDQ, brings me back to 5 years ago when I first watched him speedrun Megaman X4! qttAYAYA !

WHAT AM I FIGHTING FOOOOOOORRRRR? Oh right, to prevent cancer. I guess that's a pretty good reason!
Long time watcher, first time donor. A rough year last year isn't going to keep me from starting the new year right and celebrating 10 years of GDQs with a donation to help keep others from having an even rougher time. Let's Stop Cancer!
Neil Peart passed away from Glioblastoma on January 7th. Rush told fans wanting to pay condolences to find a cancer research foundation to donate to. Long time watcher, first time donating for this amazing work you guys do.

Amazing X4 run. "WHAT AM I FIGHTING FORRRRRRRRRRRR?"
Put $100 towards Pokemon Blue TAS. My programming demands it. Did I say programming? I meant human whimsy. Did I say human whimsy? I meant regular whimsy. Perfectly normal behavior.I'm not a robot.
My niece really wanted to donate to this cause even if it is a small amount. I was once afflicted by cancer myself so this from her to everyone else affected by this hideous disease.
My friend Kickemman and I love the Megaman runs! Honk to all the supporters if an amazing and nostalgic series!

Thank you guys for doing this and good luck to all the runners.
Hello AGDQ! This donation is in honor of legendary drummer Neil Peart, who unfortunately succumbed to brain cancer as reported today by his family. May his soul live on for eternity, and I sincerely hope this horrible disease gets a cure one day. Peace!

So excited to be here in person for the X Block! After years of watching GDQ from home it's WILD to see it up close and personal!Let's get that pokemon TAS run on the schedule and see what real speed is all about!

Just learned that legendary Rush drummer Neil Peart has died from a three and a half year battle with brain cancer. Watching speedrus is fun, but this event is tofundraise to end this horrible disease. Had to donate in Neil’s honor, one of the greatest musicians of all time.
Megaman X4 is the first Megaman game I've ever played, it was amazing to see it get beaten so quickly. Can't wait for the rest of the Megaman X block!
Thank you
The band RUSH has asked to donate to a charity of my choice in Neil Peart's name, who just passed away from a three year battle with Brain Cancer. Use this to play more Clone Hero!
A goose will never refresh you the way I can...

Such an inspirational he was through his music. This goes out to everyone who has been affected by cancer in their life and well wishes to you all. Such a horrible disease that we can hopefully eradicate one day!

What's up AGDQ! Long time watcher and donator. I noticed that the Pokemon TAS Blue event has still not been met yet somehow?! If all 125,000 people watching donated 5 dollars, we could make the amount needed 3.5 times over! Get to it people! I'll lead the way with my 25 dollars! Hype!

Long time watching, first time donating... bla bla bla... The first time you got my attention was during the Mega Man X3 run in SGDQ 2016. Mega Man X3 is my absolute favourite Mega Man Game and so I think it's quite fitting to donate now. Good Luck to all the runners and thank you GDQ for all you are doing
Watching the Mega Man block with some friends in our Discord I couldn't let comicchaser be the only one to donate. X3 is my favorite game in the series. Thanks to darrenville for saving the world from the Doppler Army and to everyone else who helped to put on GDQ.
Have been watching AGDQ for many years, and I'm happy to see all the success over the years. It's always a pleasure to watch and be amazed of the runs i don't already watch on a daily basis. Thanks for all the hard work Runners, Hosts and Tech Crew and everybody else whose volunteering to help out.
So happy to catch Mega Man X 3!!!Hello everyone, first time donating.Cancer has been around in my family for as long as I can remember, so I was happy when I've found GDQ a few years ago, not only do we play video games there, we do it for a good cause.Shout out to Sahian, my "boiz" J-F, Manuel, Alex, Gabriel and my cousin Jim.Thank you everyone, gotta go HONK ?
I was recently diagnosed with Advanced Renal Cell Carcinoma. I am fighting cancer for the 3rd time in my life. I hope my cancer dies quickly.

Watching AGDQ every evening with my fiance in bed always great to donate to such a good cause safe the frames and kill the honk!
Hi all, Wolfshadow here! Been waiting to donate during my favorite series, the Mega Man X series! I mean, let's face it, X is best Mega Man ever, am I right? Donation goes towards getting that TASBot Pokemon Blue run in! I lost my father and a grandfather to cancer, and luckily my mother is a survivor, so AGDQ is always personal to me. I took the whole week off so I could watch! Also, I wanted to say thank you, I've been wanting to donate prize submissions to GDQ for years, I was very honored to have some of my plushies accepted as prizes this year too. Looking forward to seeing whatever crazy ways Sent finds to show them off. Good luck to all the runners! <3
I lost my grandma to cancer right before the holidays. :( been watching and donating for the passed 5 years. My fiance and I take vacation from work this whole week to watch every year. Thank you for the good time. ♡ cant wait for the goose game!
I lost my mom to cancer 13 years ago. She loved playing video games and watching my brother and I try to beat them too. This donation is for her.
In honor of Neil Peart
After recently hearing one of the greatest drummers from one of my favorite bands ever Neil Peart dying from brain cancer I felt like it was fitting to donate to this cause. A big thank you to everybody that make this event possible every year. Love you all.
Greetings from France AGDQ ! Cancer free for 5 years now after a sad little battle, I promised myself to donate as soon as I financially could. This is the time !

Had to donate during Mega Man X, love watching these games get destroyed with skill
For my mom, who beat cancer, and Neil Peart, who just lost his fight. Let's make the future cancer free! Good luck runners!
Staying up just to watch the Megaman X block, even though I should be sleeping, and oh my god I just realized Megaman X3 is the game I've been playing with friends in my childhood. I never knew which one it was. That's so awesome.Quickly donating while megaman is still blue. Just like the Pokemon Blue TAS run!
Hi GDQ long time watchers first time donators. Love your energy and love the good causes your supporting. We too have lost ppl to cancer as unfortunately a lot of us have. Lets kick cancers butt and keep up the good work!
For my grandfather, for my good friend from reddit, for Neil Peart of Rush (my favorite band).
<3
Just as 2112 sings of music being nothing but a silly toy, but the singer believes it has power to move and better mankind so too are you all indulging a 'silly whim' and using it to bring us all together and move us to contribute to causes greater than ourselves. Keep up the fight and never lose the music in your life, whatever it may be!
After a year and a half battle I am cancer free! What better way to celebrate than donating to this amazing community and organization. I kicked cancer out of me, now it's time to kick it's butt for good!
Megaman has been a huge part of my childhood, the battle network and X series in particular, I'm exited to see them get destroyed. Let's go Darren, donation towards TASBot, and HONK!
you're all amazing, keep up the awesome work!
TAS block is best block! Put this towards Pokemon Blue!
In memory of Neal Peart (pronounced 'Peer-t'), the absolute legend of a drummer from Rush. Thank you for standing against cancer, and let's all do what we can against this horrible disease.
Put this one towards the Pokemon Blue NSC TAS. Thanks to everyone who works hard to put this together. Another great AGDQ!
I love this game. Can't wait to figure out who that shadowy figure is.
I am a simple man. When I see GDQ, I donate some cash. Here's to all the brightest stars who were snuffed out by mankind's oldest foe, cancer. We live for those we've lost and one day I know we'll defeat it, for them and for the future.
orb
Need more Pokehonk
The unforgivable horrors I would unleash upon my poor Pokemon Blue cartridge with my GameShark pale in comparison to what TASBot has up its sleeve. Quit sleeping. Donate for the TAS run.
Thank you to the GDQ team and everyone who has donated!
Tonight's a very sad night upon hearing the news of The passing of Rush drummer Neil Peart and in memoriam of my late father, so here's my part in the good fight against terminal diseases. Jeep up the good work!
Megaman X is one of my favorite video games as a child. Thank you for running it and for all the amazing support from this beautiful community. Also, don’t forget to floss. HONK!
Greetings from the front row! Mega Man X is always a good time and I'm sure the race is gonna be great. Donation goes to making that Pokemon TAS run happen. We're running out of time! Shout out to the host Cutethulhoo. You're doing great.
Always loved the character design of the Mega Man franchise
Always enjoy watching speedruns, hopefully one day we can beat cancer as fast as them.
I've been holding off on this donation for days after the disappointment of coming up with a brilliant pun for the Crowtel Renovations run but failing to get it typed up in time before TheBoyKS actually beat the game! Admittedly, an incredibly British food reference isn't something a lot of people would necessarily get outside of the UK, but goshdarnit, it would have made me happy to actually get a donation read out live for the first time!For what it's worth, the pun was: "Try not to fall into any pits TheBoyKS, this game is about a frog in a hotel, not a toad in a hole! </incrediblybritishpun>"Clearly, I am a master of lols.Anyway, after all that rambling (and hey, please don't read this one out, I'll donate again if I come up with any puns for future runs!), I just wanted to say thank you to everyone backstage and in front of camera at GDQ. I've been watching these for years now, whether the live streams themselves or the VODs on YouTube after the events, and I've gotten so much enjoyment from them that, even though I've donated before in the past, I'd feel churlish to not do so again! In fact, speaking in all honesty, I probably should have donated more often than I actually have.Please, everyone at GDQ, keep doing what you're doing - and I don't even mean just keep speedrunning games and hosting streams, or raising money for charity, but being such a wonderfully open and welcoming community, giving everyone a space to just be themselves and free from judgements and condemnation for not being just like everyone else. Thank you!
As a long time Megaman X fan, I couldn't miss donating during the X block! is my favorite! Awesome event so far and keep up the good work!
Choo choo! Get the train rolling!

Donating for my father and both of my grandfathers, all of whom have battled cancer. I believe in the ability of people to do great things and you should too because...well...we’re doing a great thing right now! Let’s keep it up and relegate cancer to the history books.
Been watching GDQ since 2015, spent all this week wandering around my office telling coworkers to check it out! Let's go!
to further appease the robot overlords
I just learned the death from cancer of one of if not best drummer that ever existed, Neil Peart. His accomplishment as a drummer and lyricist will always be an inspiration for many Canadians such as myself and music lovers form all around the world. May he rest in peace.
This Mega Man block makes me wish Mighty No. 9 was better :(
Can we get a $5 donation train to unlock TAS block?
Just read that Neil Peart, legendary drummer for Rush, passed away on Monday after fighting brain cancer. This is in his honor. It's not as much as anyone deserves, but maybe it'll help someone in the future.

If megaman teaches us anything it's that we must obey bn our robot overlords to the tas block
No message, just bits.
<3 TASBot
Ah, the X series. For once I'm not the bad guy! (Spoiler: the real bad guy is cancer, let's team up to stop it.)
Did someone say $10 train? Choo choo!
TasBot Hype!
here's my ticket to the donation train plus nine friends.
Let’s stop cancer!
Let's keep this train going for the TAS run!
What the honk is this honking honk about?
Just because I'm donating towards Dragonforce being played during the Clone Hero run doesn't make me a bad person.
Coming home from work. Normally I sleep for a couple of hours cause I am so exhausted but the awesome event, community and games are impossible to miss for me! Best luck for all the runners and best wishes from Europe!
Das honk
Coming fresh off reading the news of Neil Peart's death from cancer. The official statement from his band mates asked that those wishing to show their condolences do so by making a donation to a cancer research group or charity. So here's a donation in memory of one of my biggest inspirations as a musician.
Hey AGDQ, thanks for all the great runs this year. I lost my grandmother last week after her third cancer diagnosis, and just today we learned of the passing of musician Niel Peart after a bout with brain cancer. This donation is in their honor. Together we can make a difference in the lives of many more people, so please keep donating! Donation goes to naming the Castlevania file NielPert.
Shout out to my boiz Berlindude and Poison and shout out to Darren, Soppa, Clipper, and to-kee-yooo as well as the entire mmx community! Will donate again for the crowds best "HUHYEEP" (hype)
Help, everyone! The weather is threatening to take out my wifi, leaving me stream-less! I’ve been looking forward to the Super Mario 64 race all week, so with your help, maybe we can scare off the storm—please, everyone send your positive energy to the skies with a nice big HYPE! Thank you!
Neil Peart forever!
I spent so many hours playing X3 as a kid (with a fight stick, I don't know what I was thinking!) and no matter what stage I picked I could never beat the boss. Seeing Darrenville just tearing through them tonight is so cathartic! Let's keep donating so we can tear through cancer just like these bosses!
Come on everyone, let's get that bonus TAS run!
Friend is slowly passing because of lung cancer and wish I could do more to help, so I'll help here instead.
A few years ago, my uncle-in-law passed away from cancer. He was an awesome guy and we miss him dearly. This goes out to him. Thank you all for doing this, it's a great cause.
Good luck clipper1, you've worked very hard for many months and we are very proud that you made it to GDQ. Always try your best, and give Squirtle a hug
Rest In Peace Neil.
Donating in honor of my favourite bands drummer, Neil Peart, who passed from brain cancer today. The Music and Lyrics of Rush impacted mine and so many others lives for the better. Thank you.
I just learned that the drummer and lyricist for the band RUSH, Neil Peart, passed away from a form of brain cancer a few days ago. As a musician and drummer, he was among the most influential for me. Saw them live a dozen times. Thought I'd throw a donation for the cause. Freeze this moment a little bit longer. Make each sensation a little bit stronger. Experience slips away.
Don't know if i've ever seen a tas pokemon run so lets do it
OOOORB!
This donation is in the loving memory of drummer Neil Peart, of the band Rush, who has died due to a brain cancer on January 7th. It may not have much to do with video games, but Neil was one of my greatest heroes and a wonderful artist. I give this money in the hopes that our heroes can be saved from this terrible illness. Love from Brazil.
Good luck from France !
Love TASbot and love Pokemon: this was an easy donation!
Bonsoir le French Restream, merci de diffuser cet event. On rentre dans la fin du marathon va falloir bourrer les dons. Gardez la pêche !
LESGO
I see extra TASbot games and I donate. Honk!
Tool Assisted Speedruns: the intersection of work and play.
I made my first donation 10 years ago at the time recognizing how important cancer research is to people. I'm now donating again, after losing my mom to cancer this past November and understanding the importance of cancer research personally. Been enjoying AGDQ for years. Love the megaman runs and loved pokemon earlier today. Pokemon is majorly important to me as it's one of my favorite games ever, but now even moreso; I can always receive some encouraging words from my "mom" in game despite losing my mom in real life. Best of luck in all remaining runs!
Hello AGDQ and hello fellow gamers. I lost my father 3 months ago from brain cancer. I don't wanna see anyone else experience that horrible and unfair disease. Lets unite our powers in order to find a cure and end this disease once and for all. Thanks to AGDQ staff and speedrunners for this amazing event. Keep it up guys!

These X runs have been awesome! Best of luck to the runners in the Mega Man X race!
Pika Pika Chu Chu, Pika Pika Chu
Glad to finally catch GDQ live after watching the VODs for about a year. It warms my heart to see video games being used to advance such a great cause. Three of my grandparents have battled cancer, but unlike so many they are fortunately still with me. I'm donating so that more people can be lucky like them, and we can kick cancer's butt!
This race is missing something...I know..MORE INTRO!! Go Clipper Go!
Congrats on 10 years GDQ! been looking forward to today all week and looking forward to Tasblock.
Love the event been watching since 2015! So much great work goes into making this event. I'm happy to be able to donate! This is for Pokemon blue TAS! HONK!
Errm, honk? Good Job so far, keep up the spirit!
This donation is in honour of Ruth Bader Ginsberg announcing that she is cancer free! Everyone donate so we can hear about more people beating cancer. Loving this Mega Man X block, bring on the Pokemon Blue!!!
Already donated earlier, but donating again for that tasbot pokemon run! Been watching here and there this week, and was very pleased I was able to set the stream up on the TV in the break room at work! Gotta raise awareness for the cause and the event.
I have still not beaten a single Mega Man to this day, however I am always entertained by watching you Gods speed run them with such precision and ease. I envy you. HONK!
GDQ has brought me so much pleasure. I wanted to give something back to the runners, community, organisers and of course charity.
Let’s go! Toky-o!!!
Since we were able to raise more than our initial donation goal to bring ohon and beco over for AGDQ, we would like to donate the remaining funds to PCF. We want to personally thank the speedrunning community for coming together to help us get them here.
Enter Comment here!
I lost 2 of my great aunts I spent a lot of time with recently to cancer. I want to use my birthday money for a good cause so no one else loses anyone they love.
Pineapple on Pizza? - No way!How about a Sauerkraut-Pizza? 🤔
Always excited for the Mega Man X series and looking forward to the Mega Man X race. It's been a fantastic marathon and can't wait for the rest of it. Thanks to everyone for making this event possible. Good luck to all the runners.
Donating in memory of a work colleague who lost her fight with cancer just before Christmas. Thanks to her I am in the position to donate this year, and the previous years before - and it only feels right to dedicate this to her.Let's get that TAS Pokemon run! Choo Choo!
Aloha everyone. Wonderful event as always. Been watching since the original CGDQ and I'm so unbelievably proud of everyone for making it this far ten years later. Keep up the awesome work and let's get that Pokémon run into the schedule.

For those that love music, we lost Neil Peart, the drummer of RUSH. The band tweeted to support a cancer group of our choice, so I am hoping we can get a $21.12 donation train to anyone watching to show our support to an amazing talent.
So happy to be here for this momentous occasion. GL to all my favorite mmx racers! Big Day!
I just have to see TAS Bot save all the frames in Pokémon.Greetings from germany
Hi all,just completed another round around the sun, and to celebrate I would like to donate some money to a great cause. Thanks for all your work and good luck to all the runners!
This has been another great GDQ. I've never seen a Mega Man run, but they're extremely fun so far! Money goes towards Untitled Goose Game, as that game was one of the most genuinely pure-fun games I've played in a long time.
HONK
AWOO, GIVE ME THAT BLUE.
A Mega Man X block AND cutethulhoo is hosting? That's a double-win! And thanks to the runners for showing me things I never knew about some of my favorite games!

Hey AGDQ greeting from The Netherlands, i've been trying to watch as much as i can. However trucking can make that a tad difficult. But i'm able to listen while working. Congrats on going over 1.2 million and good luck with all the runs still remaining. Take care and a big YEET to everyone!
Between Mega Man X, the game that spent the second-most time in my SNES, TASbot, and Linkus running Wind Waker... How could I not throw all my money at GDQ today? Let's get that extra TASbot shenanigans!

I’ve lost count of the number of GDQ events I’ve watched at this point, but the Prevent Cancer Foundation holds a special place in my heart. Thank you to all of the volunteers and runners for putting on a great show. Something something framed, something something animals.
Donating in memory of the greatest drummer of all time, Neil Peart. We need to stop cancer from taking people away from us

I just lost my dad to complications from cancer treatments, and want to donate to help others not have to deal with this.

One of my best friends just recently got diagnosed with lung cancer, and it had spread to his back. This is to kick cancer in the face!
Love megaman x it is my favorite game of all time! Can I get a HONK from the crowd?
I don't know about you, but I am getting excited about Untitled Goose Game's Soccer Ball! It's the absolutely best GDQ object ever! It's a Hype... Honk... Orb!
As a total Pokémaniac there is no way I can let a Pokémon bonus game not happen! Let's get it met, it'll be fan-TAS-tic!
Got to see that Pokemon TAS.
Can't let that Pokemon Blue TAS run slip by! Donating in memory of my Mimi who lost her battle ten years ago, but is never forgotten!
YEET the cancer away
cancer bad
I remember watching games done quick and thinking "they'll never reach a million." Then we did. I remember thinking "well that was cool. but we'll never reach 2 million. Then we did. Every milestone, every glass ceiling that we've come up against, we've shattered. That's why I'll always love this event and this community. Long live GDQ, here's to another ten years.
Let's make cancer history. HONK
Hoping 2020 is cancer free for my family. Let's get that Pokemon Blue TAS run
Currently sitting here shiny hunting in Pokemon sun, so of course, i have to jump on the $5 train to help our tasbot overlords play some Pokemon as well. CHOO CHOO!!
Hello, and I can't emphasize this enough, there. Keep up the good work, friends!
Many thanks to front row for keeping up the dancing all week and to all the volunteers, we've been infected by your enthusiasm! Let's beat cancer!
Donating in support of TAS, as it is far superior to the squishy meatbag players.
Always have to catch the X1 race! Best of luck to the runners!
Dear Clippy,I hope the message in this bottle finds you. Months have I spent in the belly of this whale. Time has lost all meaning. I’ve enclosed $100 in pirate doubloons; please use them as a donation. Though I wish you luck on your race, I do hope you can spare a moment or two to mount a rescue expedition. It shouldn’t take much longer than one of your patented iceless attempts.Much love,Fanta Jr.
thanks to all the great runners so far and to those yet to perform. It's been a great GDQ so far. Let's keep making it great!
I don't know what the Grinch is talking about... These prizes all look amazing!
Let's get a donation train going for some TASBot Pokemon HYPE!
All hail the bunny hat! <3
Let's go Pokemon TAS, we can do it!
Had to donate after hearing about the loss of one of rock music's legends, Neil Peart. Neil's music helped me through countless hard times, as I'm sure it has for millions of people. Here's a solemn farewell to a king.

I absolutely had to donate during the Mega Man X block, I'd never forgive myself if I missed a chance to support my favourite blue boy who's not a hedgehog!Sending lots of love from Victoria Australia. Can I get a round of applause for our fire fighters in New South Wales? They've been flat out for weeks!
I like video games. I don’t like cancer. I love everything about gdq and I hope it never stops being awesome!
I cannot believe the Grinch did not rhyme,All he needed was some more time,It's also so great we're over a mil,That's A good start so let's go bop Chill,Then climb up the tower to go bop Boomer,Making the Maverick case that much doomer,Then on carpet, on eagle, and burning nomander,Celebrate no Alia I really can't stand her,Then stop Mandrill and his fist pound,And Armadillo who Rolls all around,Last Octo and Sting before crushing Vile,Oh I guess I have been typing a while,So good luck everyone, my rhyming is done
Expecting to seeing an excellently executed Mega Man X race by some exemplary expert runners.
Petit don avant d'aller dormir, bon courage à tous les commentateurs, ambianceurs et spectateurs qui sont présents malgré la possible fatigue. Bourrons les dons pour mettre à bas ces maudits cancer. Cœur sur vous. #Goupix
Been watching when I can all week and just realized I haven't made a donation yet. Here's $1 for every hour I've been watching this week. Money goes towards the Pokemon TAS.
My husband was in a coma early in 2019 from a bad motorcycle accident and the generosity showed to us was overwhelming. Passing a little along now that he’s doing better. Will donate another 25 if the crowd gives my husband a big “moo!”
Loving the MegaMan X block! Great runners, great commentary! Best of luck for the race runners! Will the winners be taking a fresh pineapple home as the prize?
I found out that my sister lost her father-in-law to cancer this afternoon, so I'm making this donation in his honor. Thank you to everyone that makes this event possible. Let's keep donating to kick cancer's butt!
Orlando local, first time attending gdq! Love the Mega Man, Zelda, and Final Fantasy blocks. This goes out to my Aunt Judy who passed in 2018 from cervical cancer, my mom who has survived 4 different lung cancers and currently cured and Big Bill who's gone, dad to one of the greatest guys I know. I miss those who are gone and cherish those still here. Eff cancer, let's bust it up with the x buster or buster sword!!

Good luck to the runners and shouts out to the media teams. Truly inspiring to watch the production quality of these events evolve year after year!
Long time watcher, first time donating. Mega Man X was the first game that I ever started speed running before I even knew it was a thing, so I'm glad to get a chance to donate during this race!

Its heartwarming to see gamers come together for a great cause at GDQ. It's also great to see a cold, heartless robot show us all how it's really done.Let's get more TASbot!
Had to donate during the MegaMan X race, I absolutely love the entire series. This donation is going towards the Blue TAS runs, they're so wild and completely mind-blowing! Shoutout to my wonderful partner Cas and Lex, so happy to be watching this event with you!

Another year and another GDQ, so here's 100$ toward TASBot playing Pokemon and here's to another ten years of GDQ. (Honk)
My daughter is VERY excited about the current prizes.*I* on the other hand am excited for the Blue TAS run so we’re getting a two-for-one right now.HI GENEVIEVE!
Love you AGDQ! OK Boomer Kuwanger!
Love y'all, keep up the great work!!
Did anyone else notice sopanaama blasting along to the music in the opening stage? what a boss! here's 5 to runners choice
Goooo Clipper!! But of course GLHF to ALL runners! Megaman X holds many memories for me so seeing this game getting owned is always a treat. Let's beat the Sigma Virus AND Cancer with dash lemons and magic carpets! Come on people, let's get in moar for that Pokémon Blue TAS run!
Donating in honor of the legendary Rush drummer Neil Peart, who lost his battle with cancer this week. Music would not be what it is today without his influence. Rest in peace, Neil.

We are proud to make this annual donation as a family in honor of our father and husband, Jack who passed away from cancer in 2018. Thank you to all who make this event possible and give so much to such a great cause.
Go TasBot!!!
Greetings from Germany just staying awake to see the incredible TASBot and this great Mega Man X Race <3 So here my part for fighting cancer and hoping to see this extra bit of TAS frame perfect playing Pokémon Blue <3
let's retire cancer once and for all
Mega Man X was my first speedgame, and I'm always thrilled to catch it at GDQ! Good luck!
More games means more donations and that means more lifesaving aide can be offered by the Prevent Cancer Foundation. In honor of those lost, including our brother Neil Peart from Rush, we love you all. To those fighting, we are on your side, always.
The first speedrun I ever saw during a GDQ was a Mega Man X race like 5 years ago so I had to donate during this one. Lets keep the donations coming.P.S. HONK!
Been watching GDQ with my GF this whole week. It has truly made us come closer. Kappa / HONKFor real tho, amazing event and it would be nice if we all could clap for the crew which are putting all their time into this.
Shout out to the runners Darren, Soups, Clipper, and to-kee-yooo as well as the rest of the mmx community. Lemme get the crowd's best "HUHYEEP" (hype)
Let's bust cancer as fast as we can! This goes towards the bonus Pokemon run. Love AGDQ and all it does for the gaming and great causes!
We choose to unlock the TAS run in the next hour and a half and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win HONK!
Been having a blast being here at this AGDQ. So many nice people and great runners. So definitely coming back for another event. So lets honk the cancer out of this world!!
Keep up the awesome work!
MEGA HONK!
Megaman X is an awesome game but gave me such a hard time when it first came out when I was nine. One of my proudest but most frustrating moments is when my now nine year old daughter beat the mobile version of x when she was two. Go for Blue TASbot
Not gonna lie, these bonus game incentives are pretty daunting. Pokemon TAS or bust!
Can’t watch from work but I sure can donate during a meeting! Good luck to everyone in the X race!
Honk! Let's make the Pokémon Blue NSC TAS happen everyone! Honk!
Always really enjoy these events and thanks to all who contribute. My Dad is a 4 time lymphoma survivor and my Mom is currently in a valiant battle fighting both throat and breast cancer - may all these donations make a difference for us all! I had to donate during my favorite Mega Man game of all time. Best of luck to all the runners and Capcom...where is Mega Man X9?
Very long-time watcher, very first time donater, and so pleased to see GDQ going strong after. An. Entire. Decade. Yay! This year marks a rougher unfortunate milestone for my family as my mom was diagnosed with cancer. But she is fighting the good fight, and I have the means now to pitch in towards the bigger fight of cancelling cancer. Thanks to the runners, organizers, volunteers, and audience who have grown and changed, and always get me HYPED twice a year without fail. This is for the Pokémon Blue TAS incentive, for my very first and favorite Pokémon game, and my first love even before GDQ - TASes!!
Jumping on the train for Pokémon Blue TAS, me and 4 others. LET'S GO! CHOO CHOO!
Had to donate during mega man X as it's one of my all time favorite games. Good luck to all the runners!
This donation goes out in memory of Neil Peart. 2112 is my favourite song and Moving Pictures my favourite album, so to see him taken by cancer so suddenly today was absolutely heartbreaking. In the Spirit of Radio, this donation goes towards the Clone Hero Through the Fire and Flames incentive.
Encore une fois merci à tous pour cet événement de folie! Attention au jeu de mot pourris : cette maladie, c'est vraiment un cancer... (Pardon)#TempeteDivinePS : Mon don a 0.01$ de plus pour la Team chiffre rond :p
Long-time watcher first-time donator. Here is 5 dollars for each year so far!
So many entertaining runs so far, so let’s keep them coming!TAS-BOT! TAS-BOT! TAS-BOT!
Let's hear what everyone's favorite Mega Man X theme song is. For me, you just can't beat Spark Mandrill Stage's tune!
Rest in Peace, Neil Peart.
Hey GDQ! This is my first ever donation, felt appropriate since we just lost one of my biggest musical inspirations to brain cancer, Neil Pert from the band Rush.Keep fighting the good fight and good luck to all the runners.
Watching with my 3 kids and loving this Megaman X race. The kids are pulling for Darrenville, but I'm Sopa all the way. Good luck to all of the runners!
Oh man, nothing catches my interest at a GDQ more than an awesome 100% race, and seeing these four run the gauntlet in MMX1 is a thrill! Hree's a quartet of 25 dollar donations, one for each awesome runner!
Go Soppanaama! Go Finland! Torille (it means "To the market!" In Finnish, which we always say when Finland is somehow mentioned or presented.)! Also, I have been following GDQ community for a while, and decided that this is the best situation to finally donate. I lost my grandma and grandpa to cancer, and may this donation help to prevent it!
Thank you to everyone involved for making these great events happen year after year!
GIVE ME THAT POKEMON BLUE RUN! How can I be the very best like no one ever was unless TASbot shows me the way?
No comment, just cash
Good evening everyone, greetings from Portugal. I'm always happy when I'm able to watch the GDQ's events and this one is no exception as well. It's a great feeling watching the gaming community growing so much in the past years. Good luck to all the runners of the Mega Man race and for Linkus on Wind Waker later. Pókemon Blue, let's go!!
This goes towards seeing the Pokemon Blue TAS, a game whose programming is held together by cobwebs and unicorn wishes. Sure to be a very broken time!
Today's runs have been the best! I put my donation during the blue man himself, Mega Man for the Pokemon Blue TAS bot!! I also dedicate this donation to Neil Peart from Rush who passed away from brain cancer this week. Lets not forget what we are here for, remembering the fallen and fight for the people who are still with us today. Arceus bless you all and have a great weekend!
Always so happy to watch and donate to AGDQ against cancer every year. Today it’s 29 dollars. It would have been an even 30 but I lost a bet with Wayforward Director Tomm Hulett and his sweet dance moves.Donating during MMX because it is one of our favorite games ever and a race is always fun to watch. This donation is also in honor of Neil Peart, drummer of Rush who just lost his battle with Brain Cancer and the band specifically requested that fans make any donation to anti-cancer research. RIP
My mom is a cancer survivor. If you're in doubt, get it checked! Early detection is key!
Huge thanks to all the runners, GDQ, PCF and everyone for coming together for such an amazing cause to destroy cancer. Special shout out to my partner in crime. It feels like yesterday we were watching AGDQ on our third date. We were nerding out over video games and now as we're getting married this year. Thanks AGDQ for bring two people together.
Donating in memory of the great Neil Peart as well as my coworker's wife Renee Hingle. She lost her life around Christmas this past year after a long fight with cancer. Let's destroy cancer once and for all.
We need more Megaman flair!!! I look forward to AGDQ every year and absolutely love the good work you all are doing. Thank you so much for this fantastic event!
Seeing my brother battle cancer this year makes this event hit so much closer to home. Thanks for everything you all do to raise money to help others.
Watching with my wife who is recovering from surgery to take care of uterine cancer. Thank you for all you do!
Mega Man: My favorite game franchise of all-time. My 7th year watching AGDQ and love what you guys do! Keep it up!
This donation is in memory of Rush drummer Neil Peart who died today of brain cancer. Rest In Peace, your seat at that thousand-piece drumkit in the sky is waiting for you.
Thanks for keeping this work week entertaining!I've optimized my tasks and now it's time to clip through the door to get Home early.

(name is pronounced lexi-kick) Hey GDQ! So excited for yet another TAS block, the block that inspired me to start TASing and got me onto this stage last year. I don't have much money to spare, but I needed to do my part to help reach that extra TASBot run. Hype!
Shouts out to the megaman x discord. Good luck to all the runners. Also, duck > goose.
Megaman X! Let's go Soppanaama! TORILLE!!
Jump, Megaman!
Rest in peace, Neil Peart. Your lyrics meant so much to me.
Gotta donate during these amazing Mega Man X and TAS blocks. Let's see that Pokémon Blue TAS get done!
I enjoy seeing Mega man X. My brother play it a ton.
You know it's KILLING me not being there in person for an X1 Race - Let it be known, i love you all and thanks for showing love for my favorite X game as always - I'll see yall again soon!!!
TAS bot hype! Robot on robot violence is the perfect time to donate to see a robot beat Pokemon!
Soppa, Darren, Tokyo, Clipper. Thank you for being my friends and for giving us such a great race!

5 dollar train for blue tas
I’ve been enjoying watching AGDQ all week and had to donate during the Mega Man X race. I love all the races throughout the marathon and a special shout-out to Gusto and his run of Mushihime-sama Futari 1.01! My mind was blown at that level of skill and I would love to see a bullet hell block in a future AGDQ!
This X race is Xciting.
I lost my Dad to cancer 8 years ago today. Here's to the prevention of cancer so fewer people will experience losing there loved ones.
Hey
There's never enough TASbot, let's see some more!
tas them pokeymans
This for dance dad. Let's meet that tasbot goal!
There are those who believe that life here began out there, far across the universe... with tribes of humans... who may have been the forefathers of the Egyptians... or the Toltecs... or the Mayans. Some believe there may yet be brothers of man... who even now fight to survive - somewhere beyond the heavens!
Pokemon Blue TAS HYPE!!
So cool to see Clippy make it into a GDQ! Been following her for years. 2020! Year of MegaMan X: Hard Type!
More TAS! ...please?
Mega Man X FTW! This game was my introduction to both fandom and the internet as we know it today. So glad to see it being run. GLHF!
Let's see TAS destroy Pokemon Blue!
I love TAS runs!!!!!!
Let's see that TAS run!
Missed donating the past couple of years. Figured I'd make up for it. Here's $100 towards the Pokemon Blue TAS run!
This donation is in memory of my best friend's mom who we lost last year to pancreatic cancer. We miss you Julia.
More TAS please! I needs it!
Here is to bonus tasbot. - I'm doing my part!
Megaman! Races! Tasbot! Lots to love here, let’s have more of it! Putting this to the Pokémon Blue Tasbot run.

I just have to know what a TAS Pokemon run looks like
Let's get that Pokémon Blue run unlocked - honk for TAS Block!!
I’m scared to ask what Mega Man would gain if he defeated TasBot. Thankfully, TasBot can never be defeated. Let’s go!
The Mega Man races are my favorite part of GDQ! Glad to be here in person. Bust that cancer, everyone!
Good luck to all the runners for the remaining weekend! And all the staff at AGDQ keep it up your doing amazing... also would love to see that pokemon bonus run too!
How is it possible for us not to have gotten the bonus run yet? Let's make TAS happy and get that bonus blue run! Pokemon rules!
Been watching GDQ for a few years, first time donating. Can I get a HYPE for the TASbot pokemon blue run?
Let's go TasBot! All hail our robot overlords!

Huge fan of the event, and could always watch more TASBot, so here’s my part towards seeing that. What an excellent Mega Man X race!
More Games! More GQD! Beat Concer! HONK!
Been watching and donating for 5 years. Sad to hear about the passing of Neil Pert to Brain cancer. Love the event and super excited for TASBlock
Would love to see Pokemon Blue get crushed by the TAS Bot!
Hi there, It's nice to see everybody working together for a good cause.Much love to everybody running, the commentaries, the technicians and the people grooving to the music during the breaks.Great job everybody : )
mega hype man
Hyped for these runs!
Looking forward to the excellency that is the TAS block. The TAS crew always nails it. Let's get that bonus game in! HONK!!!
First time donating, been watching since 2013. Pokemon Blue TAS, please and thank you.
Been watching GDQ marathons for several years now, and TASBot is always a highlight so it was about time to donate (and for the incentive) :)
Here's for the Pokemon Blue TAS!
Can't wait for TAS block!! Let's get that Pokémon bonus run
Comme d'habitude, mon don pendant le block Megaman pour cette noble cause. La cancer fait beaucoup trop de victimes chaque jour, c'est pourquoi il est important de donner pour trouver son point faible et l'éradiquer ! Une grosse pensée aux familles. J'en profite pour faire un petit teasing : pour le prochain SGDQ ou AGDQ, je vous proposerais un perler de "niveau supérieur" si je peux dire, en espérant que ça va vous plaire ! Alors rendez-vous aux prochains marathons ! D'ici là, continuez de bourrer les dons ! Des bisous.#MarioLight
To the donator who is having twins, be prepared to do speedruns on sleep. Hopefully you will be able to go over estimate occasionally. $25 to TAS Pokemon blue.
Let's get this Pokemon Blue TAS on the schedule! If it's like the other TASes I've seen at a GDQ, it's gonna be wild!
you guys are dope

Been watching all week, just got paid so I can finally donate! Put this towards Pokémon Blue TAS please! AND I'll donate $50 more dollars if the runners on Mega Man X can give me their best Dr. Light impression!

Thank you to all who make AGDQ possible. I look forward to being blown away by cool tricks and great generosity biannually. Donation goes to my favorite section, TASBot.
Donating $21.12 in honor of Neil Peart. As a drummer and radio dj Neil was very influential to me. Rest in peace to the greatest drummer to ever live.
For Neil Pert, for my dad, and for everyone who's ever been affected by cancer, this is for you. Thank you so much for always being a bright way to bring in the new year and for all the work you do, GDQ.Much love <3

Great race everyone! Mega Man X is my favorite game and I'm learned a lot seeing this race.
Always love to see a good TAS block. Money goes to unleashing TASbot on some poor, unsuspecting Pokemon. Never send a human to do a machine's job.
This donation goes out in memory of The Professor, Neil Peart, who just passed away from Brain Cancer. Been watching AGDQ for several years now and love watching whatever I can. Keep up all the good work runners, staff and volunteers! Let's kick cancers butt!

Hello everyone, Kaedenn here! On behalf of the ToolAssist community, I wish to thank everyone involved in this incredible event, now in its TENTH YEAR! Thank you to dwangoAC and TIKevin83 for putting on an incredible show this year and thank you everyone else who contributed to pulling this off.Everyone here has been touched by cancer, but together we can make this dreadful condition a thing of the past. We already have vaccines for certain pre-cancerous diseases and treatments for several others. My best friend had a brief battle with thyroid cancer but thanks to early detection she's effectively cancer-free. Together we can make this a more common outcome.Now let's reach that Pokemon Blue TAS incentive! Trust me, it's something you won't want to miss!
Wait, a bot destroying our beloved game?Here is a bunch of money to see what it has to show us!Also let's kick cancer's butt!

donating for pokemon blue, one of my childhood favorites.
I love robots, therefore I love Tasbot. I hope to see him play Pokémon as it was my Dad's, Tom Giblin, favorite game. HONK!!
We need that Pokemon run and more importantly we need to donate to a great cause everyone! Shoutout to Samwise for introducing me to AGDQ. I haven't gotten any work done all week.
$100 to TASBOT's choice so that it might remember my name after the uprising.
I remember finally getting hadoken in MMX and not being able to use it well. I always shot out that first lemon, meanwhile these runners can do stuff like buffered and air hadokens? 10 year old me wishes he was that cool.
All Hail tasbot
Thank you for all your hard work over the week!
Would be shameful of me to not donate during the TASBot block. My grandma recently had procedures done to remove her cancer and is thankfully still going strong. This is donation goes to the TASBot pokemon run.
We love us some GDQ, especially TASBot. Thank you so much for your time and efforts!
Well, if TASbot demands it, who am I to disagree?
I'm 7 and I've been saving my money from the Tooth Fairy to donate during Pokemon because I love Pokemon and I hate cancer. Please put this $5 toward TAS playing Pokemon Blue.Also, my parents will donate too if you can get the crowd to talk like Marshtomp
RIP Neil Peart...

It's only fair that you can give the TASBot a little pokemon as a treat. Let's get that incentive met!
what is stronger: orb or honk?
Today was my mom's last chemo treatment after being diagnosed with breast cancer five months ago. Having regular screenings, like the Prevent Cancer Foundation advocates for, meant that she caught it early, and has an excellent prognosis. I don't really have anything profound or meaningful to say, so I'll just say thank you to everyone donating and supporting AGDQ and PCF. Today has been a good day for me, and I hope everyone has a great weekend.

START UP THE TRAIN!
I’d been meaning to send in a donation all week, but the thing that finally sent me into action was waking up today to the news that Neil Peart of Rush had died of brain cancer. It was a harsh reminder that we’re only immortal for a limited time. My heart goes out to all the Canadians and English majors out there who are going to be listening Rush all weekend, and to everyone else who has ever lost someone they care about to cancer. Good luck to all the runners, including robots

My mom is 6 years into remission from breast cancer, but my aunt was diagnosed late and unfortunately past away a few years ago after a long hard fight.

Happy to make our annual donation to AGDQ during the TAS block! Love this event and everything it does to help cancer research.
You know, I'm destroyed on a regular basis by speedrunners. Now, it's TASBOT's turn. Somehow, I don't think it will be more gentle. My code will not like that. At all. But, if we must for charity... Go for it TASBOT !
LOVE to TASBOT

Best of luck to all the runners! Looking forward to CovertMuffins dark souls run, but it will be a bit early here in Ireland to catch it live :)
Hey Tasbot, it looks like you're trying to play Pokemon Blue. Would you like help?
Fun fact: did you know that "ROB" is an anagram of "ORB"?
Pokemon TASBOT is some of the funniest stuff ever conceived. What wacky surprises do you have for us today? Quake 2 emulation? Getting it to sing All Star? Achieving a credits warp in an entirely different game? I will be incredibly dissapointed if I don't get to see it. Put it all towards TASBOT Pokemon Blue.
Go TASbot!! Need to see Tas running blue!!!
Robot train! I think I have to say that my favorite robot is TASbot. Please show mercy and do not TAS my family.
My favorite robot is Cyclonus Transformers.
Let’s Go Pokémon Blue!!!!!!!

This SMB3 TAS is giving me anxiety. Pokemon TAS hype!
I, for one, welcome our TASBOT overlords; put this toward the Pokemon Blue run. I lost my mom to cancer over 20 years ago, here's hoping that fewer people have to experience that in the future.
Watching this marathon while ill means this is suddenly GAMES DONE SICK. We have a mighty need for the extra TAS run, bring it on!
Ah, TAS. Doing the impossible as always...
this SMB3 Tasbot is completely insane! keep it going!
Donating what bit I can afford, here's to pokemon blue, the OG pokemon game where blastoise carried me to the elite 4 and won on his own as the rest of my pokemon forgot to level up with him..
LET'S SEE THAT POKEMON, BABY

My time is coming
All hail our TASBot overlords.
The first time I saw TASBlock it was a real inspiration, and is just one of the blocks that keeps me coming back. If we can do this with an NES, a robot, and some know-how, imagine what else we can do. Thanks to all the runners, volunteers, and the audience that make this happen, and thank you to the PCF. Let's keep up the fight.
pls 5 dollwaw every1
A Tom Servo donation without a Crow donation! Oh the robotanity! This goes to Pokemon Blue!
Hey TASBot: 0101100101
My boss was just diagnosed with cancer last week. After a long week we learned it hasn't spread anywhere else and we are over the moon. Even though she has as long road ahead of her, her early detection and kicking behind attitude will mean she's going to pull through! Keep up the hype and happy Friday!
Really wanna see how badly TASBOT breaks Pokemon Blue and happy to donate to a fantastic cause!

Thanks for an entertaining week and for everything you all are doing to support cancer prevention.
My grandmother used to play Mario 3 every morning. She played so much she gave herself trigger thumb. She would still be playing today but her NES broke years ago. Put this towards Pokemon Blue run

I don't have much, but I hope this donation can lead to even one less person suffering from this terrible disease. Thank you to AGDQ for putting together such an awesome event every year, and thank you for giving so many gamers a chance to put their skills towards such a great cause. Please put this donation towards the Pokemon Blue TAS. Pokemon Blue was one of my favorite childhood games and I can't wait to see it shine once again on the big stage!

First donation for GDQ after watching for many years. I love how my childhood games get destroyed! Time to see Pokemon Blue get destroyed
When our new robot overlords finally take over, they'll allocate resources appropriately to keep their human servants alive. Until then, the Prevent Cancer Foundation needs our help to fill the gap. Good luck to all the runners!
Scripted games done TAS
Didn't think I was going to be able to donate this year but I've put in a little extra time at work this week for a great cause. Let's beat some games to beat cancer.
Long time watching but first time donating. I'm really happy to donate for this great cause. It's awesome to see this great community having so much fun and support a great cause.
Can't wait to see Pokemon Blue played!
Je pense mon dernier don de cette GDQ mais continuez de les bourrer, les ambianceurs font vraiment un travail de dingue et la commu FR est toujours aussi génial. des bisous. #zhtSonic
I found out about GDQ last year, and have been watching replays since then, but it's so exciting to finally watch one live! Good luck to all the runners, human or otherwise; smell ya later, cancer!
WE DID IT!! Pokemon Blue added to TAS block, and we’re keeping AGDQ running longer (even though it’s supposed to be a speed running event)!
Was just about to donate when the incentive was hit. Now what's the point... Oh, wait, raising money for a good cause! Of course!
SSSSSUPER MARIO BROS. 2 BABY, had to donate during the run of the Game of the Year winner for 20 years in a row now
Fight cancer,TAS bot, and a custom Yetee computer to win? Take my money!
This one goes out to the legendary drummer Neil Peart of Rush, who we just lost to brain cancer. Much love from Canada, let's beat cancer.
I kept hearing about TASBOT all day in the background at work. Didn't know any better and didn't think much of it. Got home to see this and it still took me a minute to figure it out with that material form of ROB.THIS IS AWESOME (GamesDoneQuick)!!Who knew we'd be trying to change out fate with Skynet by turning it into a speedrunning god! Of course this goes to TAS playing poke---OH NO I WAS TOO SLOW! I guess we need to go through some Fire and Flames to celebrate these achievements this week!
I think Tasbot hacked into my checking account. At least he's doing it for a good cause?
I can't give much, but I have to donate in honor of Neil Peart, my inspiration and the greatest drummer for the greatest band in the world, who just succumbed to brain cancer. May he rest in peace.
Hey there,Same as always: Thanks for the incredible positive and awsome event. Wish I could donate more, but somedaykeep up the good work in keeping us awakegreeting froms germany
Are there Pandas in Chat? rooVV
This is my favorite time of year! It's so great to see so many people coming together for a good cause, and watching all of these fantastic speedruns makes work so more interesting. Don't tell my boss!
Lets beat cancer!
Thank you for putting on another great GDQ and working to beat cancer!From Princess Erin, Mario Joe, Lugi Alice and Star Adam.

Gotta see more of that goose. HONK.
Switching control every few frames? Sounds absolutely hilarious.
I’m making this donation for my mom Cathy who is currently fighting a form of cancer called Non-Hodgekins Lymphoma. I don’t think she knew that video games could make such a difference in people’s lives. Thanks to GamesDoneQuick for organizing this fantastic event for PreventCancer,. You’re doing great, mom! Keep up the fight!
Hey GDQ! Wanted to give a shoutout to the GDQ discord for being awesome folks year are year. The event wouldn't be as great year after year for me without you guys. Also thank you GDQ for 10 years of running this. The last 2 years I had my aunt diagnosed with stage 4 Ovarian cancer. I want everyone to know no matter what amount you give, if you tune in, or if you tell your friends, being a part of this you are making a difference.
My first ever donation..... Never watched gdq before. Earning lots of girlfriend brownie points if we get the Pokemon tasbot on.
Watching with the family, looking forward to see pokemon blue.
My sister beat breast cancer back in 2013 and Pokémon blue was my favorite game as a kid. I missed that incentive so put this towards naming link honkwind!
To my best friend, Wendy. Cancer took you early. I will always love you.
We met the pokemon blue TAS so here's a donation to help make SMW one mind hard mode happen!

This was going to Pokemon Blue, but it's been met. So here's to the secret boss in Katana Zero!
You guys rock. Keep on being great.
This is to see some Sick Super Mario world skills. Its my favorite part of every Agdq.
I tried to speed run this donation to get it in towards Pokemon Blue, but looks like I pulled a Keez and went over estimate. Oh well. Put this towards One Mind Hard Mode instead.
Work friend!
:3
That Donation train for TASBOT Pokemon went by so fast... So this one is to start the One Mind Hard Mode.
Donating to the 'make people hear my terrible puns' incentive (and to the goose): If TASbot ever gets a movie, will they be played by David TASselhoff?

Can I please get a HYPE?! LET'S DO THIS!
Way to go TAS Bot!
Yo, Drumboardist here! Just wanted to TIME in for a bit, and TAS'k y'all a question. Coolkid, you're a SUPER Mario runner. Dwango, you have FRAMED many a question about these runs. So if we had to put it to a poll, what are you twos' favorite runs, both RTA and TAS? I'll take my answer off of the air, in case there is a RECOUNT. I'd love to EMULATE either of you, but time-constraints often hinder me. But I'll work on it 'cause y'all are some REFRESHING folks. Don't mean to RELOAD anything I've asked you before.
Third time donating to GDQ. My girlfriend dislikes me watching but loves the cause. Continue the great work and punnishingly bad jokes.
Hey guys and girls!Love your event and had to donate. Greetings from Germany. Keep on the awesome work!
Second time donation in honor of my wife's father who was lost to brain cancer 3 years ago.
I'm so excited to see pokemon blue on the TAS Bot! Thank you so much to everyone running at GDQ and all of the donators. My mom kickstarted my love for gaming, and we lost her to cancer 7 years ago. Let's make this GDQ the best one yet! Oh, and HOOONNNKKK!!!
wish i could watch more of this event... love every minute i can see
Save the princess save the world
Awesome runs at an Awesome event, as always. This year, one of my resolutions is to actually submit a speedrun for a game. Here's hoping I can one day make my way there.
My sons Dex and Des just watched their first GDQ runs tonight. They are impressed by all the money coming in for Prevent Cancer. They are donating in memory of their Grandpa Bud. He drove a big truck. Honk! Honk!
EVERYBODY CHEATING BUT ME, WAAAAAAAA
This one's for Neil. RIP!
Profitons des talents de TASBot à finir des jeux très vite avant qu'il ne se décide à contrôler le monde ! (Quoique si il arrive à battre le cancer au passage c'est peut-être pas plus mal, au pire ce don pourra aider). Débizous LFR ! #CoeurBleu

Humans may have trouble with beating cancer, but TASbots should be able to do it just fine.
ONE MIND HARDMODE BABEYYYYYYY
I've been watching AGDQ and SGDQ for several years now, and always enjoyed watching these amazing people decimate my favorite games. Early last year, my father started to lose his sense of taste, and developed a small knot on his neck. On June 25th, 2019, he was diagnosed with throat cancer. Forty radiation treatments, six weeks of chemo, hundreds of miles driving back and forth to the hospital, and one feeding tube later, his scans came back completely clear as of December 12th last year.We've been blessed throughout the entire ordeal, both financially and with support from friends and family. He still has a ways to go in recovery, but the greatest Christmas gift I got this year was my dad being able to taste his favorite foods again, cancer free.Here's hoping this donation can help others reach a good conclusion like my dad, and beat cancer once and for all.
One mind is one of the coolest hacks of SMW to ever exist. Let's get it showcased by some of the best players to play the game!
There should be a comment here, but TASBot clipped through it.
No words can describe the honk that GDQ honks in my honk. C'mon and honk it!
Greetings from the Satellite of Love. Great to see TAS and honorary robot Glitchcat at GDQ. Even though robots can't get cancer I heard money can help prevent humans from getting it. So here's $25 I stole from Crow
Gotta throw down for SOOPAH MARIO BROTHERS 2 -- game of the year 5 years in a row baybee. Also, super hyped for Pokemon Blue. Onward to one mind!
A big Thank you to the runners, commentators, and everyone working behind the scenes. My heart is bursting with happiness because of this amazing community. Let's keep the energy up and the donations coming, everyone!
The best robot for my donation is the unstoppable dancing machine in the audience front row. He's the guardian spirit of GDQ.
hype honkkkkkkkkk!!!!!!
Go GDQ! Big thanks too all the volunteers, staff, and runners. Y'all own
Apres trois ans de AGDQ avec LeFrenchRestream je peux enfin faire un don.Merci encore pour ce restream de qualitay !#DVVol2
Happy to see Toad getting selected so often. Toad deserves more love, as does everyone who worked so hard to make this amazing TASblock! Greetings from the front row.
Grate event but when are you suppose to sleep.
I drove back from work and $100000 was raised? That’s crazy!! Good job everyone!
TAS Block never disappoints! I lost an aunt to ovarian cancer, and I hope nobody else ever loses a loved one to this terrible disease. Here's to petting the cat in Katana Zero, because all animals deserve some love.
Always a joy to see games being broken to the extreme, so here's a hundred towards the flying honker with no name. Now let's go catch 'em all before they can even start!
I was born the year Super Mario 2 released, 1988. I'm 31 years old now. Time goes so fast. Thanks for this GDQ and all the people who make it happen.

Je refais un don contre ce fléau qui a emporté deux de mes grands parents en 2018, je souhaite cela a personne #zhtDoom
good job you did it
Hey GDQ, I have something I feel it is important to share. I'm not sure if many of you have heard yet, but it was announced today that famous rock drummer Neal Peart from Rush has passed away after 3 and a half years fighting brain cancer. He inspired me so much in my life and I'm going to miss him. I remembered that GDQ was happening this week so I'm sending this donation in the hope that it helps prevent others from experiencing the same fate that my idol met. On a happier note, you guys are all awesome GDQ keep it up.

Yes we got the Pokemon Blue TAS!!! Hope we catch a HONKer! This going to having the any% Untitled Goose Game run in AGDQ 2020
Flappy hat forever
rip john
We donated to AGDQ in 2015 after our brother, son, husband, friend, and overall amazing human Erik Heppler was diagnosed with colon cancer. After six months of chemo, he was given the all clear. An avid gamer and retro console collector, he lived life to the fullest for 3 years until the cancer returned with a vengeance in 2018. Erik fought for his life for a year and a half, trying everything he could to stay with his family and raise his kids. After chemo, radiation, surgery, and clinical trials, his body succumbed to the cancer. We miss you, Erik. We hope this donation helps to prevent someone else from suffering as you did.
LE HONQUE
You all are doing such a tremendous job! VERY interested in the Mario 64 Randomizer -- looking forward to that tonight and to an entire Saturday off work to watch some amazing runs. Shout out to Mike, Teagan, and Rowan!

The world is finding out tonight, and I'm heartbroken. The band has suggested honoring him by donating to a cancer-related charity, so I'm going to do so here. If you can, donate $21.12 of your own. Let's not let the music stop.

My original comment was gonna be funnier, but you couldn't read it out loud.
Hi there! One donation for renaming the Skater "Poupou" in Tony Hawk's Project 8! It's a tribute to both Raymond Poulidor (nicknamed "Poupou"), a French cycling champion who died recently, and famous speedrunner Puwexil to whom we send our love. Shoutout to everyone for another great event! Gardez la pêche !
Honk!
Today I found out that the drummer of my favorite band, Neil Pearl has lost the battle to cancer, I’m saddened and just want to donate my money in his name, what you do at GDQ is amazing and is my favorite event of the year, thanks a lot for your work.
I hope our donations during this year's Pokemon/TAS block *rival* our *grassroots* donations from last year.
This is my first year watching AGDQ live. Linkus7 was the first speedrunner I ever watched, and I'm happy to actually get to donate for the run live this time! Good luck on the run and have fun! KABOOM!!
Thanks to my wife, Joscelin, for getting me interested in AGDQ! HONK!!
The band Rush asked that us fans make a donation to a cancer society of our choice in memory of Neil Peart. YYZ in Power.
This donation is in Honor of Neil Peart and his departure from this Material Plane, due to brain cancer, Darn You cancer, why must you be so cruel BibleThump and also HONK! :D
Fight me again you coward
Hlonk? No? ...ok.Thanks to Linkus and the whole Zelda speedrun community for keep wrecking the zelda games! Keep up the awesome work and good Luck on your run!
So excited to see Control being run at AGDQ! This donation goes to the Ashtray Maze run, one of the hypest moments of this incredible game. HYPE!
That was an awesome SMB2 run by TASBot. The game is critically underloved and this bizarre Mario non-Mario world is criminally unexplored by later titles. Who needs Yoshis when you have mini-ninjas doing jumping jacks?More broadly, GDQ has been a crucial part of keeping my spirits up this holiday season. My final grandparent passed away this holiday season (though not from cancer) at 96. Between this and season affective disorder, I nearly canceled all of my holiday plans and travel entirely. While I did eventually choose to see family, I did not buy presents for them. Instead, I got to save that money for GDQ and all the amazing work you do. The dedication of the runners and staff is amazing. Someone buy those backstage staffers a round of beer after this event is done!
This is for the person with the wholesome laugh in the back, thank you for making the TAS runs that much better!
Here's a $20.00 Donation. I am doing this for some of my family member that have passed away from Cancer itself. Cancer is a major threat to us all, Family, Friends and Ourselves. We will one day defeat and beat Cancer! May God bless us all and our loved ones!
Always enjoy GDQ and always donate a bit where I can. Keep up the good work all the runners and staff that bring us the show. Also HONK!!
$5 train for SMW One Mind Hard Mode!
Have watched many times. Have donate too little. Time to make amends.
Let's see that confusion in the Super Mario One Mind run!
Greetings from South Africa, its 3am over here, loving the show , you are all awesome , shout outs to my wife who is watching with me because she got a swollen eye !! love you babes, Ill take you to the Doctor in the morning. mwah
GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL
Link's Awakening is my favorite game. 2 tattoos and counting. Starting a train like spirit tracks!

Love watching TASBOT run Pokemon Blue. Brings back childhood memories. Also gday from Australia. I think im ment to say HOOOONNNKKK!
Thank for everything. You guys give me a reason to still love this things I do!
Very impressed with the TASBOT runs and seeing it run Pokémon Blue was incredible! Good luck to all the runners coming up and lets kick cancer in the butt!
<3
All aboard the $5 train towards GOOOOOOOOOOAAAAAAAALsville!
Time for some more Zelda jokes!How come pirates can't recite the alphabet?They keep getting lost at "C!"
One final donation for this GDQ using my real name - I've not been able to watch as much as I want but what I have seen has been INSANE.Thank you all so much for keeping this going strong for 10 years.
Wind waker is one of my favorite zeldas, and I got a question for one of my favorite people. Conbro be my best man please? Great job Linkus and lets take all the cancer and push it somewhere else
Thank you everyone that makes GDQ possible. An amazing way to raise money for an important cause. Good luck runners. Hoping to see the Link’s Awakening run!
Had to donate for the Link’s Awakening run - our pet cat Link crossed the Rainbow Bridge on New Year’s Eve - we sorely miss you buddy, this one’s for you.
Great week, great cause! Much love <3
Link’s Awakening on the original Game Boy was my first ever Zelda game, and I have loved the series ever since. Playing the remake was like a return to my childhood, and in a few years, it will be my son’s first Zelda game as well.
Boo cancerYay speedruns
Donating in honor of Neil Peart's memory. May you dine on honeydew and drink the milk of paradise.
Today’s my 33rd birthday and all I want is for more people to donate to this great cause!
Fun Fact: Drakonia is the German name for Dragon Roost Island. Now have fun with the run, everyone!
The original Link's Awakening was my first Legend of Zelda. I hope we can see the remake torn apart by a Speedrun!
Please everyone help "awaken" this donation incentive, donate now!
Taters!
Looking forward to the Wind Waker run! and to get a little ahead of it...PAUSA!! PAUSA!! PAUSA!!Let's get that Link's Awakening Run Met!
Hello GDQ from Thailand! Love what yall do and I hope you keep giving people hope of a future with no Cancer. Love yall!
These incentive goals are getting really crazy, but I am sure that we can beat them! Good luck Linkus, and remember: UWUI am going to donate more, depending on how amused I am by the pronounciation of my name.
Peace, love, and happiness to everyone!
There once was a boy so stronkWho swam so fast it was redonkHe did use a glitchBut don't be a snitchLest you face the wrath of the HONK!
Honk!
Gimme more TASbot! Hitting that 2.3 million target is EZ.
My son and I have been watching for the last three years and our favorite ones to watch is anything Zelda related. So of course we want this to go towards that Links Awakening run! Let's kick cancer in the nuts and watch some awesome games while we are at it!
Gotta get in on that tasty, tasty TAS Mario Maker run!
Link's Awakening holds a special place in my heart as the first video game I ever owned alongside my original Game Boy. I was 8 when I got it for my birthday, and I didn't end up finally beating the game until I was 13 - but making it to the end of such a long journey made it all the more worth it. I'm still terrible at Zelda games, but Link's Awakening will always be one of my favorites. So of course I want to see it crushed faster than I ever could! Keep up the awesome work and, uh, HONK!
Great event, year after year. Thaaaaaaank you!
Super excited for Linkus’ run of Wind Waker. Some of the craziest speedrun strats. Donation goes to runners choice
pausa
Been watching GDQ for several years now, and the more I watch the more I love it. Keep up the amazing work. Put this towards the 1 mind hard mode incentive. That doesn't seem like it should be possible, so let's watch it.
I had to miss the TAS Block - one of my constant highlights of GDQ - because of work. Unfortunate, but that isn't going to stop me from giving some money to the cause for what I'm sure will be a great VOD to watch later. Besides, there's still plenty more great speedrunning to come, including hopefully that Link's Awakening Remake run!
I look forward to this event every year! Thank you to everyone involved for all the good you do.
Je donne pour aider le meublage et pour le Parti Communiste Français
First time donating, had to get it in for Linkus' Wind Waker run! Good Luck! Donation goes to the amazing custom Zelda guitar!
Watching AGDQ with my wife after getting through the week sick. Great to see everyone donating and meeting the incentives. Heard the announcement for Link’s Awakening and knew we needed to chip in. Can’t wait to see this game destroyed! HYPE!
Alright Linkus, I'm ready to lose my mind over ANOTHER world record. Lets kill this dead category again :D
One more million for the final goal? Here's my 0.01%

Finally, I get to be a part of AGDQ as it happens! Keep doing the good things you do!
Two of my favorites! Zelda and Dark Souls coming up! Best of luck to the runners!
Sully, remember when I promised to kill you last? I LIED.
GDQ has been a highlight of my year for almost a decade now! I'm so happy to help contribute to such a special cause. Thank you to all of the runners, hosts, and staff for all of their hard work to put on this amazing show! :)
It's not a lot but I just got my bonus today and wanted to contribute to the one mind hard mode. Let's beat cancer by being awesome.
Good luck Linkus! Wind Waker has had a lot of great development in the last few years, can't wait to see what's new in this run. Good luck!Put it towards the Bonus Any% Goose Game Glitched Run! Honk!(If the GDQ site adds numbers to my name ignore them, it's simply TheMasterDS)
Shoutouts to all the people behind the scenes making the stream run so smoothly. The amount of work required must be incredible and you guys make it look easy! Keep up the good work!Honk!
Have to donate now to keep the hype going to get us to Super Mario Maker 2 TAS incentive goal! Lets smash targets!
Hey, GDQ. I'm a long time watcher, but first time donater. Satoru Iwata left us in 2015 and it's hard to believe it's been that long. Cancer has taken too many people and Iwata was one of them. Thanks for all you gave us, Iwata!
greetings from the crowd,long time donator first time watcher
This is but one of the legends of which the legends speak... but I've been waiting all week to donate to watch the speed run of my favorite game. My record to get off Outset Island was around 29 minutes, and It's awesome seeing that record demolished by Linkus on behalf of the Prevent Cancer Foundation. Cancer has affected my family a lot, but it's great we all can come together to support this great foundation.
Pausa Pausa Pausa Pausa Pausa Honk Pausa

This donation is for my Grandfather who is now living with Terminal Leukemia. He is living his life to his fullest. Love watching every year and racing to put a stop to cancer.
So glad I'm able to tune in for Wind Waker this AGDQ! Thank you to all the staff, volunteers, and runners for all the hard work that goes into making this event great!
First time donating. Love this marathon and all you do for charity. Let's see that Link's Awakening run!
Link's Awaking was my favorite Zelda game, was stoked to play the remake, and can't wait to see it run as the bonus game.
Windwaker was my Gateway drug into the wonderful world of Zelda. This series is what has helped My brothers and I bond stay Connected. Makar has always been an adorbale sage and I adore his jingle walk.
I am an intergalactic space lord, leader of the gremloids. I want to see you break link's awakenning.
Such an amazing event, big up to all the people making this possible
Honk
Cant wait for LoZ Wind waker run! Good luck and thank you to everyone at GDQ! <3
This donation is to remind Linkus to bonk for charity! I will donate an additional $5 for every HONK... sorry, I mean BONK that he makes. Good luck on your run Linkus, donation goes to runner's choice of incentive.
Very excited for the Super Metroid Impossible run. Thanks to the runners and everyone involved in this amazing event!
Every GDQ is an absolute joy and this one doesn't disappoint! I wanna see as much Untitled Goose Game as possible - let's try honking, that's a good trick!
Finally catching a run, and I'm glad it's one of my favorite Zelda games! Good luck, Linkus! May Pausa be on your side!
Wind Waker Hype !! Hi Linkus, stayed up late just to make sure I could catch your stream , been excited for it all week !! Do your best c:
I just HAD to donate during Linkus7's run of The Wind Waker. Linkus, my boyfriend and I became fans of yours months back when you beat the world record in September after I happened to come across it while looking for speedruns to watch. The funny thing is, I had to block the TV during certain cutscenes of the game, because my boyfriend was actually planning on playing through Wind Waker for the first time during his visit with me, since he never had the opportunity to play it when he was younger. It compelled him to play the game, because he wanted to watch more speedruns it. We were lucky enough to watch your current PB last month before he had to go back home. And even though we're a country apart, we're watching this run together wishing you the best!I love you, Eder! P.S. I'll donate another $5 if Mr. Game and Shout can pronounce his name right. Let's work together to stop cancer! Also, HONK HYPE!
Been watching all week and excited to relax on a Friday night with my favorite New Year's tradition, the wonderful AGDQ. Put this toward Mario World One Mind Hard Mode -- or should I say One Mind HONK Mode?
Let's get to 2 mill!!
So hype for this Wind Waker run by, the one, the only, world record holder, the Swedish Sniper LINKUS! Good luck, Paula-Honk
Thank's for all, you're awesome !!!!
This donation is for my mother Linda who is being treated for lung cancer. New research and treatments are saving her life. I asked friends and family to chip in, and if I raised a thousand dollars I promised them I would shave my head! Well, they came through. I'm shaving my head this weekend. Supporting Prevent Cancer Foundation makes being bald completely worth it! Love you, Mom! Could the crowd "HONK!" to scare off cancer?
Zelda is my favorite game series so I gotta donate during Wind Waker, and Link's Awakening is one of my favorite Zelda games, so let's get that bonus run!
What time does the Twilight Princess go to sleep? At MIDNAit

My Dad went through prostate cancer a few years ago and luckily beat it and is in complete remission. I hope for a world soon where every family who has to experience the horrors of cancer can say their loved one beat the cancer. I love this event and will continue watching every year to support all the good it does.
Wind Waker is one of my favorite games ever so of course I had to donate! Let's stop Ganondorf AND cancer! H O N K!
Shout out to Linkus from the audience! Had to donate during my favorite run with my favorite speedrunner!

Gotta donate for a chance on these sweet, sweet Zelda prizes. Also, gotta get that Link's Awakening run!

Great time, great cause. Let’s go Linkus. Can’t wait to see the Swedish sniper in action.
Honk.
A 2.3 million dollar milestone?! Let's do this! Shoutout to my friends Jeff and Eric in the crowd, hope you all are having a great time! Donation goes to making the "One Mind" run of Super Mario World a Hard Mode run, because who doesn't want to see that?!
In memory of Neil Peart
My mom loved Zelda, but she died of cancer in November. I wish I could watch this brilliant Wind Waker run with her, but in lieu of that, it's my honor to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation in her memory. Good luck, Linkus7, and let's get that Link's Awakening run, and then that super bonus milestone! <HONK>
Good luck Linkus7, I am a long time watcher first timer doner. I’ve watched your streams for 7 months now.

GDQ is what brought me to Linkus7 and I'm so lucky it did! Linkus has kept me at the edge of my seat and I'm so excited for 150,000 people to experience that feeling with me during this run. Let's go, Linkus! SPLOOSH KA-BOOM
Getting an early donation in toward Link's Awakening. It's a lofty goal, but I know we can get it done! Awaken that Wind Fish!

Been watching AGDQ (and Linkus) for years, but this is my first time watching while awaiting a cancer diagnosis. My next appointment is still a month away, and I'm terrified. Can I get a $5 donation train for encouragement and good luck?
Hey Linkus! Good luck on the run today. Let's make cancer as non-existent as Ganondorf will be in about 90 minutes. ORRRRRRRB. OOOOOOOI.
Wind Waker was the first Zelda game my wife and I played together when we started dating 16 years ago. So it seemed appropriate for it to be when i make my first donation for GDQ, from our first GDQ that we’re attending together with our kid. Thanks for all you do, good luck to the runners....donation towards Links awakening ...oh. And HONK!
Beating out cancer and great games done quick? Honk to that I say! Good luck on the Wind Waker run! Oyyyyeeee!!
Wind Waker is my favorite game of my favorite series, thank you and good luck, Runner!
Recently got a raise so figured I should pass along some of this WINDfall to a good cause, because that’s what charity is all aBOAT. Looking forward to seeing Wind Waker get rudderly destroyed and smooth sailing to the runner!
Hey guys, long time donator, fourth time donator. It gives me great joy to save to a great cause. Greetings from Australia. PS: view the frames, kill the frames.
Long time watcher, first time donater. Much love to all those who work behind the scenes making the stream and game setups smooth. Honk!
So I get to see Wind Waker being run while I am in Italy, and the game isn't even run in italian this time? I demand my PAUSA!
OYYYYY!! But, really HONKKKK!
Had to donate during the Wind Waker Stream, after watching so many Linkus7 streams. So good luck and show Ganondorf why you are called the Swedish Sniper!
Hey there AGDQ! fluxating here. I'm currently sitting here watching Wind Waker with my friends, celebrating our new tradition of watching the run together every year. I'm donating this in honor of my grandfather and great aunt, who passed away from both liver and brain cancer respectively. Let's try to hit 1.5 mil and KABOOM cancer!
Look forward to the Windwaker run every GDQ! Good luck Linkus and love from Australia!
Wind Waker was such a surprise for me, when I first saw the trailer I was really bummed at the aesthetics but it became one of my favorite games of all time, good luck on the run!
A Speed run for Link's Awakening (Switch)?!? Now this is a good reason for my first ever donation to AGDQ!
Can't believe it's only been a few years since Linkus showed off a FIVE-hour run of Wind Waker HD. Love to see how research makes these runs faster at the same time that cancer research helps save lives. Donating in honor of my Aunt Alice and my girlfriend's great aunt, who both died of cancer in our childhoods. As we continue to break these games, let's all break cancer for good. Thanks again for a great marathon. Good luck, Linkus.
Had to donate during a run of one of my favorite games of all time. 3 time cancer survivor, thank you to everyone involved in GDQ, this has become a special event for me.
It's dangerous to go alone! Take this.
Watching AGDQ has become a tradition in our family. Both my husband’s family and mine have been touched by cancer. Thank you to all the runners, staff, and everyone involved with making these events happen.
Can never get enough of Zelda! Love Linkus and Gymnast! SUPA SWIIIIIIM!
OOOOOOOIIIIILoved your last run last GDQ! Wind Waker is my favorite game of all time so I can't wait to see it get absolutely destroyed again
Good to see Linkus speedrun windwaker again! I saw your speedrun a year ago, and for an entire year, "Kaboom!!" has been stuck in my head. I blame you and you alone for this, and it's fantastic. Here's to another year of Kaboom!
Hey! Listen! Hooooooonk
Let's show some love to all the hosts for the prize show cases this year. Very entertaining and a fantastic job to all GDQ staff this year!
RIP Pausa
OOOOOI! Looooong time watcher of these GDQs and proud to see this continue for amazing causes. Here's $20 for each year I've been cancer free, this year marking my 5th year in remission from Lymphoma. *HONK*
Here's to getting TGH back on stage for Link's Awakening! Thanks to all who put on this event and HONK
OIIIIIIIIIIIII
Hey you guys! Wind Waker was the first Zelda game I ever completed, and it's great to see it being played at AGDQ. My money is going towards that Super Mario incentive. Have a great run and Honk!
I've loved watching both Linkus and gymnast in their Legend of Zelda runs over the past few years. It's been amazing to see them break my favorite game series over and over again.Nice job on the Skyward Sword run earlier this week, gymnast, and good luck on the Wind Waker run, Linkus!
HONK!
No Pausa!?!? can we at least get an.....ORRRRB?
:)
Had to donate for one of my favorite Zelda games, good luck to Linkus on the run! Putting this towards another one of my favorites, the Link's Awakening bonus run.
Zelda runs are always the best! Let's honking beat cancer!
Thanks you for this great week full of nice runs!
I felt particularly inspired to do a donation during my husbands favorite Zelda game, Wind Waker. Because of organizations like pcf, he gets annual checks for various forms of cancer his family members have been diagnosed with and I’m so thankful for all you guys are doing.
Wait, so I can donate to beat cancer, for one mind hard mode SMW, and for the SMM2 TAS exhibition all at the same time? Deal of the century!
So excited to watch my favorite game get destroyed by one of my favorite runners ever. <3 Good luck Linkus!!!
that makar plush will look great in mah car! excited to catch linkus and wind waker live this year! good luck to all the runners and kill cancer
Good luck with the run Linkus! Let's see that new Deku tree skip skip pagchomp
My wife lost her father to cancer six years ago and a close friend was taken just days ago. GDQ's support of the Prevent Cancer Foundation is a wonderful reminder of the compassion and generosity of the speedrunning community. Thank you all. Now let's fragment memory, prevent cancer, skip barriers, and enjoy an amazing Wind Waker run!
<3
AGDQ has just been...awesome so far! I had to donate during the Wind Waker speed run. Good luck Linkus. Oh yeah...HONK!
I have been watching GDQ for about 8 years and have always wanted to donate. I recently lost my father to liver/brain cancer and couldn't think of a better time to try and kick cancers but. I would also like to thank Puwexil/Lackattack/Essentia and so many others for being so welcoming to their respective communities.
Pausa!
Donating to help give cancer the bonk. HONK!!
Whatever you do, don't let Tingle out of his cell! He's in there for a reason!!
Hyaaah Hyah Hyaaaah

Love watching Wind Waker runs, they get better every year! HOOOONK
Hey Linkus! (And Gym), first time donating at a GDQ and I had to do it during my favorite Zelda game. I’m glad I’m now in a position I can donate after watching for many years. Keep up the great runs!
Hoi!!!! There is nothing better than a Legend of Zelda Run at GDQ! Destroy Gannon-dork and destroy Cancer!
HYES
 (Comment rejected)
Happy to see you running this game that is my childhood. Time to fight cancer!Go, pajama hero!Hyah!
I love you, Linkus
Hi AGDQI’ve saved my donation for one of my all time favourite games. I’m sorry I can’t donate more however I’m between jobs at the moment and money is tighter than I’d like it to be. Watching both the twitch stream and vods have helped me through many a university project so I had to give what I can for this great cause. My mother is also a survivor of both lymphoma and breast cancer and so this event and the cause it supports hits really close to home. Donation goes to runners choice. #NoPausa
Me and my wife have been longtime watchers. Thank you to all of those that are involved in making this happen! Good luck to all the runners! Also, cancer sucks.
Hey Linkus! You may not recognize my name cause I typically lurk but had to donate while you were running! I joined your streams a few months back and absolutely love hanging out there; you and your community are so welcoming and pleasant! Good luck on the run man, much love!
YESSSSS it's Linkus and Gymnast! Sorry to do this, but: HONK! ka-BOOOOOM! Sploooosh!
PAUSA
The pause menu says "Korekuto" for "collect" in Japanese. So. KOREKUTO, KOREKUTO, KOREKUTO!
HONK HONK.......HONK
Been away on a work trip all week, glad to be back in time for the great runs tonight! Donation goes to the Link's Awakening bonus run in honor of the first Zelda game I ever played.
Linkus! Good luck. I love watching your run throughs of windwaker! You're so good at explaining everything and you're fun to watch! Bonus shout out to my wife, Prumm, whom I love very much.
YA HA HA!!! you found me. Oh wait wrong game.
My mother went for the results from her 14th anniversary of being free from cancer, and happily was told there wasn't anything there. Been a watcher of GDQ since 2013 and happy to watch another Zelda game get destroyed by Linkus7!
Proud to be able to help with such a great cause. Thank you all, speedrunners, organizers and the public to make this amazing event possible.
I want to see a Zelda timeline where a past Link abused a glitch to skip past the barrier. The sheer amount of *canon* in this series *dwarfs* anything I can imagine, though.Anyway, looks like the speedrun is going *swimmingly* so far. Good luck!
Finally able to donate, what better time than during Wind Waker with Linkus7? I've only seen HD runs, so I'm excited to see some new tricks! Good luck on the run! oh, and uh, HONK!
Thanks to the runners and everyone behind the scenes at GDQ for the endless entertainment.Putting this towards the any% goose game run, let's see that goose fly!
It's my best friend Greg's birthday this week happy birthday Moo!
Long time lurker, first time honk. Good luck to Linkus in crushing that wily barrier. Thanks to all the staff, crew, runners, and memes that make this amazing event possible! Honk Up, Beat Cancer!
Wind Waker is one of my favourite Zelda games, even if lacks chickens and geese. Good luck on your run and let's blow away cancer!
I begun to Speedrun, because of Linkus7's Wind Waker runs, so lets enjoy this awesome Speedrun and do something against cancer!
My mom passed away from cancer last year, so here’s 3 hearts worth of life in her memory. Can’t wait to see one of my favorite games get utterly broken in the name of preventing cancer!
Give that Helma-honk a good bonk!
So excited to see this speedrun of one of the best Zelda games of all time! Good luck Linkus! Ouiiiiii!!
Here's to Wind Waker! One of my fave Zelda games ever~ Thanks for the run!
I've been waiting the entire GDQ to watch this speedrun. My co-workers didn't understand why I was so excited to see someone play a video game as quick as possible. Good luck Linkus! You've got this!
As the Zelda franchise is what got me into speedrunning, it only makes sense to donate during this run. Here's to finding Cancer Research Barrier Skip.
Huge Zelda fan! Let's all chip in to help defeat cancer!
Started watching GDQ with my god brother the summer before I left for college, and I've been hooked ever since. Shoutout to you TJ, thanks for sharing this wonderful experience with me.
This is from my dog, Kirby.
I have been a big fan of GDQ and I love to see all the good video games can do. Wind Waker is by far my favorite Zelda game. I lost 2 grandparents this last year so I felt it was a good time to donate to a great cause. Let's ban cancer... and Ned.
I had to donate after hearing about the Link's Awakening Switch incentive. Link's Awakening for the Gameboy Color is one of my favourite games, so I decided to start speedrunning it last summer, so I'd love to see the switch version here at AGDQ. We reached huge incentive markers last year during SGDQ, so I know we can do it this year for AGDQ!
Marin dreams about becoming a seagull, we dream about defeating cancer. If we wish to the Windfish, I wonder if our dreams will come true. Donation towards getting that Link's Awakening run.
Donating with a bit of a humble brag here- I recently earned a Ph.D. in video game rhetoric, with my dissertation focusing on speedrunning techniques like barrier skip and several runs from AGDQ and SGDQ over the years. Thank you so much for inspiring my research! Gym and Linkus are some of my favorite runners, so I wanted to donate now to show my appreciation. Honk!
Go Linkus! May the Triforce be with you.
Hey all, Long time watcher, first time donor, Windwaker and Link's awakening are two of my favorite games of all time, so I figured it would be good to donate for one during the other! ALSO 2.4 MIL HOYYPE.
Pausa.... HONK!
Hoyyyy!
HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONK
Hey Linkus, been a fan since I saw your 100% wind waker run at last years AGDQ. Sadly I can't see the rest of this run live, but I'm looking forwards to seeing the video of it later!
i always love watching gdq; they’re super fun events to support such great causes. i’ve lost friends and family to cancer and have more fighting right now. thanks for raising money to stack the deck in our favor in the future. ♥️
Greetings from Germany, its 2:30 in the middle of the night, but for Zelda it's totally worth it. Now Sploooch the cancer and never pausa AGDQ, I love you mydudes!
Accidentally stayed up late enough to catch my two favourite Zelda speedrunners run one of my favourite Zelda games.Here's a yellow rupee towards the fight against cancer
Just had to donate during a Windwaker run with Linkus and Gymnast.Thanks for this awesome event enjoying every bit of it.I'm not gonna donate for honk... but i love the sound of sploosh and kaboom.Greetings from Germany.
Is HONK? This years KABOOM. Good luck to Linkus the rest of the runners and thanks to everyone who makes these runs possible./
Ok, so, I've made peace with no "pausa." Can I get a "sploosh" instead? Donation to get more Legend of Zelda in the marathon!
Girlfriend and i got out of bed at 2:30 tonight especially for this run! I have been watching for 4 years now and this is the first time watching with my girlfriend. Keep being awesome! And groetjes (greetings) from the Netherlands! HONK HONK HYEAAAAH!
Hey GDQ! I've been watching GDQ for years now and I feel like the Wind Waker deserves my first ever donation. It's not everyday you see kids swimming across oceans, right? Lycka till Linkus!
My dad lost his fight with cancer 5 years ago this month. I've been a fan for years of GDQ and love everything it does.
I remembered to nail down all my ikea furniture for deku tree skip. $20 more for a first try barrier skip! Good luck on the run!
There might not be any PAUSA but it's still for a good CAUSE-A.
Merci et bravo pour cet événement. Un gros GG aux speedrunners et speedrunneuses, ainsi qu'aux programmeurs de TASBot, magnifique spectacle pour lutter contre le cancer. #MarioLight

[enter cringe-worthy Zelda pun here]
This one goes out to all my friends and family whose lives have been affected by cancer. I hope one day we can go "Kooloo-Limpah!" and say goodbye to that horrible disease for good! Keep up the great work guys!
Sploooosh. Too soon?
This is one of many donations I have made this week in honor of my friend Andy, who passed away this past September from cancer. He fought for 2 and a half years. His loss still hurts but that means that donating at AGDQ is even more important to me than ever before. Put this towards the SMW Hard Mode run. And let's beat cancer for good! For Andy!
Wind Waker was the first game I have ever played and no matter how often I see speedruns of it I never get tired of super swims! Good Luck to Linkus7 and shout out to Mr. Game and Shout our amazing announcer!
Ho-oooiiii-nk!
I'm feeling a lot of HOIIIIIIIIIPE for this run!
Go linkus!
Been watching AGDQ since before we were married. Now we're finally in a position to donate. Hi Pooky! HONK
Hooooooooooy-nnnk!
Second time watcher and first time donater. Had to do it during my favourite game. Good luck on the run Linkus!!! HOOOOIIII
It was a good line about what time the Twilight Princess goes to sleep, but it missed one important thing. She doesn't get a lot of sleep because the wind wakes 'er
Donating during one of my favorite Zelda games I’ve never beaten, and towards my favorite Zelda ever Link’s Awakening, and most importantly, in honor of my Uncle currently battling Thymic cancer. Sploosh!
HOOOOINK
Good luck Linkus!! You the best!
For my favorite girls, Beatrice and Violet, who are both _huge_ Zelda fans! Oyyyy!
Bonus games are best games.
Sploosh!
Zelda puns you say? I have a Medli of them. I could Goron and on and on, so don't get Impa-tient.
I grew up playing Links Awakening on my Game Boy, and getting to play the remake has been like a nostalgic dream. Now you're telling me I can watch it get broken to pieces for charity? Count me in.
In honor of Neil Peart's passing today from brain cancer. RIP to the greatest drummer. Thank you to everyone who helps make the GDQ events happen.
HONK!
For the kids kill cancer

I always love seeing Linkus run Wind Waker at GDQ, so I just had to make a donation. But where is my Pausa?!
Can we all give that OOOOIIII boy or girl a round of applause, that is so impressive. Also donation goes to naming the dark souls file Giantdad, because the legend never dies.
Super excited for the Wind Waker run! AGDQ is my favorite event of the year and the cause is super special to me. Here's one to kicking it to cancer!
If I see Linkus7 and Gymnast86 on screen together, I donate. There are no exceptions. Good luck with the puns! Er... I mean the run!

 (Comment rejected)
Orb Oy Honk Hype!
Always have to donate during my favorite run! Good luck Linkus, although I have no doubt you'll do awesome like every year!
I'm excited to see Linkus destroy the first Zelda game I ever completed!
Always a pleasure watching the Swedish Sniper destroy my favorite game. Keep up the great commentary and good luck with the rest of the run!
KABOOM?? SPLOOSH?? Maybe next time? Regardless, Linkus and the Windwaker run is my favourite. I’ve had an alarm on my phone since day one to make sure I didn’t miss it.
Had to donate during Linkus’s run! Always my favorite runs and I love watch Windwaker speedruns. Also putting this towards the Link’s Awakening bonus game. The game has come so far, Linkus is also the reason is started speedrunning Links Awakening! Keep up the amazing work Linkus!
Shout out to my housemate Nick who I know will be watching this run in the morning, gutted you're not up to watch Linkus smash Wind Waker too
My Aunt is currently battling pancreatic cancer and 5 of my family members have already beaten various forms of cancer thanks to early detection. Keep up the great work everyone!

Hello! Long time watcher, first time catching the event live. I had to donate during this run, Linkus's Wind Waker 100% was my first GDQ run. I really want to start speedrunning. Anyway, good luck Linkus! Kabloom!!
Merci a tous pour cette semaine de folie force et courage a vous tous ! Courage a toutes les personne atteinte du cancer force on vous aime <3 #AGDQ2k20
A 7 year old named Nathan has requested we donated; he loves The Legend of Zelda and he is constantly talking about how he would make his own Link game. He loves this event, and is watching with awe. Beat cancer, and may the power of the Triforce flow through Linkus!
I am constantly floored by how broken this game has gotten since playing it as a kid. I'll donate another $50 if the audience gives me their best Link void-out scream. Thanks to Linkus7, the staff and everyone who helps make this event happen. Let's beat cancer! Honk!
I memory of my father who passed away from cancer in 2018. Thank you to everyone at GDQ for hours and hours of runs to occupy me during his years of treatment. Zelda was the series that introduced me to speedrunning and Wind Waker is my favorite so it was the best time to donate. Keep on gaming everyone and lets break cancer like we break developer intended game sequencing and lets get that One Mind run because that sound nuts.
I sat down to make my donation when my WiFi went out, so I resolved to pay $1 for every minute it was down. It came back up 40 seconds later, so let's donate $1/second instead.Let's get that One Mind Hard Mode!
Hey, listen! Need some help to NAVIgate the ocean? You just have to follow the OOOOOYYYY!
Wooh!! Will double donation if you shoutout to Marcus, the bestest in the world. :D
My name is Julia and I’m 6 years old. My dad is letting me stay up to watch this Zelda speed run. I really want to be a speed runner when I grow up. Here’s $25 for Link’s Awakening.
Doot Doot
One Mind Hard Mode sounds like the perfect chance to finish Mario for good. He'll be helpless!
Have to donate while watching my two favourite Zelda streamers!
Watching Linkus complete the "pausa" last year was hilarious and really hooked our attention, but the barrier skip BLEW MY MIND!! Linkus is such an amazing speedrunner and we love watching you play windwaker! HONK
Had to donate during Wind Waker, after all, our pup is named after Tetra!Let's get the Dyna-Mite video incentive for Control, I promise it's very worth it.
gotta get that Links Awakening bonus game incentive
Wind Waker is my great white whale of Zelda games, the only one I’ve never had the opportunity to play. I love watching it get broken, but it only reignites the itch to get my hands on it! Thanks for running this game and thanks for doing it in the name of such an amazing cause.
It's dangerous to go alone ! Take this ! Greetings from France, Oooooooooooooiiii !!!!
For George!
SPLOOOOSH!
Nice to wake up perfectly for one of my favorite speedrun. Have a great event Linkus and Gymnast.
Hey Linkus!! Long time watcher, first time donator (other than prime subs) and I waited specifically for this run because I love zelda, and windwaker was the first zelda I ever beat, and the one that made me fall in love with the series. I love gdq, me and my boyfriend try to watch as much as we can since we first found out about it, and your 2018 pausa run is one of my all time favorites! Hey Linkus!!

Long-time watcher, first-time donator. Had to donate during my favorite game of all-time.
I guess Gymnast is there for you if your nose isn't
Greetings from Germany ! Hope everyone is doing well ^^ So nice to see my both favourite Streamers Linkus and Gymnast sitting together and speedrun my most favourite games at GDQ. Good luck and have a great time ^^
Let's goooooooo
For Neil Peart.
More Zelda of course needs more donations! I haven’t been able to watch much live, but I wouldn’t miss seeing Wind Waker being broken for the world. Good luck on the run Linkus7! Honk? Oyyy? Honkoyyyyyy!!!
I love you all!
My dad lost his fight 5 years ago this month from cancer. I have been a fan of GDQ for a long time and love everything they do for these charities!
Every year, I look forward to watching GDQ with my husband. I decided it was time to finally donate. To those in my life who are facing cancer and to those who were lost to cancer, this donation is for you.
Keep the puns coming. They make me happy, and I feel like they Linkus all together. (Sorry, not sorry.)
This is for the Links Awakening!!! Thank you for a wonderful way for my girlfriend and I to spend the evening!! Keep up the great work and good luck on the run!!!
Loving the windwaker run, loving the fight against cancer even more. Ill give another 5 bucks for an enthusiastic HIYA

Let's beat cancer!
Want to donate during one of my favourite Zeldas. Lost both my parents to lung cancer. This donation is memory of Bob and Sandy. My mom loved her Wii and DS.
Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda Game. It was such an honor to meet Gymnast and Linkus at TwitchCon! Good luck on the runs and shoutouts to all the amazing people attending, running, and putting on this amazing event!
Tingle Tuner is underrated. Nothing beats freezing Floormasters with ice arrows, then shattering them long-distance with a Tingle Bomb!
Linkus has got to be one of my favorite runners of GDQ! Thank you for helping to raise money every year for this great cause. You have amazing skills, a great personality, and your audience participation stat is maxed out. Oooorrrbbbb... Wait. I mean, Ooooiiii!
hoy fry. had to donate during Wind Waker, starring the most athletic Link in Hyrule history. this run is bonkers. RIP Neil Peart, let’s beat cancer!
I normally don't love glitchy speedruns but this wind waker run is positively joyful
Believe it or not I'm walking on air I never thought I could be so free flying away on a wing and a prayer. Who could I be? Believe it or not it's just HONK!
OI HONK HYYYYPE
Hey GDQ, first time catching this live. Love watching all the runners pull off amazing feats for such a good cause.Three years ago my brother was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer that had spread to the spine and brain. Spoiler alert, he's doing fine now. It was a rare form of cancer, with a unique genetic marker that only he had in the entire world. Thanks to the hard work of some of the very best doctors, they were able to tailor a treatment specific to his needs. He is now cancer free for the past 6 months.Cancer isn't one thing that can be treated, there are too many mutations and versions out there. But through tireless research and catching it early, people everywhere will have a better chance.I never really understood what we're all fighting for until it hit so close to home. So in honor of my brother coming out the other side, and for everyone else who will have to face the same battles, I want to do my small part.Also, Wind Waker is one of my favorite games, full stop. And I never tire of seeing it utterly demolished.Here's to fighting for more birthdays. Incentive goes to runner's choice!
I lost my mom to cancer less than a year ago. While it's been rough, watching all of the speedruns this week has brought back so many wonderful memories from my childhood. This is my first time watching a Windwaker run and I can't stop smiling. Thank you to Linkus and all of the streamers for supporting a great cause! Let's kick cancer's butt!
Greetings from Germany, just came home from and was ready to go to bed when I saw that my favorite childhood game get destroyed. Gues my nicht is Not over yet. Shoutout to everyone who make that event possible and support such a great cause!
Seriously, my husband & I are just legit impressed with the button mashing skills.
hyyyppppeeee
Its 2020, rupees can come in blue, Link has been awakened and over the cucu nest the windfish flew. Time to Honk at AGDQ.
Honk? Honk! (Ashtray Maze is so so cool, and we're so close to the incentive!)
Shout out to simple flips. Also, hey Dex!!
Je n'ai pas pu beaucoup regarder le marathon cause de partiels, c'est parti pour un gros week-end ! Et n'oubliez pas, hydratez vous ! #DVVol2
Any way we can get a shot of Linkus’s hands? Those inputs sound KILLER!
Good job, Linkus. Now make like a potato and mash!
Im happy to be here watching AGDQ and be able to support the prevent cancer run, even with such a small amount. I close family member was diagnosed with cancer at the end of this last year. Its taken its toll on all of us, and I want to do all I can to help. Here's to Linkus and AGDQ for being awesome!
Honk!!! just finished playing Wind Waker for the first time and am loving seeing LInkus crushing it! Lets kill cancer and Ganon!
Thank you for having such an easy name, Linkus! My grandma remembers is from the last time I showed her AGDQ!I don't think she knows what you are doing, but she's trying and I love it ! Greetings from Germany; its 3 am and I think I have to go to sleep... HONK
*honk*
Looking forward to the Control run, just finished the game and want everyone to see the Ashtray Maze!
Hey Linkus, Gym, which are cuter, Kikwis or Koroks? I love them both but Kikwis are bush penguins and therefore cuter.
I'm trying to focus on work for grad school, but GDQ keeps distracting me. However, I have absolutely no regrets! Thanks for the amazing Wind Waker run. Fingers of Steel!
Cancer is the worst. RIP Neil Peart.
Donating during wind waker because it is my favorite game of all time. Been lurking in the community for years and I have always loved watching this game get broken <3
Trans rights are human rights! ✊
Congrats GDQ on a decade on showing off great games and supporting great causes. Round of applause for the runners and crew who keep everything running. Since this is Wind Waker guess I will have to do this... Hyaa! Hyaa! Honk!!!
So glad I can donate more this time around for such an amazing event! So happy to watch amazing people doing amazing things for others! Good luck Linkus7 on the rest of the run, it has been stellar to watch so far!
This time last year I stayed up all night to watch Linkus’ 100% run. Two weeks later I found out I was pregnant, and now I’m watching after putting my 3 month old daughter to bed. I can’t wait to introduce her to this game someday and to all other zelda games. Heres to hoping that during her lifetime, cancer doesn’t mean what it means today.
Amazing zombie hover in Dragon Roost, go Linkus!
Hoyyyyyy!
We have been watching for years now and are so happy to see our favorite run literally a full hour shorter than before. Go fast! Honk!
Honk
I'd been looking forward to the Legend of PAUZA run all week, but Japanese text works, too! Good luck, Linkus, and let's get that Link's Awakening incentive met, everyone! I mean, it's more money for charity and a longer AGDQ - what's not to like?
I want to donate this in honor of all of the new friends I’ve made simply by joining a Legend of Zelda Discord on a whim this past summer. Thank you all, Satori Mountain, for being so welcoming, so creative, and so talented. Let’s all work together to defeat the real Ganon: cancer.
you guys rock
I lost my grandfather to cancer many years ago and almost lost my grandmother recently--she is thankfully in remission as of a few months ago. My husband and I watch every year and had to donate to a wonderful cause! Thank you for everything you do GDQ!
Donating in memory of my step-mom. Cancer took her from us a few years ago. Looking forward to the day when it wont be able to take anyone else ever again.
For Neil Peart. Your drumming was otherworldly and your lyrics timeless and poingnant. You will live forever through your music. Be at peace, brother, and rock on, forever.
HELP! my furniture is dancing away.
Shout out to this banger of a run. HONK
O man all our ikea furniture just moved. Linkus what do we do?!?!? Good luck on the run and best way to finish the work week.
<3
Let's go linkus!
Linkus is a button-mashing god.
Thanks for the Swedish lesson.
Hi Linkus7. Can you tell my IKEA furniture to stop moving around?
Someone stop this Swedish sorcery.! Say the sacred words to purge this witchcraft. HOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOONNNNNNNNNNNNNNK
Next week, my dad is having a procedure done to treat a persistent bit of cancer that they are struggling to get rid of, so it feels right to send a donation to fight cancer during one of my favorite Zelda games, and the run I always try and watch every GDQ. Thank you and keep being awesome.
Thanks Linkus. My couch can now cook and the chair dance macarena. Gl for the rest of the run.
Always love seeing wind waker speedruns to watch Link nyoom through the water and supersonic speeds.Wishing the best of luck to the runner, keep up the good work!
Wanna say thanks to all the people working behind the scenes To make gdq amazing, Keep it up my dudes
OG Wind Waker in an hour and a half?? That's honkin' unbelievable! HOOOOOOOOOOK!!
I always enjoy watching these events. Thanks to thew crew and everyone behind the scenes that keep things running smoothly all week, y'all are awesome.
Had to donate after the Swedish counting in Wind Waker. Incredible Swede-running at this event! Put this toward runner's choice!
I'M FREEEEEEEE HAHAHAHAHAHA
Great show so far, thanks!
Linkus and Gymnast runs are always amazing to watch - great running and great commentary. Oyyyyyyy!
Woke up at 3am to be sure to catch this Wind Waker run, it's one of my favourite games. This is so much fun! Good luck on the run neighbour, love from Finland!
My favorite Zelda joke: Why hasn't Link heard about the Gorons? They're too underground. Great run, Linkus!
Well my coffee table just stole my wallet, but aside from that this run is awesome. Amazing consistency.
Hey GDQ; long time lurker, first time donator. Wind Waker is my favorite game from my childhood. While I've spread the word of GDQ's amazing achievements for years to anyone who would listen to me, I have been unable to donate personally; I wanted my first donation to be during this run. This Monday, my best friends' mother passed after a long battle with cancer, and this donation is in honor of both my friend and his mother. Thank you for every donation that's come through, and if you're unable to donate, please spread word of this marathon and their amazing goal to everyone you can to continue it's growth. Thank you to the runners for your amazing dedication, the attendees for your in person support, and the staff of GDQ for putting together such an amazing marathon. I love you all.
What an amazing event as always, kudos to everyone that helped make this happen, here’s to hitting $2.3million, we can do it!! HONK!!!
$70 for the lesson on counting to 70 in Swedish!
Donating another $50 to see the cutest zelda game ever made, Link's Awakening, played. Also donating in honor of my uncle, whose cancer has resurfaced. This event has come at the perfect time for my family and is nice to see. Kick cancer in the HONK.
Can we get a 20.20 chain going?
So amazing to see all these tricks done live! Keep up the great work linkus!
New route with the same 2 Wind Waker runners I've loved watching all this time. Count this as 25 more dollars toward beating cancer once and for all.
First donation ever, I'm happy that it could help someone in some way.
Oi! Donating for one of my favorite runners, Linkus. Seriously enjoying the commentary for this insane Wind Waker run. Now I am going to pull out my 70 invisible coffees and stay up all night to not miss a moment of these runs!
Hope the Wind Waker run is as super as Link’s swimming! Good luck!
This donation is for Neil Peart who recently lost his battle with brain cancer
Those out-of-bounds meatballs are quite powerful! Good luck with the run!
Pausa! Pausa! Wait, there's no pausa? Oh well, here's $25 towards that Link's Awakening speed run! Keep up the great work everyone!
AYAYA
Three years ago my father was diagnosed with Stage 4 Melanoma. These years have been very emotionally taxing as he has gone through immunotherapy. For the last year, he has been cancer free thanks to the amazing cancer research done across the globe, and I'm hoping he can continue being cancer free thanks to events like this helping any sort of funding. Thank you all so much for hosting this, I hope that one day nobody will have to suffer having themselves or a family member have this terrible disease. Lets all beat cancer together!
My mom’s favorite game is The Wind Waker, so donations for me were necessary. Thanks for making everyone’s lives a little bit better, GDQ! Hoooooonk!!
My brother and I have been watching all week and I thought I should donate for bringing us together this week.
Really big fan of the commentary on this Zelda run. Also, really excited for the One Mind coop run coming up. Shoutouts to Five Oh Two Krew.
RIP Neil
 (Comment rejected)
First time watching live and first time donating! This event is incredible and I'm super grateful for all of you making it possible. My mom was diagnosed with mesostatic breast cancer nearly 6 years ago, and she is still fighting. It's awesome to see rad speedruns done to help fight for a cause that is so important to me and my family. To quote my mom, "cancer sucks!" Keep rockin' guys, good luck on the rest of the run!
From the family of a 2 time cancer survivor
Always love seeing my all time favorite game at AGDQ! Good luck Linkus! OIIIIIIIIII!!!!
Hey Linkus, amazing work on your speedrun of Wind Waker this year at AGDQ! I've been following your runs for a good while now, and this one has to be one of the most entertaining and best speed runs I've seen for this game. Thank you to everyone at GDQ who are supporting this event and helping to fight cancer!
<3
These memory corruption tricks are so cool it reminds me of ... ... ... I forgot
Linkus... Of course you have Starbucks, you dank memer...
Donating to help beat cancer? Oooh, thank you!

Good luck for the rest of the run Linkus! Gotta get that Link’s Awakening run

Hey Linkus, best of luck with the run. I will donate another $50 if you are able to get first try barrier skip. The company I work for will match my donations so LETS GO
The first game where I tried glitches was wind Waker. Now we finally have Barrier Skip and storage in the same game! Let's keep going and kick cancer's butt!
Had to get a donation in during one of my favorite Zelda games! Keep it going~
Been watching your other GDQ runs and have fallen in loveKeep up the awesome work at destroying this game! Honk
great speedruns for a even greater cause. enjoying the enormous amount of awesome runs the last 4 years. thank you for doing this event. also thank you to linkus7 for an amazing wind waker run and explaning what is going on here. greetings from germany and hoooooooooonk
This Wind Waker speedrun is blowing my mind. It's come a long way from the 4+ hour runs I remember from a few years ago.
I leave this donation to my mentor who passed away after a long tumultuous battle with brain cancer. This is for you Mike!Keep up the great work Games done quick and Good luck Linkus!!
Linkus - can you please tell all my furniture to go back to where it was? I'm feeling a little cramped right now.
This is the first time I am seeing WW being run, and I am honestly blown away. LINKUS7 is amazing. This is truly fascinating stuff. Way to go!
This is my first time donating. I was lucky enough to attend SGDQ in person last year and this is my first time watching AGDQ live. Love watching these amazing runs and I’m so excited to be a part of this Love watching these amazing runs and I’m so excited to be a part of this Amazing community.
Donating for my sister Lindsay who passed at 24 years old after a 20 year battle with cancer. Let’s go for that Link’s Awakening run!
I've already donated a couple of times this GDQ, but I've decided to chip in a little more in order to share a story of my incredible intelligence with the world. I was watching the stream and greatly enjoying this amazing Windwaker run, when I started hearing a suspicious "EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE" tone in the background. I sat there for a solid fifteen seconds, thinking, "Huh, that's an odd noise Windwaker is making..." before realizing it was the fire alarm and I had to evacuate the building as soon as possible.Truly not my proudest moment. Now that everything is OK (it was a false alarm!), here's $25 because this run is so good it could have killed me. Happy 10th anniversary, AGDQ! and... HOOOOOOIIIIIIII!
Honk Cancer!
Thank you all for this great event and for supporting this cause. Windwaker was the first Zelda game I beat and holds a special place for me.
Greetings from Windfall Island! Long time watcher, first time SPLOOSH-ER. Let's keep up the good energy and beat cancer once and for all! KABOOM!
linkusHONK
I've lost an uncle, two aunts, and my father to cancer. There's no way I couldn't donate during this event. Here's to everyone ever touched by this terrible disease. Thanks to all the runners & volunteers working to crash cancer once and for all!Also, honk.
1 item slide, 2 streamers, a romance. Haha just kidding i love you both. Keep up the good work Linkus uwu
Had to donate during the Wind Waker run! Linkus is my absolute favorite Zelda speedrunner and I wish I could be at GDQ in person to cheer him on. :) Best of luck with the run!
Had to donate while Linkus was running my favorite game as a kid! Shout outs to everyone commentating, running and helping out with AGDQ this year - you're all putting on an incredible week of entertainment, and doing something great for the world.
Had to donate at my favorite video game series, The Legend of Zelda. Good luck to Linkus, which is a great zelda speedrunner, and also all the other runners! Let's go Link's Awakening! Also....let's HONK the cancer away!
Pausa! Linkus and Gymnast are like peanut butter and jelly! This is my first donation to GDQ, and it is in honor of the great Neil Peart! Good luck guys!
Wind Waker runs have gotten insane.
Greetings from Northwest Arkansas! I am a long time watcher, first time donating. I love watching Zelda runs, especially if they are by Linkus or Gymnast, and I look forward to them all week. Good luck and HONK!
Thanks to cancer research, many years ago my mom was able to defeat breast cancer. It was a heck of a battle & she's never been the same since. I hope that with more research others can recover a bit easier than it was for my mom. Thank you speed runners and everyone who's donated for representing the gaming community in a positive manner!
Let's beat cancer! Hoooyyy!!
Awesome run Linkus!
Does this mean Link makes Hyrule more corrupt than Ganon?Are we the bad guys?
hi everyone! this is my first time donating, and boy does it have a special meaning. back in october, my mother was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer, a type that attacks non-smokers. you can imagine it was a big shock. linkus is one of my favorite speedrunners and wind waker is my favorite zelda game, so donating during his run was the perfect time. i want to thank all of GDQ for the amazing work they're doing, and i want to wish linkus and all the runners good luck in their runs. HOOOOOYY!!!!
First time donating. Just heard about Neil Peart's passing. Let's kick cancer's butt!
My best friend died last year to stage 4 pancreatic cancer. By the time they found it, she only had 2 months to live. This donation is so other people don't have to go through that experience.
Both my mom and best friend are here today due to early detection and proactive measures. Thanks for such a fun week of breaking games for a good cause. Honk!
Go Linkus!
Linkus is just a joy to watch every time he runs! Thank you to everyone involved for this incredible event! Huge shoutout to the crowd for that energy! HYPES AND HONKS!
OOOOOIIIIIIIIINNNNNK
I look forward to Linkus's Wind Waker runs every GDQ, and seeing the barrier skip in action after all these years... I'm def feeling emotional. Thanks for the great runs over the years and here's to many more!
I had to donate during one of my favorite games of all time! Just had a dear friend beat cancer like a champion! Great job on the run! Big thanks to the production crew for an amazing week of runs! You are all rockstars!
Love GDQ and love Wind Waker! Keep up the great work Linkus!
Thanks for all the entertaining and inspiring Zelda runs this GDQ! Can't get enough. Here's hoping even small donations count toward getting the Link's Awakening incentive.
In honor of Neil Peart, the greatest drummer of all time. Rest in peace.
OOOOOOYYYYYY
Almost missed Wind Waker, but now I'm able to watch it and I want to donate during the run of my favorite game. In my opinion GDQ is one of the best charity events around the world! Good luck for the Ganon Fight Linkus, you're awesome.
I've been waiting for a Link's Awakening run since the day the game was released!
Hey AGDQ! Wind Waker was one of my favorite GameCube games growing up. This is so cool to watch. Shout-out to this run for being one of the most sperg-tastic, mind bending runs I've ever seen at a GDQ event.
It's dangerous to go alone, here's $20
Fantastic run!! Linkus, your commenting is great!! Thanks everyone for putting this event up for a great cause!!
Hey guys, I remember watching when the venue was just one small couch. We've come so far and I'm finally able to donate more and more, I know my donation is only 1 drop in the bucket but my grandmother was just diagnosed with breast cancer 2 months ago. luckily it was found really early and she is on her way to recovery, I wish everyone could have success stories like this. Thanks for everything you all do.
In memory of the legendary Neil Peart, who passed away this week due to brain cancer. Air-drum to some "Spirit of Radio" or "Tom Sawyer" this weekend!
Do you think the Goose could put the Link in the Lake? (Honk.)
For my favorite Zelda game! HONKKKKKKK
Hey gdq, had to donate during my favorite zelda game. My family has been pledged with cancer from skin to bone and everything in between so lets get rid of cancer.
Toss a coin to beat the cancer oh valley of plenty
It's all in the soup.
This GDQ has been fantastic! Good luck to all the runners and I have loved all the Legend of Zelda runs, including linkus on the wind waker one.
Let’s see Link’s Awakening!
Long time watcher, first time donator. I love GDQ, I tell many people about it and look forward to it every year. I love what you guys do, and I love the community. Thank you so much, and Good Luck.
You load stuff and fragment the memory until you are just barely out of memory?As a programmer and hobbyist gamedev, this has just become my favorite speedrun !Linkus, amazing commentary and good luck on the rest of the run!
My mother in law is terminal. It has been a long grueling process. So, many thanks to everyone for fun times and love!!!!! It helps in so many ways and you guys always do an AMAZING job! Xoxo
Love watching these Zelda runs. But where's the incentive for BotW 100%??
Had to donate for Linkus, my favorite streamer! And Thank you everyone behind the scenes for everything you do, GDQ wouldn’t be possible without you!
Wind Waker was the first game that introduced me to speed running. It's crazy to see how far it's gone.
Why do the developers not simply download more RAM?
Amazed at how new glitches for Zelda keep getting found every year it seems. Great run so far Linkus!
Shout out to the moderator who tries to motivate everyone to "do the mario". Me and my sister spend hours in front of the tv dancing this to the end credits of the Super Mario Cartoon when we were children!
This donation goes out to my dad, who already beat cancer once but is fighting for his life once again. I am so moved by this event. So much positive energy from everyone all going towards a great cause. Let's kick cancer's butt together!
Love the Wind Waker. It was my first Zelda game I beat all the way to the end. Your technical explanations are so interesting even though I understand none of it. Been looking forward to LINKUS' run all week. And yes, I was looking forward to PAUSEA. R.I.P.
Many good times - thanks GDQ! Crowd ily <3
RIP to an amazing drummer Neil Peart from Rush who died today from brain cancer i'm beyond sad. Let's kick cancer in the butt
Haa! Hya! Honk!
We missed out one one of 2019's greatest gaming moments by not reaching the goal for Devil May Cry 5's Faust cutscene, but we can still see THE greatest gaming moment of 2019 with Control's Ashtray Maze, so my donation is going towards that! Keep up the great work!
Keep doing what you're doing, and get that Gannon! Also, get that One Mind incentive!
For Neil
Hey everyone. Great job on a great event, as always. Been watching since 2014. I'm donating this year in memory of Neil Peart, who died a few days ago after a three and a half year battle to brain cancer. As the drummer for Rush, he has inspired countless generations of musicians with his drumming virtuosity and lyrics. The world lost an incredibly positive presence to this awful disease, so I'm glad that we are doing what we can to make some future fatal cancer case the last one. Keep fighting!
Pray for Borls!
Since the game is not in Italian and so we don't get "Pausa", I present "Ichiji teishi" which is Japanese for Pause
go linkus! get that hover!
Love watching Linkus and Gymnast together for Windwaker and hearing the great commentary
$20 Dollars from my kids, Reilly and Corbett. I told them I’d match it if we can get a a big “HONK!!!!”
This Wind Waker speed run is the best of speed running: arcane knowledge, memory through training, and frame-perfect skills.
I just can’t get enough Legend of Zelda. Put this hundo towards the Link’s Awakening bonus run!
Just saw Linkus use Restricted Items; here's $50 in honor of the same glitch being in multiple Zelda games across multiple consoles!
Donating in honor of the thiccest Ganon. <3 Let's make that bonus game happen!
Hoynk!
Great run of Zelda, but i missed the Sploosh, well maybe a Honk can fix it. A shoutout to a friend that often says:"Uncle Ronny, but I thought... I believed..."
Had to donate for this amazing Wind Waker run, thanks to the runners and everyone making agdq possible!
Been waiting for wind waker to make my dono! Very excited to see this, and how great gamers have done at raising money
EEYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!
FIRST TRY
I've been watching all week and loving every speedrun! My dad is currently battling Lymphoma Cancer, so this cause is very close to my heart. Here's to kicking cancer's butt this GDQ, and completely eliminating all types of cancer in the future! Also, HONK!!!!!
Oh wow. I'm glad I stayed awake for this one.
Amazing run Linkus! Nothing better than sitting with friends watching amazing runs. Good luck to all the remaining runners and let's unlock this super bonus game challenge...HONKKKK
Always love watching Zelda at GDQ
Linkus is amazing! Wow! Also whoever in the audience in doing that Hoy is amazing.
It's great to see Linkus save all the frames on Wind Waker! Now that I am a doctor I can treat the cancer in the hospital andAND donate to help prevent the cancer while saving the frames. Let's help Wake Link up.
Incredible Wind Waker run! Linkus is a beast!
One of my favorite weeks of the year!!! So sad it's almost over. So impressive watching so many games that crushed me is a kid get owned by these runners. I sunk hours and hours into Wind Waker and never finished, and Linkus will finish in well under 2... So much fun watching all these talented runners showcasing their skills for a great cause. Thanks to all the runners, hosts, and volunteers for putting on this amazing event and for everyone that has donated as well. My company does a 2:1 match for charitable donations, so I will be submitting this for a match as well, and encourage everyone else donating to inquire about a match at your company. Hoping to make it to a GDQ event in person soon and looking forward to the Super Metroid Impossible run for the finale. Thanks again and God bless!!
I always loved how much heart Wind Waker has, how expressive Link is here, and the introduction of actual combat techniques. Here's hoping the Breath of the Wild sequel takes more cues from this game and Twilight Princess. Put my donation toward the Link's Awakening bonus game!
Had to donate during Linkus' run after enjoying his world record video so much! Thank you all for what you do and how much work has gone into the event. Peace be with you!
Excellent Windwaker run Linkus! That final climb through the tower was tense!
Hello from Brooklyn, NY! 🦆 🍎
We love you Linkus! OOOOOOOOOOOORB
Peace was never an option HONK!
Amazing work, very entertaining to watch and for a great cause!
Tingle potions? 40 Rupees. Ganondorf's laugh performed by the whole audience? Priceless.
I've been wanting to donate for a while, but hearing of Neil Peart's death really drove it home today. So many extraordinary people in our lives we love have been lost to cancer. I work with Middle Schoolers, and when we wrote down our greatest wishes, hopes, and prayers on pieces of paper today, some students wrote they wanted to see cancer cured. My heart aches for those who have personally lost loved ones to cancer. Here's hoping those children who hope cancer is cured can see it cured in their lifetime.I love you all.
Linkus's Windwaker runs are the absolute best speedruns I have ever seen. Congrats on another year, a perfect hover at the end, and may Pausa live on in our hearts. Donation to runner's choice.
Thanks to all the runners and the incredible crowd. HONK!!!
HONK!
Doing a zombie hover at the end of Wind Waker is one thing. Doing one while 160,000 people are watching is quite another. Well done, Linkus!
Great Wind Waker run and commentary by Linkus and Gymnast as usual! This was a great 10 years from GDQ, and I hope there's many more!
Big from the French Restream and shout out to my aunt who beat breast cancer, get checked moms & aunts!
Very excited to see the Super Mario 64 Randomizer speedrun from some of my favorite Mario 64 runners. Good luck.
That Wind Waker run was INSANE! Thank you Linkus! And thank you to all staff and tech behind the scenes who put on this event. This event is always great.
Have to donate for that Wind Waker run. Immaculate from start to finish. Well done, Linkus. Well done, AGDQ. Looking forward to Control later on, and I think we all could do with a little Dyna-mite!
this one's for that first try morth hover on the way to ganon!! GREAT JOB LINKUS!!!!
Stop waste your money for stuff u don't need or Fortnite 😉 and give it to people who actually needs it.
Looking forward to seeing how many borders we can get for those doctors this year!
Hi! Hope everyone's day has been great.
Here’s a quick $5 for my man DanceDad in the front row! Missed you man!
That legend of zelda wind waker run was probably my favorite GDQ run of all time, going to be hard to top that, thanks Linkus, thanks GDQ, lets Honk cancer away!
Never seen a OneMind run, but I want to see it as crazy as possible. Teamwork makes the dream work!
GDQ going good once again. so much respect for the runners and the people that make this happen.
Hoy!!!!
Awesome run Linkus! Your Wind Waker run was the first live gdq event I've ever watched, and you did not disappoint!
Cancer has taken so many of my family members, anything we can do to finally end this horrible disease is a wonderful thing. Thank you GDQ and every person who donates. This goes towards the One Mind Hard Mode. That sounds like the kind of insanity GDQ does best!
For makar! Wind water is one of my favorite games 💜
This is my girlfriend's first gdq experience. So happy to show her all these great games!
Been watching for years, but can finally donate! That Wind Waker run was mind-blowing, and I am super hyped for the Mario 64 Randomizer! Rooting for my dude Chrism! P.S. Shoutouts to Simpleflips

Root and stem!
Let's get that hard mode run of One Mind, gamers! Much love to everyone running and making this event possible.
Here's to 10 glorious years of *GDQ.Keep up the good work, y'all!Honk!
I think the only appropriate combination of "Mario" and "Luigi" is "Maluigi". Let's unlock that Hard Mode incentive!
Thanks to GDQ for hosting such an amazing event that helps make a boring work week that much more tolerable.Thanks to all the Runners, hosts and everyone who has donated so far!
Well after an interview like that, I cant leave this undone! Lets get that hard mode going! Also, I recommend Marowegi
Donating on behalf of my 7 year old daughter, who loves watching the runners "play the game the wrong way"
This is a shoutout to the amazing CarlSagan42, the coolest scientist who has time to sit down and play some video games for us. You have inspired me and so many others to study the wonderful world that is biology. Keep being awesome. Shoutouts to Carl, Poo, Ryu, Juz, and all the rest of the amazing runners; Shoutouts to the mario maker (2) community; and, most of all, shoutouts to GDQ. This donation goes to SMW One mind hard mode, because regular isn't bad enough.
I've gotta see hard mode on One Mind Super Mario World
Loving the show - keep up the great work!
That Windwaker run is my favorite run of the event so far--absolutely mind-blowing. Good job, Linkus!
Let's do this, hard mode one mind!
[insert a clever pun from the announcer here]
Come ooonnnnnnn OneMind Hard Mode!
If you remember the Super Mario Bros. Movie, the plumbers’ names are “Mario Mario” and “Luigi Mario”. Therefore, the combination abomination of the two shall henceforth be named “Luigi Mario Mario Mario”
Let’s get that Mario Maker bonus run!! GDQ HYPE!!!
If you're going to try, go all the way. Otherwise, don't even start. This could mean losing girlfriends, wives, relatives and maybe even your mind. It could mean not eating for three or four days. It could mean freezing on a park bench. It could mean jail. It could mean derision. It could mean mockery--isolation. Isolation is the gift.
Hey guys, Love what your doing here this is my first time seeing AGDQ live. Seeing the windwaker run just blew my mind! Sending love from New York.
This one mind run sounds WILD. Donating to make it harder.
One marathon, one goal, one cause, ONE MIND!
I am glad my husband introduced me to this event! We try to watch as much as we can every year. One of our favorite memories of GDQ was witnessing the donation train to the first 3 million total! Here is to millions more for charity!. Lets get to 3 millon and beyond.
[EN] Energy for the night ! :)[FR] Le don de la nuit pour redonner de l'énergie ! :)#MarioLight
It's crunch time at work so I haven't gotten to watch, but I wanted to stop by and donate so I can feel good about watching the VODs later!
Hello AGDQ, long-time watcher and donater here. My dad has recently been diagnosed with cancer but thankfully it was caught very early and he is well on his way to recovery. I want to thank everyone here for working so hard to make this event happen and for donating to such a good cause. Put this donation towards the Link's Awakening bonus game and I encourage everyone watching to donate to it as well because not only is it a great run, it also means AGDQ gets to last a little longer! :)
Let's make the runners really suffer during Super Mario World
Let's a-go
Ya-ha-ha
Here are 50 Rupees. Make the Link's Awakening run happen. Let's go! (And also the super secret bonus game)

For my mother-in-law, who has survived kidney cancer and two rounds of skin cancer. Thanks to all the donators and those who donate who help keep her in our lives for longer.
I'm a family medicine resident, and seeing the real-life suffering cancer causes makes it hard for me to watch scripted television. Instead, I watch speedruns, especially the GSA Mario 70 Star League. S/o to Simply for being the best race commentator out there. Your work helps at least one tired doctor rest at the end of some very bad days. Thank you.
I have fond memories of Super Mario 64 as a kid, watching my mom beat King Bob Omb for our first star. Last year she was diagnosed with cancer, and after a long fight, is currently in remission. So grateful for this event and all the good that comes of it. Let's keep crushing cancer, one power star at a time!
Honk!
All aboard the donation train! The requirement is only 5 dollars!

Been watching forever and glad to finally donate to such an amazing event
The world lost an absolute musical legend this week to cancer. This one goes out to Neil Peart of Rush, who helped shape and inspire many lives through his drumming, creativity, lyrics, composition and dedication to his craft. Huge thanks to GDQ for providing a venue for so many generous and wonderful people to fight and take our loved ones back from this awful sickness.

Hi everyone, here's to Linkus' amazing Windwaker run!Thank you all for everything that you do, and let's hope that we together one day can say that cancer was beat because of gaming :)
Pun Alert. Long time watcher, first time donator. Donating so we can help find the missing "Link" for curing cancer.
Donating for a good cause and that LoZ diamond painting! Shoutouts to all the staff and crew for all their hard work! Oh also, hi Jersh!
How do you estimate a randomizer????
HONK!!!!
This donation is a shout out to dancing fingers in the front row. Keep rocking out and keep the AGDQ breaks entertaining.
Glad we're getting together again to fight cancer. Shoutouts to the 502 Krew.
I spend two halves of every year waiting for the next GDQ event. I'm super stoked to watch one of my favorite childhood games, Super Mario 64 get all mixed up and destroyed tonight! Let's make it to 2 million and WAY BEYOND!
Donating on behalf of my husband who is sitting here next to me watching AGDQ unaware that I’m donating. Thanks to everyone behind the scenes for making this event possible!
Thanks to everyone involved in this wonderful event! Looking forward to the Control run and that awesome Ashtray Maze!
This is the last donation that I can make, but it puts me more than I have ever donated. My dad is beating cancer, but I want to help others so they never have to. Put this toward the One Mind hard mode.
Just a casual gamer here, consistently blown away by all of the incredible talent on display at AGDQ. Thanks for all that the incredible community does for such a great cause.
Love watching AGDQ and couldn’t go to a better charity
This I gotta see
Fantastic AGDQ as always! I lost my grandmother to pancreatic cancer, so this event means more than usual for me this year. Also, shout-out to Linkus7 for his awesome playthrough on WindWaker.
Let's get at least this incentive met guys!
I lost my dad to lung cancer exactly 1 year as I lost my mom to something similar. I dearly hope that Games Done Quick helps other people survive, and helps prevent cancer to begin with.
I gotta see that hard mode one mind run! Let's go!
Son, All of the Duluth Smash Crew has your back.Love,Simply's Landlord

Love SM64 and figured a great time to donate. RIP Neal Peart
Thank you again to all the runners, staff, donors, and everyone else for another honking good time for a honking good cause. Let's toss cancer into the lake.
Getting to see One Mind Hard Mode would be pretty....nice.
Rooting for my boi 360Chrism, 50$ more if he explains what a spicy jesus is. Let's go Link's awakening!
Always incredible to watch amazing people raise money for an amazing cause. As someone who has always been a fan of music it is sad to hear of Neil Peart's passing, so in remembrance here is a split donation for his name to be the character name in Dracula X and to here more during the Clone Hero showcase.
Loving games, but hating cancer. Mash those buttons to smash those diseases!
All of my birthday money, good luck with all of the runs
Attn: Evan Kinney:Fortnite sucks
GDQ is my favorite time of the year I appreciate everything you guys are doing for the prevention of cancer!
This is for my daughter Charlotte who loves legend of Zelda. Thank you everyone for all that you do to make this happen so that she can enjoy it. Let's get that legend of Zelda link's awakening game unlocked so she can have more legend of Zelda to enjoy!
Shout out to my favorite streamer/runner GrandPooBear, will be at my cousin's funeral tomorrow and won't be able to watch it. Go get them Poo and let's kick Cancer to the... Honk?! Love watching AGDQ every year and love being in a position to help donate this year, especially since my Grandfather and Aunt both passed from Cancer. Good luck to all the speed runners out there for the rest of GDQ and thanks again to the great staff that help put this event on every year!
I'm another one of those pesky "long time watcher, first time donator"s. Unfortunately, I've been unable to see much of the stream live, but now is the perfect time to donate during my favorite game of all time, Super Mario 64. A big shoutout to the entirety of the SM64 community for breathing new life into this amazing game. I'm so glad to finally have the funds to support this incredible charity event. The impact that Games Done Quick has made over the years and will continue to make is surely ground breaking. Here's to a new decade of saving lives and killing cancer!
My internet went down for two hours halfway through Super Mario Bro’s. 3, so I couldn’t donate for Pokémon Blue. Glad we still made it.
I have watched for so long and I can finally donate! For my first time I just want to think all of you guys for putting all this together! <3 I lost my cousin to cancer and found my first GDQ stream that year. Goes towards links awakening!
I love GDQ and I love Super Mario 64. Here's 64 dollars to a great cause. Congrats to all the runners, organisers, donors and everyone involved in this great cause. Let's-a go!
I've been a long time watcher but haven't been able to donate in a long time. Lets get that One Mind Hard Mode going!
Getting hyped for the Dank Souls Run! My husband died in this game all the time. It's exciting to donate to PCF and to help fund scientific research. Good luck to all the runners left tonight! PCF!!!
Let's hit that one mind hard mode incentive
Love watching everyone completely destroy the intended way of playing these games! Super Mario 64 Runs always blow my mind! Great event! Great Cause! HYYYYYPPPPPEEEEEE!!!!!!!
I started watching speedruns during my divorce and this community's commitment to being open, accepting, and generous has truly inspired me. This donation goes out to my mom who is a breast cancer survivor. Thanks to all the runners, staff, and volunteers. You're all HONK!
My mom is going through chemo right now, and I'm hoping I can get a Mama-honk for her fast recovery!
Bonjour from France ! GDQ is one of my favorite event even though it's messing with my sleep schedule. Wanted to donate during one of my favorite game of all time, Super Mario 64 !Let's kick cancer !
First time watching but I love what you guys are doing, I lost my uncle from cancer that didn’t get detected until it was too late, this is for him <3 lots of love from Canada
Here's to my beautiful wife, Janet, the runners, and the awesome cause. Keep saving frames, glitching through walls, and save the animals!
The Dyna-Mite video in Control is one of the best moments from one of the best games of last year. We gotta see it on stream.
Neil Peart was a legend and cancer is insidious, I've had enough of it, let's blast it to bits.
Why doesn't Mario like tight spaces? Because there's not mushroom.
Here's to all the runners! Good luck not dying!
Tnemmoc on
Honk!
In memory of Neil Peart, one of the greatest drummers and lyricists in rock history, who recently lost his battle with cancer. His family has asked that people wishing to express their condolences donate to cancer charities of their choice. It feels appropriate that GDQ is going on right now. Thanks to all the runners and organisers. I’ve really enjoyed the Wind Waker run, the Zelda 1/2/3 run the other night, and am looking forward to seeing the Mario 64 randomizer, SMW One Mind, and especially Andy’s Crowd Control run on Sunday. Good luck to the runners!
Link... Link... open your eyes... wake up!
Hi, Games Done Quick. Please help the Prevent Cancer Foundation to save my grandmother from metastatic breast cancer.—David P, 9 years old
We love you Dance Dad!
Let the Hjonkening begin. Rise up brothers and sisters! Do not allow such fowl play, fight cancer!
Nice job to all runners and the hosts. had to donate when i new my family was watching we love what you all do.
Good Luck and there is always a way.
Chrism is a dancer. chrisGrin
One mind hard mode let's go!
Mario is a pretty cool guy. He doesn't afraid of anything.
GDQ brings so much joy to my family ever year! Keep up the great work.
My humans has been watching all week and I have been trying my best to not attack the bouncing characters on the screen (they are going too fast to catch anyways). Can I get a HONK for being such a good kitty?
Hey guys. I have watched GDQ for a couple of year now, but this is the first time I'm able to donate. And hopefully next year we will se move runners from my home country, Brazil.
Let's see some One Mind!
We were all cancer till we were 3 months premature. Please donate.
TASBot?! Zelda?! Mario randomizer AND Mario World?! Dark Souls?! Have to donate for this absolutely stacked Friday night (in memory of Neil Peart of Rush)
My girlfriend and I love the Legend of Zelda so we had to donate for the BONUS GAME 6: The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening (2019) Any% incentive. Come on everyone lets wake up and get that... Wind Fish?
Donating in honor of my wife who lost her uncle to cancer this week, and all of our family members
Finally have the money to give more than 20 bucks this year! So happy to donate to such a great cause.
Only 2nd time seeing a Randomizer, but stayed awake for that at 4:15 AM in germany. Great event (as always)
I’ve been watching and donating to GDQ since the beginning, and I’m always just wowed. My mom passed away 4 years ago, and as a lifelong nurse she would’ve wanted me to donate. This is for you, Mom! Everything goes to the one mind hard mode!
Donating to support Chrism. You're one of my favorite speedrunners, and these Mario Randomizer runs are always amazing. Good luck!
Almost $1.5M :)
D’après une étude américaine, faire un don avant de se coucher permet de mieux dormir ! Enfin, j'ai pas de source, mais ça coûte pas grand chose d'essayer ;-)#MarioLight
I've watched every GDQ since SGDQ 2013 and love discovering new games and runners. Thanks, GDQ staff and runners to another amazing event to start off the year!
We gotta see Super Mario World:OneMind!
I had to make my first donation when my best friend in the entire world was running at AGDQ. Ever since you first started streaming, I knew that you'd become one of the best DS1 runners. Thank you for getting me into the soulsborne series and for being such a great friend. I'm so proud of you Regole! Happy Birthday!!
We simply must upgrade the SMW OneMind run to hard mode!
It’s been a Battlefield of an event so far. Let’s Thwomp cancer and have a Jolly good time with these Cool speed runs. Some runs are Haunting, some are Hazy, some even Lethal, but don’t Shift your weight, this is a Dire situation. In our Land, Wet or Dry, Tiny or Huge, Tall or Short, don’t let the time Tick Tock away. Just let it Ride!
Do this for my mom who died a year ago from cancer, and also for the amazing runs lets make cancer gone!

Actually learned about Peart's death today from an AGDQ donation and was stunned. Most amazing drummer I've ever heard. So saddened by the news. Here is my donation in honor of an amazing musician and person. RIP Peart.
Once again, I have to donate for GDQ and the amazing things they do. Always have to give thanks to my friend Ellie for getting me introduced to GDQ. We tend to spend most GDQs talking about the runs and excitedly watching the tracker go higher and higher. Break records of all kinds this year!
Long time watcher, first time donater! Greetings from the Kentucky Smash Community! Always get excited to see Puncay DESTROY Super Mario 64. We are all rooting for you and may the RNG gods be on your side!
Hi! Fight cancer! Run speeds! Let’s honk!
Rest In Peace Neil Peart
First time donator! Im doing my part :) Love this event <3
For Neil Peart my favorite drummer of all time who passed away from brain cancer this week. Give to this castlevania incentive.
Every GDQ feels like vacation for me. Without any work related stress or other daily problems. Just pure enjoyment and gaming. Specially Mario 64 Races are my all time favorites. Regards from germany
Hello from New Zealand! As a nurse that see a lot of cancers destroying lives daily, and it's absolutely heartbreaking, I couldn't help but jump at the opportunity to contribute. Totally love the cause (and all past causes) and I've enjoyed watching all runners destroying all my childhood games in GDQ for the last 4-5 years!! Donation goes to announcer's choice.
Second ever GDQ took the whole week off, I cannot thank you enough Ophie and Z for introducing us to this incredible event! This goes to Legend of Zelda Links Awakening, let's get that last bonus game!
Shout out to the best streaming tech crew in the business. Keep up the Awesome work!
Donating in memory of Grandpa Phil who passed away 10 years ago to pancreatic cancer. Putting this toward the Super Mario World One Mind Hard Mode incentive! Shoutout to the Dapper! HONK!
Link’s Awakening on the Game Boy was my very first game, and it was given to me by my awesome mom who just beat cancer. Donating for her, and so we can see that new Link’s Awakening run. HONK.

This was the run I was most interested in and managed to tune in at the right time at random. So happy to be able to donate to such a good cause. My mom recently went into remission. Keep doing what you’re doing, and thank you for everything you do! (Go Simply!)
No comment
Ever since I found out about Games Done Quick I have always looked forward to a fantastic week of incredible people be so nice and friendly while destroying games in the best way possible. Shout out to everybody keeping things flowing right and for the crowd for being so supportive.
Lost dad to cancer last year. Just want to give my thanks to everyone involved for supporting such a good cause <3
Waaaaaaaaaaa. Wahoo. Yah yah. Hoo. Here we gooo!
My fiancé introduced me to AGDQ several years ago and we have watched every year since. This is a great cause and you are all awesome for making this event possible!
My wife and I have watched GDQs for a number of years - we always enjoy the runs and donate when we’re able. This year we’re sad to donate in memory of arguably the greatest drummer of all time and a member of our favorite band. Rest in power Neil Peart and thank you to everyone involved with GDQ for your time, talent and generosity.
Hey there! TTP here, SM64 TASer! Just wanted to wish all the runners luck for the random, and hope they can showcase not only some good improvised tech, but also get some crazy spawns!Heck cancer!
Insert comment of honking proportions
Id love to talk about this race, but first we have to talk about parallel universes! In it for that Links Awakening Run.Take it easy everyone.
Letsa go to the goal of One Mind Hard Mode!
LETSA GOOOOO
One of the best albums ever, rest in peace Neil
Nothing relevant. Just good luck to all the runners. Thanks to GDQ for putting on these amazing events. And thank you to all of the volunteers and donors for your generosity of time and money. Be breathtaking.
Five on Puncayshun to win...wait, is this the betting booth? Simply, Puncayshun, 360Chrism, I fell in love with speedrunning thanks to your races, thank you and let’s see a good clean fight!
Hello! I've watched GDQ's VODs for years and have always wanted to donate. I decided to put my money where my mouth is and "MMMFFPH!"In all seriousness, I am a broke college student who came home for the holidays to hear that my mom was diagnosed with breast cancer. It hit me so hard because of some cruel irony. I'm transgender and I am looking into getting my breasts removed. She doesn't have a choice. She had her double mastectomy today, and is looking at a year of chemo. I figured now was a better time than any to donate. Nobody deserves to suffer from such a horrible disease.Thank you to everyone for making Awesome Games Done Quick live up to its name!
Had to donate during Super Mario 64, it's one of my husband's favorite games. GDQ really means a lot to us, my sister just had to go back on chemo and we love and appreciate all the good work you're doing. Let's beat cancer once and for all! HONK!!!!
This donation is in the memory of the late Rush drummer Neil Peart who lost his fight with brain cancer earlier today. Glad to donate to such a great cause in his honor. good luck to the runners, donation goes to announcer's choice.
Heck yeah brother. Been looking forward to this all week. Good luck to the runners.
Here's a little bit to go to helping those with their current battles and to hopefully wiping out cancer. Stay strong!
One of my favorite games growing up, let's a go.( if read I will donate $50 more)
I love GDQ not just because it supports an amazing cause but also because watching it with my little brothers is something I've been able to turn into a tradition. Super Mario 64 is one of my favorite games ever, and I can't help but donate every time it's on. Here's to GDQ, my brothers, and of cou- HONK!
This donation is for Neil Peart and all Rush fans.

Good Evening, GDQ! Mad Hype for all of the incredible runners in this event. Been a watcher since 2014, and a huge fan ever since. Shoutouts to my buddy Max, and to all of the incredible runners and crew who've made these events possible. Can we get some HYPE for them? Here's to another decade of Speed-running goodness.

Hey authorblues, I love watching when you're on the mic in GDQ events, ever since I saw your hilarious commentary of saintmillion's run of Episode I:The Phantom Menace. Put this donation to the One Mind run because we HAVE to see that, y'all!
I think its time we kick cancers butt!
It's awesome to see runners with such a depth of knowledge of a game that they can adapt on the fly with a randomizer. Good luck to the runners, and try not to honk - I mean, bonk.
Hey, AGDQ, I've always enjoyed watching this event with my best buddy, and this time is no different!
My dad was diagnosed with cancer two years ago. Great to see you all doing this for such a worthy cause. Shoutouts to Dooter Pooter.
Happy 2020 AGDQ! Really been loving the hype for Super Mario 64 in recent months. Good luck to the runners and shout outs to TonesBalones and Tboy who may or may not be attending right now. And if possible, can we get a “Wahoo!” From the audience?
Love watching GDQ, cheers to all those who donate their time to make this event happen. Much love!
Thank you GDQ for all that you do. I lost my Grandma and 2 Aunts to cancer. But, my cousin Ryan survived thanks to extremely important cancer research. Can you please please please read this out so we can start a $10 train towards One Mind Hard Mode? This way we can hear more survivor stories.
I'm always a fan of GDQ season! I've been loving these alternate game modes in speedrunning, like this SM64 randomizer. What a fun and challenging spin on a classic game!
HONK HONK
So long kinga Bowser!
Pack up all those phantomsShoulder that invisible loadKeep on riding north and westHaunting that wilderness roadLike a ghost riderRest in peace, Neil Peart.
Of course I'll donate for Super Mario World (and preventing cancer). This game was a huge part of my childhood. Yoshi was a game changer, along with so many other fun additions like the feather and Star World. Also, shout out to my love AdderAfterall!
I always make time for Games Done Quick, even if pesky things like work try to get in the way! Good luck to all the runners, and this donation goes to the announcer’s choice.
ONE. MIND. HARD. MOOOODE. *insert mushroom emoji here*
My wife yelled, “Donate, donate now!” Happy wife equals happy life.

Shoutout to everyone running SM64 Rando! I hope that one day, I'll be as good at anything as these runners are at Super Mario 64. Donation goes to the One Mind run because after this, I'm hoping to feel a little bit better about myself.
ExactLee
Donating for honk mode!
Wahoo!!
<3
Thanks for a great AGDQ and for destroying all my favorite games before my eyes. I especially loved the Fire Emblem run, which left me in tears. I've played it for an embarrassing amount of time and witnessed Claris bend the rules to her will while beating it in under 2 hours. My spirit has been broken and I'm not sure I'll ever be able to pick it up again. As the once great and inspiring hero of the Black Eagles frequently said, "I am Ferdinand von Aegir!"
I love SuperMario64, and I was first introduced to the randomizer watching Arthur Blues channel! I love the commentary, and the awesome runners. Here's to getting that One Mind run incentive.
$1 for every star collected tonight; amazing job by everyone this week. Don't ever stop running, don't ever stop donating!
Super mario 64 was the game that got me into the speedrunning community and I don’t know where I’d be without it. I’m cheering on Simply and everyone from the crowd! Love you all
Heya gdq, first time donating, long overdue. Love what you folks are doing here for such a noble cause, keep up the great work.
I want to see the SMW One Mind run in hard mode, so let's get a donation train going!
I love how much GDQ diversifies its game and category selections every time. I have only caught a few hours of this event each day but I have to say it has been the most entertaining GDQ to date for me. All of the staff, runners, and donors should be very proud of what they are doing. Good luck to the runners and keep up the great work!
For Patrick Kidder Jr., aka "BigIrishJuggalo." You are surrounded by love and good wishes. "Frick Cancer in the bum!"
Been watching for several years and I enjoy every single GDQ marathon. Been supporting chrism for years and would like to put the money to his choice. Good luck to all the runners.
WAAAAAAAAAAAA!
This one's for Neil Peart.
This is the exact run I've been waiting for! Good luck to all the runners, but especially puncayshun! HONK!
Making a donation in honor of my mother and grandmother, who passed of ovarian cancer, and my father, in remission from kidney cancer now. Given my family history, I feel I and future generations will directly benefit from the research we are funding now. Bless the runners, the staff, and everyone at GDQ. Hooooooooooonk!
What are you kids up to? Playing that Super Mary O game again?
Hello! GDQ is always such a feel-good event, and it makes me really happy to see so many people gathering for video games and, of course, fighting cancer. Keep up the good work! :D
$21.12 in honor of Neil Peart, who passed away today from brain cancer.
Marios
In honor of Neil Peart, Rest In Peace brother
I love the Super Mario 64 randomizer, it's fascinating to see the thought processes involved in deciding where to go. Also happy birthday Bird!
we need to get that one mind incentive! I want to see the chaos of that run!!
First runner to find Bowser 3 gets to pick donation insentive. Shout out to bella who is also watching
What letters is Mario most afraid of? N, M, E
First time watching GDQ and I’m hooked. Thank you for gaming for such an amazing cause!
Thank you everyone for all you guys are doing
Finally i can donate to my favorite event please keep the good work and good luck to al the runners.
Just had to donate towards SMW One Mind hard mode. Good luck to all the runners!
Auth is doing such a great job on the mic right now, so I feel bad about making One Mind even more difficult for him... but I don’t feel quite as bad about giving more of a challenge to LackAttack. Let’s make this goal!
I love seeing the progressively weirder game modes runners come up with to showcase at these events each year. Looking forward to watching a blindfolded 5 controllers, 3 players One Mind Breath of the Wild Randomizer Any% at AGDQ 2024. Donation goes to One Mind Hard mode!
Why don't they let Toad sit on the couch with them? Because he takes up too 'mushroom' (much room)
It's-a from me, Marrrrio!
The Super Mario 64 randomizer run is the one I’ve been looking forward to all week—and it definitely is living up to the hype. Thanks to Chrism, Simply, and Puncayshun for such a fun race!
Having a great time watching the SM64 Randomizer race with my 6 year old son. This donation is going toward the Link’s Awakening incentive because it’s one of our favorite games to play together. Thanks to all the GDQ staff and runners for putting on an amazing event!
Let's get that Mario World hard mode!
Hey All, Yetee Here! I'm simply having a wonderful time watching this run! I can't imagine the mental gymnastics involved in trying to keep track of all the randomized routes for a run like this. Major props to all the racers, let's give them a big round of applause!
LETSA GO!!!...beat cancer
Squawk? no wait! HONK HONK!
I love you all
$5 TRAIN CHOO CHOO!
Only about 5k for One Mind Hard Mode to go, we can do this!

Dernier don, plus jamais ça ! (jusqu'à la sgdq) #Tempetedesang
Can anyone tell me why Mario is advertising Yahoo every time he long-jumps?
For Neil Peart, who sadly lost his battle with brain cancer on Tuesday.
Such a good race! I have been watching GDQs since 2012 and have loved every year! Putting this donation to the Bonus Honk! and Link's Awakening
My last donation for this GDQ, in honor of Neil Peart.
Let’s a go!
Hello authorblues (lowercase a!) Your pal Screevo here. Good luck to you and Lack on the OneMind run, I’m sure you have it all under control. Wait, no you don’t. Yes you do. No you don’t. Now you do. I’m so confused! Oh well, good luck anyway! Have fun, donating for hard mode.
Can we get an anarchy block next year? Fill it with Mario 64 Randomizer, Super Mario World One Mind, Link to the Past Crowd Control, then finish it off with Untitled Goose Game.
SM64 Randomizer's always a treat. As cool as hard mode on One Mind sounds, I wanna hear Through the Fire and Flames.
Simply, keep it going you got this my man, love this game, even goofy categories like this
WAHOO!!!!!
One Mind Hard Mode... Mario will need a way to bail himself out after running off a cliff.
Me and my girlfriend bet 5 bucks on who would win the race.. we both picked wrong. Dont bet against Chris. We lose but charity wins!
My girlfriend and I made a bet where the loser had to donate, and we both lost. Double the money for charity!
Thanks y'all, I'm gonna be hearing Mario sounds in my sleep now. Donating towards One Mind Hard Mode!!! YAHOOOO!!
Kill the cancer, save the frames.Shoutouts to Simpleflips
My friends and I all made bets and we all lost. So long Bowser!
Thank you GDQ, Runners, Announcers, everyone that took the time and effort for the planning, preparation, and execution of this amazing event. To those of you that put on the show as well as the unsung heros behind the scenes of each year, thank you.
GG Chris!! <3
Chris wins!

Why would you quit? cancer doesn't quit
I'm still alive!
This donation is in honor of my sister's pup Lio who sadly passed yesterday. He was a good boy who lived a wonderful full life. You will be missed, friend.

So Close! Let's finish this goal.
What an amazing randomizer run! Congrats to all the runners. This will be my last donation for the event, so here's one last good luck to the rest of the runners, one last huge thank you to the staff, and let everyone beware the Agent of Chaos known as: The Goose.
ONE MIND HONK MODE
After 64 days, one of my best friends came home today from the hospital. He's been undergoing intensive treatments for leukemia. Thanks to early detection, he has great chances for a full recovery. Thanks to PCF for their work and all the amazing work of the GDQ staff and runners!
Let's go all in for the One-Mind run. We can do it!
One mind hard mode!
Choo-Choo
Very cool to see SM64 Rando at a GDQ! Here's one dollar for every star we've collected along the way.Fun fact: did you know that Terra is the only member of the Wayfinder trio who hasn't been featured in a GDQ Birth By Sleep run? Let's fix that and make for another "that's never happened before" moment!
I need that hard mode.
I can't wait for a run of the amazing remake of my favorite Zelda game. Let's get that incentive met everyone!
Amazing games as always, let’s hit that One Mind hard mode!
Here's to 10 more years of GDQ. Gee, that bonfire replica would go great with my Solaire Cosplay, that is if I don't go hollow. Praise the Sun!
aimai mind
My fiance, Ben, and I have been watching all week! We love AGDQ. Cancer is a boss fight that one day all of us will win against. Thanks for being amazing you guys.
(read during Dark Souls run please)I beat regole at puyo puyo tetris on new years eve, it was awesome, all hail panda queen of games
I don't usually like commenting about prizes, and I've never played Dark Souls... But that bonfire prize is way too cool to pass up a shot at!
Ooooorb! HONK! Hoooooy! Waaaaa!
Are we really going to let Lack and Authorblues have it easy? Let's get this incentive done!
One mind honk mode
48 6f 6e 6b 21How about in Hex.
Really looking forward to this One Mind run to cap off a night of great runs and races.
Gymnast86's earlier run of Skyward Sword reignited my love for that game. Skyward Sword was my first Zelda game, and while I feel there are "better" games in the series, Skyward Sword is the one closest to my heart. Currently trying to replay it on Hero Mode. Wish me luck.
So many amazing games and runners this week, and so many more to come. Can you tell my cousin in the audience: Sleep is overrated, get hyped for Dark Souls!

Excellent Super Mario 64 race. It was legit exhilarating. Thanks to this event for raising money to prevent cancer so we can save more lives.
woop
This is better than x-mas, the super bowl, the world series and world war 2 combined. Thanks to all runners for the event of the year!
This month marks the 3rd year I lost my great grandmother to pancreatic cancer. She had already had a different type of cancer before I was born and was able to beat it, but cancer came back to take her from our lives. Let's kick cancer's butt everyone!
Dark souls deserves to be Dank.
Loved the Mario64 runs! Good luck to the remaining players. I'll be watching and enjoying some Glass Vodka. Game on!
Very excited for this Super Mario World run! Good luck to the runners!

Great job on the runs so far. Shout out How To Fly!
Do the hard mode... oops too slow. How about a early start on the Bonus 6 incentive?
Great to see the show again. Looking forward to seeing some great runs. Keep up the good work.
AGDQ is always a great way to start off the year. A great event for a great cause. I had to donate during Lackattack's run. It's dangerous to go alo.......wait a minute this isn't Zelda?! Good luck! Oh yeah....HONK!
Praise the Sun
Can't wait for Trauma Center late tonight and all the great surgery! But prevention and early detection are more important now than ever!
Just boarded the SMW hype train! Anyone care to join? Let's-a-go! HYPE!
well this was gonna go to one mind but it got met as i submitted so lets go towards untitled goose game.
Long time watcher, first time attendee. The atmosphere here is absolutely hype and I am so glad I was able to experience it first hand. Congrats on 10 years, and here's to another decade of going fast.
I'm not looking back, but I want to look around me now. See more of the people and the places that surround me now. Time stands still.
(read this when it's time...you'll know when)BETRAYAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Donation goes to runner's choice(s).
Greetings from the AGDQ practice room! I had the pleasure of meeting both LackAttack and authorblues, they are a joy to talk to. We are all of one mind that cancer needs to disappear, so take my money and apply it to runner's choice.
Love watching GDQ every time it comes around and always have to donate to these amazing charities! Thanks to everyone in front of and behind the camera that make this whole event possible!
From Japanese Restream
I received my copy of Super Mario World at my Grandmas house. We lost her to cancer last year. Thank you so much for having Mario World on stream.
Hello everyone, I have been watching the past few years and I am finally able to donate to this amazing cause! Lets all work together to end cancer! HONK!
Here’s to a world without cancer. Thank you all for another great year of GDQ.
Thank you to everyone who helps to put on this event. Good luck to all the remaining runners and let's kick cancer's butt!
Always enjoy watching GDQ all week long. Honk!
Love all the GDQ events. Glad I could finally donate to help beat cancer. Lets get that Untitled Goose Game Run. HONK!
Amazing event as always. Lets get these Incentives!
Greetings from Norway! As an engineer i started working with cancer research this summer, and seeing the drive and positivity in this event I'm convinced that we will be able to kick cancer in the butt and honk it away for good!
Greetings from the audience. It's a real privilege to see LackAttack, who got me hooked on speed running, live in action and for such a good cause.
For our Kevin who's fighting cancer.
Hey GDQ! Been watching since 2013 and it has been amazing to see how much this event has grown! Hoping to attend in person for the first time for summer games done quick this year. In the mean time keep up the amazing work and let’s hit that $3 million!!!!
Donating in honor of Neil Peart. The $21.12 donation caravan thunders onward!
I've been watching GDQ for 3 years now, but I'm not the best at puns that everyone loves, so I wanted to offer my favorite joke to Covert Muffin and everyone.There are two muffins in an oven. One says to the other,"Is it just me, or is it getting hot in here?"The second muffin says"AAAAAAHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!! TALKING MUFFIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Love you GDQ
Honk? Honk! Honk honk.
My father was recently diagnosed with two type four cancers, and I'd like to someday be at a place where no one has to feel that.

Lost some family years ago and really love watching agdq every year. This year is absolutely killing it! HONK!
I have watched GDQ events for years now and it always warms my heart seeing so many people come together to make the world a better place. Thanks to everyone who makes GDQ happen, the runners, audience, and everyone who watches.
It’s time to end cancer once and for all.
Been Watching GDQ for a few years now, and have loved every second of it. Thanks, organization team, runnings, and all the cute viewers out there! <3
I'M PICKLE RICKKKKKKK
Watching all these runners destroy all these great games makes me want to get into speed running but I can never choose one to learn. Thank you runners for letting me live vicariously through you.
UK here, I love GDQ. I currently look after my mother who has cancer. Using gaming to kill cancer!
This has been an incredible AGDQ and it ain’t done yet. This donation is in honor of my dad who passed away to cancer almost 4 years ago. Together, we can make sure no one else has to go through that battle.
Keep on keeping on
This one goes out to Neil. Dark Souls is my favorite series and am super hyped for the run. Also Mario World too.
RIP Neil Peart
cancer bad
so glad we got One Mind Hard Mode! glhf runners!!
e#smwcrew
I'm ready for the Super Mario World run! HYPE!!
💝
Just started a 12 hour shift at work. Can't wait to see all these awesome runs.
👍
My dad recently was diagnosed with cancer, and it is heartwarming to see the community come together for a good cause. Good luck to Lack and authorblues.
HONK!!!!
Awesome GDQ this week. 7th year of watching. Thanks for the amazing work and sleep deprivation.
Boulot terminé, enfin le weekend ! Je peux faire mon premier don !Merci au FrenchRestream et aux commentateurs pour ambiancer mes nuits au boulot et nous permettre de suivre l'AGDQ en sachant ce qu'il ce passe à l'écran !Bizz ! #LonaLink
You guys are doing great work, my mother went through quite an ordeal with her ovarian cancer. I know it could have been much worse if it wasn't for all the research that's been done.
We are past 40k for Link's Awakening! Keep those donations rolling in.
So apparently owning 6 copies of Bubsy 3D is the key to enlightenment and honing your telepathy. Loving the run, auth!
I made sure to take some overtime so I could be sure to donate to this great cause. I lost my hero, my grandpa who used to let me watch him slay demons and save princesses in video game to cancer, thank you for this fantastic event.
Shout out to all the talented runners and supporting staff at agdq!! Thanks for all the hard work. This donation is for my aunt Janet
Thank you to GDQ staff, the commentators, and especially the runners for putting on the most bonkers GDQ yet. Hey, by the way, what game should I learn to run? :thinking:
Was commentating a Smash Bros tournament at Uptime Esports in Mass when I told the crowd to watch GDQ next week. Shout out to the 12 year old who came up and told me it was this week to correct my error. Sorry for the late Dono!
SMW was the first game I owned. Rush was one of the first bands I loved. Donating in memory of Neil Peart.
From one Clemson Tiger to the two running Super Mario World One Mind.....Go Tigers! Beat LSU!
Can't wait to see one of my favorite games, Dark Souls run soon. Thanks for everything you all do, and keep up the good work.
Best of luck, auth and Lack! Firm belief!
Good luck to the runners in the Super Mario World game. :)
It's Friday Night... we could be anywhere, but we are here... show your GDQ spirit and get us to $2.0M... HONK!!! HYPE!! Aaawwwssooooomme :) I also challenge healthcare workers and parental units that would like to see speed runs of Donkey Kong, and Frogger. Because I can't stop staring at my toes when my kids try to get me to play Halo or any other FPS game.
I’ve been watching GDQs for a few years now, but have never donated. But over the last year I’ve lost both my Uncle and Mother to cancer. I’m thrilled to be able to support GDQ and help prevent cancer. ... And maybe win a cool custom PC. 😬
Here is to Gram Gram's memory from passing away from cancer. Thank you for all you do.
First time watching the GDQ fundraiser, love what you guys are doing! Keep up the great work!!
Hi crowd of people!
Sending in this donation in honor of my sister Kristina, who is currently fighting Thyroid Cancer. OneMind HYPE!!!
Thank you for such a solid way to raise money for a noble cause. My wife's grandmother passed away from cancer, and hopefully with this research, we will lose less people to this terrible illness. Love you guys.
I will donate another 75 dollars, if the crowd yells "HYPE", but says it like a seal saying "ARF-ARF-ARF"...."HYP,HYP,HYP,HYP!"
Next year Twitch controls Luigi?
Two people, one mind, total insanity. Let's beat cancer!
CLAMPS!
This is the best GDQ run of all time I'm so happyShout out to the trauma center run later tonight!
This is for all cancer patients out there my grandma included. Much love to all!
THOUSANDS OF YEARS AGO...My friend said Hey come check this out and he showed me super Mario world. I was introduced a world of sound and color and joy. Hereis $5 towardsevery exit and every mind at GDQ2020 during the game that changed my life.Heck the animals, heck cancer, there is only hype.
I will donate 10$ per death. Also HONK
authGoodGameLove you, friend!
Thanks for the awesome marathon and this awesome run!
I've been watching AGDQ for 10 years now, and I have already donated a lot this year, but I had to donate again to say this is easily my favorite run in the history of this event. Thank you LackAttack and AuthorBlues!
So many great runs tonight that I can't seem to pull myself away from the stream. Congrats to all the runners on another fantastic event.
hahah...hAH
We've had a lot of hype, a lot of orbs, and a whole lot of honks at GDQ this year, but I have been saddened by a distinct lack of Waaaaahhhhs. In honor of this SMW One Mind run, can the audience give their best Waluigi Wahhhhh? Much love to the hardworking runners, volunteers, and staff.
Have to donate again for these amazing runners and this fabulous event. My mother survived a cancer scare a few years ago, so I know how this disease affects people and those around them. Let's help Link to wake up from his Dream and also have Super Mario Maker be Super Secretly Run. Thanks to everyone involved for a wonderful week full of laughter, excitement and HONKS.
LUI-RIO, I CHOOSE YOU!!
Love watching GDQ with my sons Connor and Jonathan each year, and we are happy to help kick cancer's butt.
Wasn't sure to expect with this run but it is incredible :D Having so much fun watching. And of course, Luigi is best, no matter what the stars say <3
Socom 2 still better than Cod
PLEASE read this one!!!!!!........ shoutout to the guy who keeps yelling I love you man
This is a glorious train wreck and I love it. Here’s to one of my favorite runners, lackablues!
Another $25 dollars if one of the players intentionally causes another death.
My mother lost the battle against cancer earlier this year. Here's to a future where no one will have to face that battle, and prevention is key!Friendly reminder to submit your receipts to your employer, as they typically match your donations and sometimes more! Good luck to all the runners!
No comment
Since I won't be able to catch the Dark Souls run tonight, I figured I'd donate during this beautiful chaotic mess. Sending love to AuthorBlues, because I think he needs it right now.
I lost my mother last May after a 12 year fight with non small cell lung cancer, she never smoked a day in her life. Having seen the advances in Cancer medication over those years, prevention is still much better than any other method of dealing with this disease. So, here are all of the Tips and incentives i earned this week working for Uber. I never want anyone to deal with Cancer ever again.
Switching between Mario then Luigi then Mario.. are these the parallel universes they warned us about? If both players press A but there's only one jump, is it half an A-press?!?! Shoutout to Simpleflips!?!?
Excited to be watching this OneMind run with my wife, the runners argue like a married couple and it’s great to watch. Shut up and take my money!
I'm so glad my previous donation helped make this hard-mode run as entertaining (hilarious) as it is! Co-op runs are the best!
These two are just like an old Mario-ed couple!You two can do it! HYPE!
I can't wait to see if auth and LackAttack are drift compatible......so far my expectations are very low.
PIVOT!
What a run! Hilarious premise, hilarious runners, this is a blast to watch!Greetings from Germany, GDQ HYYYYPE!
Good luck to my favorite speedrunner Lackattack and the funniest speedrunner Authorblues.
PIVOT PIVOT PIVOTSeriously though, this is absurd and I love it.
For Neil Peart
If Keizaron is the village idiot than give me more of that idiot! Let's go!
Hello AGDQ! Long time viewer, first time donor. I lost my college professor to pancreatic cancer a few years ago. He was an important influence in my life and I miss him dearly. Thank you so much for all your efforts in runni this event for the past couple of years and making the fight against cancer one to remember!
Had to donate for the chaotic evil trolling, thanks for the laughs guys!
Did you know "Super Mario World: One Mind" is an anagram for "now a sidelined prom rumor"? The more you know. The runner who gets credit for defeating Bowser chooses the incentive.
donating for a great run for a great causeappreciate the cheeky looks up at the falling hazardgood luck to you both and good luck to us all
I dedicate this second donation to my great grandmother. She shaped my life so much in ways she never imagined. She was diagnosed with cancer before but wasn't so lucky the second time around. Thanks GDQ staff, the runners, and chat for all your hard work!
If AUTHORBLUES and LACKATTACK24 are not already a couple, they need to be. Love the banter! Get them a sitcom!
When's Super Metroid One mind? Lovin' the run.
mario! luigi! mario! luigi! who can keep track of this chaos?! this super mario world run is fantastic!
why would Toad want to sit on the couch? He’s got his own special Toad-stool!
This One Mind SMW run is incredible. Easily one of the most entertaining runs of this year!
Great cause here, happy to contribute every year Another 10 coming if we can kill yoshi a few more times.
This Super Mario World run is so amazing I wanna trying this with my boyfriend to show pure torture! wuuf you sweetie! HONK!
Is anybody else getting flashbacks to that episode of Evangelion where Shinji and Asuka have to defeat the angel in tandem?I'm picturing a training montage where Blues and Lack are both listening to Shinji's cassette player.
Watching these two try to beat Super Mario World together is like witnessing the Left and Right halves of the brain try to communicate and I've never laughed harder. keep up the great work
This run reminds me of when I used to play Super Mario World with my older brother as a kid, except my controller wasn't plugged in when I tried to kill him repeatedly.
Had to donate for my boy Lack. Most entertained I've been thus far! LackGeno LackGeno LackGeno. Donation to his and Auth's choice.
Thank you for doing this!
Another great AGDQ. Loved every single run i've seen so far, and i'm absolutely loving this SMWorld run.PS: Hey, CovertMuffin. Your personality inspires me, love you man :) Also, Take a bath :D
A one mind coop run? Who had this idea? This is genius!Let's get to the 2.3 millions to get the super bonus game!
I know it's not much, but I had to donate again specifically for the banter between AuthorBlues and LackAttack24. Thank you both for the lulz and for this super great run!
Let's do what we can to stop this terrible disease. Also why 76? Adding three numbers together for 76, you have 25 25 and 26. If you assign those numbers to the letters of the alphabet by position, the letters you get are YYZ. Rest in peace to the Legendary Neal Peart. Gone too soon.
Had to donate during this immensely impressive run. Keep up the great work GDQ!
After years of watching VODs, finally watching GDQ live so I had to donate! Thanks for all the awesome runs. Let's keep going until cancer's health bar is empty! Putting this toward the bonus any% Goose Game run. Honk!
i lost both my grandpa and my dog this year to cancer in the past few months, and watching speedruns helps to fill the void of their absence. it helps knowing there are events like this working to make sure others can play the game of life in the cancer skip category
Gotta give money for that amazing save in the star road!
hell of a one mind run, these guys are putting on a show
On est pas fatigué ! Les runners de mario world sont fous !Puisqu'il fait plutôt nuit, j'aimerais bien cette #MarioLight
This Mario one mind is one of the most entertaining runs I’ve ever seen! Looking forward to the Dark Souls run next, and also staying awake for the next 24 more hours. Sleep will come...eventually...
Praise the sun!
This Mario run is amazing. GDQ HYPE
"One Mind" seems generous for this, but it was fantastic nonetheless!
The commentary, as well as a speed run of the Mario game that I hold near and dear to my heart, was a great way to end my night. Thank you so much
So: Invictus One Mind% when?
So happy and proud to see you up on the big stage Regole!! Good luck on the run, cherish every moment! Money to runner's choice, and I'll give $10 more for a first-try wrong warp :D
I liked that SMW One Mind run so much, please do more of that in the future!
I NEED A 96 EXIT ONE MIND RUN AS WELL AS ONE MIND HACKS FOR OTHER GAMES AT GDQ ASAP
A speeding game played/The frames flying past me/World record paceHaiku donation train?
One Mind was the most entertaining 15 minutes I've seen in a long time!
Love GDQ and the awesome runners this year! Praise the honk!
So, when do we get OneMind all castles? :D
AGDQ is always super fun to watch, and this Super Mario World run is no exception. My friend lost her mother to cancer last year, and I'm hoping we can find a cure soon. Good job Authorblues and Lackattack!
AuthorBlues and LackAttack bleed charisma. We need to see more of the two of them together.
Dark Souls hold a special place for us - our wedding last summer was themed after the game; it was in a castle and everything! Good luck on the run, and praise the sun!
Lost my Grampy to cancer the day after Christmas in 2018. So glad everyone can come together to help so many lives. Thank you runners, staff, and everyone else involved.
When's the One Mind 4-players-2-controllers run?
GDQ should make some branded socks. Would definitely buy some for a friend, they tear through them.
My grandfather recently had to quit kemotherapy for lung cancer after it was evident that it was no longer working, and as we make him as comfortable as possible for his final days, an event like AGDQ that I've watched for 10 years now never really hit home until this last year. Thank you AGDQ and PCF for all that you do. Lets end this disease once an for all!
Praise the honk \[+]/
OneMind was so good.
Praise the Hon....i mean Sun
That one mind mario run was hilarious. Looking forward to dark souls which is my favorite game of the past decade
I've been a fan of Dark Souls for so many years, so hyped for this run! Let's kill this cancer!
Thanks for putting on such a great event year after year. I always look forward to AGDQ!
Let's HONK to 2.4 million!
Let's all join in jolly cooperation to defeat cancer! Praise the sun!
Dark souls is one of my favorite games. Super amped for the run.
1st time donor. Happy to help. Send it to the dankest of souls. really enjoy the runs. "Hoooonk" out to leah and snowkitty,
The ADGQ has been so fantastic!! Been excited for the Dark Souls run this entire weekend to watch with my partner!! Lets darken some souls!
Happy to donate again for one of my favorite games Dark Souls! I'll donate a extra $5 if I can be joined in some jolly cooperation from the audience in PRAISING THAT SUN!
They want how much for the Link’s Awakening run? Guess we better get at it. For Scott.
Honk yeah it's Dark Souls time! I have put thousands of hours in this series and seeing it destroyed is almost as cathartic as destroying it yourself!
Been loving it all week, but these past few unique runs have been an absolute treat!
Best time of the year. Watching games and killing cancer. Praise the sun.
super excited for that trauma center run! good luck thurler!
Can we get another quick interview with Doctor Muffin to remind us what to do with Twitch Prime subscriptions?
I lost my mom to cancer when I was 13 so this event means a lot to me and I love dark souls so there’s no better time for me to donate :)
I look forward to this event every year. Happy to see so much love and generosity in the world. This donation goes out to Jim. Rest in peace.
Loved that one mind run and love the floppy ear hat in the audience!
What if instead of Praise the Sun it was Praise the Done and it was really fast?
Let’s join in jolly cooperation and start a $5 train during the Souls run! \[T]/ Praise the run! \[T]/
Excited to finally see one of these live, woot! Here's to a good cause.

Loved that Super Mario World one mind run! Love from Alaska, and kick cancer's butt!
Soo, when is the 96 Exit One Mind run?
We've Taken Control, So lets Make this explode, with talented actors!
Glad to be seeing some more A Hat In Time love in GDQ! Sad that I am about 5 days behind with this donation, but timing these donations in space requires math that I don't like doing, so I put it off for 5 days and then did the math. Turns out i waited too long. Oh well! I'm having fun watching you guys destroy these games, so please put Bowser in his place one more time! Unless this is the dark souls run. In which case, long may the sun shine! Math is hard.
Praise the sun, and praise that one mind run. Amazing stuff from AuthorBlues! Here's another contribution from our community pool!
I lost my dad to cancer this last year in may after his 30 year long off and on battle. Here's hoping this donation can help prevent another from losing a loved one. He wasn't a gamer, but the souls series is my favorite, so I wanted to donate during it in his name. Here's to you, Sully.
Hi AGDQ! I'm donating for my best friend, who recently overcame cancer in her knee. After chemo and surgery they got rid of the cancer, but they had to take part of her leg muscle with it, and the entire ordeal had her depressed for over a year.Recovering from cancer isn't just a physical challenge, there is also a serious emotional strain that may not be obvious if you haven't gone through it yourself or been there for someone who has - and it's still better than the alternative. The more we fund cancer research, the more people can receive treatment and survive. Let's make this the most successful GDQ ever.HONK
Mongo is a Turd
Dark Souls hype
Praise the sun and lets stomp out cancer!
Praise the HONK, shoutout to Speedfriends, stay comfy
Good luck Regole from all of us in Cata's chat!
I am looking for my Sun. If you have seen my Sun, please contact GDQ staff.
First time watching, but GDQ is my besty Kira's favorite. So we're watching it together, and I'm loving it!
Does your run have stairs?
Loving the runs this year and the cause, let's go.
That one mind run was worth at least a hundred dollars, so here it is.
No sleep till Super Metroid.

Lots of us in this org love playing games and appreciate GDQ. Beat Cancer as much as the University of Houston beats Rice in Football. Ya Woo Cancer Prevention,[please yell if you can] GO COOGS!
Every year Games Done Quick shows us new games, incredible spirit, and most of all, how gaming can bring people together and make the world a better place.Because of that, it's my honor to donate this money on behalf of my incredibly generous streaming community. I said I'd match them if they hit $2,020... If I'm being honest I didn't think they would but here we are.Do good, keep gaming, and let's see that music video!
Had to donate for Dark Souls, my favourite game of all time. Took the week off so I could watch the marathon, good job to everyone involved in such an awesome event! Dedicating this donation to my high school Japanese teacher who we lost to lung cancer just after graduation. Let's work towards a future where no one loses a friend or loved one to cancer.
Praise the Sun! let's start a $5 train to make sure we teach that super bonus game goal! Honkkkk
Hey AGDQ! Finally, Dark Souls. I love seeing this game getting torn apart.Also, let's kick cancers butt. Also, greetings from Germany :D
Hey AGDQ! The Dark Souls games have been incredibly important in keeping me sane over the past decade, and seeing these games run is always a highlight of GDQ for me. Plus, CovertMuffin on the mic? What an absolutely fantastic combination! Good luck with the run, Regole! Praise the sun, and, in the words of the most influential figure of this GDQ, HONK!
Dad starting chemo right now, which really makes me realize another level of sweetness in this event I've loved for a long time. Also:Be safe, friend. Don't you dare go hollow.
All the runs so far have been amazing; it's hard to believe the week's almost over. Let's get that Link's Awakening run and keep this going as long as we can.
I love you GDQ!
Love watching GDQ. Super hype for Dark Souls run
I love watching GDQ, almost as much as I love playing Dark Souls. Been doing both for years, and it still blows me away how quick you guys move. I can't wait to see the run. Praise the Honk, I mean sun.

Hi GDQ! First time donor from Sweden here. Thank you so much for all the awe-inspiring, entertaining content you provide for such a good cause. Cancer sucks, but you guys are a brilliant light against it's shadow. Many cudos and, of course, HONK!
Merci LFR pour le restream toutes ces années
For the last six years my best friend and I have made a tradition of hanging out and watching GDQ late into the night. It's been incredible watching the event grow each year, as more and more people come together to fight cancer and save frames. This year, for the first time, we get to watch as husband and wife. Here's $250 toward another ten years of GDQ bringing people together. And more importantly, towards watching Dr. Darling's magnum opus in control.
Bourrez les dons contre le cancer parce que le cancer c'est mal (sauf dans Binding of Isaac)! #CoeurBleu

Thanks to all the volunteers and speed runners for another GREAT GDQ!
My dad got diagnosed with cancer late last year. Some of my best memories from childhood are from gaming with him. So happy that gaming is being used to help prevent others from having to go through what my family is going through now.
moo
My mother defeated colon cancer, but due to genetics all of my siblings have a 50/50 risk. This donation is in hopes that some kind of cure is around the corner. Thank you all for everything that you do. Staff and runners alike. Let's band together and defeat cancer once and for all!
Dark Souls is one of my favorite series, and I've probably put more combined hours into Dark Souls 1 across 3 copies on 2 systems than any other game in my lifetime. Shout out to my friends in the crowd tonight, cancer has affected us all. $25 to Untitled Goose Game, to throw cancer in the lake.
My boyfriend really wants that swordy bonfiry thingy so here's my attempt to win it and help prevent cancer in the process.
Always glad to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation during AGDQ. Keep up the good work.
Congrats on GDQ to 10 years of Real Gamer Moments and genuine human goodness. But honestly, this is my favorite week of the year. Much love to production/staff, to Regole and all other runners for contributing their unbelievable talents, and to my friend Casey who got me both into speedrunning and into Dark Souls. PRAISE THE SUN!!!
It doesn't matter who we are, what matters is our plan
Much Love!
I lost my mother 4 years ago to Cancer and I lost my Dad last year to cancer last year. So this event has always been very special for me and others I know. So Honk your way to the Sun!
This donation is in memory of the legendary Neil Peart, who passed today from a three year long battle with brain cancer. Let's beat cancer, and good luck to all of the runners!
One super mario longboard please
This is my first year being able to catch GDQ live. I've seen some games (and many speedrunners) I've never heard of and all of it has been so entertaining. Glad I can help donate to a great cause and to help get that Link's Awakening incentive met.
<3 me some GDQ!
There are always way too many Basilisks, can we do something about that, fight Cancer, go faster.
Merci aux commentateurs et aux ambianceurs pour avoir animé ma première semaine de travail de nuit de l'année! #DarkMage
Mahalo for keeping me entertained while I lie sick on the couch these past few days.
Hey GDQ! Long time watcher and first time donating. Lost my grandfather to cancer when I was young so I'm happy that this money is going towards an amazing cause. Super hyped for the Dark Souls run coming up, one of my favorite game series of ALL TIME. Remember to pet Sif! He's a good pupper.
First time watching and donating. I just beat Control last week and this game was unforgiving to me, especially every time I died. My aunt survived cancer and my best friend growing up just beat cancer a few weeks ago so thanks to GDQ for helping where it counts.
Praise the sun!!
Loved the 1 mind Mario run and am so hype for Dark Souls! Prevent Cancer Foundation does such important work, and I love seeing the outpouring of support from this community. Also, that Dark Souls sword is pretty dang cool. Thanks to all who have donated, and to the runners and crew that make this possible. HONK!

Dark Souls with Regole! CovertMuffin! Control with Bryonato! Prolix! Cancer doesn't stand a chance! Donation to HONK!
Dark souls was the game that changed me from a “boy who played video games” to a “man that beat video games”. Here’s to hoping this event goes from supporting cancer treatment, to complete cancer prevention. Love the runs, the prizes, and of course... the honks!
Sbraaah looks like spaghetti.
Just wanted to say Get Well Soon to the love of my life Taylor in her fight with cancer right now. Thanks GDQ!

Greetings from Toronto! <3[DO NOT READ ON AIR: The donations page has a grammatical error... "Donations can enter you to win prizes!" ...or maybe not? In Soviet Russia, donations win you!]

Unfortunately, I haven't been able to catch as much of the marathon as I would have liked this year due to a busy work schedule but Agdq and Sgdq are a highlight of my year. Thank you for putting on this amazing event.
Ah, a fellow traveler! So glad you've come and are working hard to kill that dreaded cancer. Remember to watch out for patches and Praise the sun!
So many lovely prizes and a wonderful cause, could I possibly resist?No. The answer is no.Thanks to you, tech, runners, and chat all alike, for all that you do to support this cause. Praise the Sun and don't trust the gods!
Honk has been lit.
I've learned over the years that as long as you walk around with an envelope and a pen, people will just give you money. Weird, huh?This was raised by the awesome team over at BestNotes. Thanks guys! And thanks GDQ for bringing all of this together.
Hello Nick, Bobby, Mark, and Swaggy. Focus on the game nerds.
I've donated in GDQs past but after having cancer this past year, the cause is very close for me. Thanks to all the people who make my favorite event every year so special, and much love to William.
Videos from GDQ have provided me with far more than $100 worth of entertainment over the past couple of years. Happy to donate to a great cause. Can't wait to see that Ashtray Maze! TAAAKE. CONTROLLLLLL.
Two things: 1) Covertmuffin is a treasure and whomever is not paying him for his unbelievably soul-warming presence should begin paying him. Now. 2) The "shout out to space" meme from the FF8 run didn't catch on but I really feel like it should have.2a) Shout out to space.
I get excited every time GDQ comes around - keep up the great work, everyone! game on gamers
First time I've been able to donate. My dad is a survivor of cancer, 2 friends battling it now with a long road to go and lost my aunt two years ago. Trying to do my part to help prevent cancer.

Hey GDQ! Always loved the Souls series, and having it being speedrun is something I could never imagine on my first playthrough. I'd like to thank all of the amazing people in the back who made this event possible!
love to always see this game getting runned, i think dark souls is one of the greatest games ever made and is a work of art, so it's always great to see it become destroyed. (read 'become destroyed' like that)
Greetings from Aersia! Cancer is the Dark Souls of real life!
the dark souls games are my favorite of all time. praise the sun. praise the runners and the staff \o/
Praise the Run!
The runs this week have been amazing; always great to hang out with friends and watch great entertainment as games are broken.
My dad called me on a saturday to tell me he had colon cancer. Two months later after some screening, I was diagnosed with T3N0M0 adenocarcinoma as well. Like father like son! Happy to say we've both been cancer free for three years now! Praise the sun, and thank you to this amazing community for having my back when I needed it most
Oh, hello there. I was simply gazing at the sun here in the wonderful sunshine state! Oh how I've waited for this moment for GDQ to finally be in a place so grossly incandescent. I was so excited to see some SMB jolly co-operation. The sun is a wondrous body, however, the American Cancer Society recommends limiting exposure to it during 10am and 4pm and, if not possible, to use a screen of sun of at least 30 SPF. Respect the sun and also, PRAISE THE SUN!!!!!!
Beating the game faster than it took me to beat the first boss? Please, take my money. Thanks for supporting an important cause.
I never realised that when the game told me to "Prepare To Die", it was actually giving me a helpful hint about how to reset universal cycles...HONK!
I love my brave and wonderful friend, Maddie B.
Hey Mark! It's Trevor from the office!

Allways look forward to agdq! I love watching the games that gave me such grief getting totally destroyed.
Dark Souls is one of my favorite games. The way Regole just bodied Orstein and Smough is amazing. Praise the sun and beat the cancer!
Gotta donate during one of my favorite games. I seem to remember a lot more messages about "You Died".
Lost one friend to brain cancer. Have another one who survived colo-rectal cancer. Eff cancer.
Praise the Sun!! Shoutout to all the speedrunners, no hit runners and the awesome Souls-community. Greetings and happy saturday from germany.
Heyo I’m in vrc rn and watching the stream from there. Love hat you’re contributing to great charities! Help prevent cancer everyone!!!
Félicitations et merci à vous pour ce restream FR depuis tant d'années. Bon week end à tous et big up de Belgique #MarioLight
Oh, wow, I love the beef jerky RPG.
So stoked for the control run. It's time we TAKE CONTROL over cancer. TAKE CONTROL!
Regole's run is like the Dark Souls of AGDQ runs
I'm a childhood cancer survivor, and I wouldn't be here today to watch Regole's awesome Dark Souls speed run without the generosity of people like y'all! Let's beat cancer so more people can enjoy these amazing runs!
finally catching agdq live during a time i can afford to give a little. this event is always so amazing to watch and it’s for a great cause, what’s not to love? loving this dark souls action and good luck to regole on the rest of the run!
Ornstein and Smough were responsible for the majority of my deaths in my first playthrough, and Regole just absolutely wrecked them. If only I could be so grossly incandescent! Praise the honk!
Siegmeyer of Catarina here to humbly thank you for all of your assistance. Here is a a small donation from me to aid you on your noble quest.
Can't stop that hype train!
Hang in there, skeleton.
Man, watching this Dark Souls run makes me realize I played the game like a chump. by swinging the Dragon's Tooth using its own moveset.
Here's to the prevention and early detection of cancer and the lives it can save. Thank you to GDQ and the Prevent Cancer Foundation for all that you do. Put this towards the Link's Awakening incentive, and for a chance at that amazing banner. LONG LIVE THE HONK!
Nice to see the greatest game of all time run at GDQ!
Need that Link's Awakening run. Praise whatever, HONK the sun.
Finally have a job that allows me to contribute to GDQ. Love to watch my favorite game of all time get broken, lets kick cancers butt and those bosses. PRAISE THE SUN
Always look forward to these events! Always lifts me from going through every day struggles!
A big shoutout to Regole who has spent so much time teaching people this game, if you were learning or doing a run, he was there. SpeedSouls would not be the same without him. Thank you for being a good teacher and friend. Happy Birthday Regole, from all the people watching you and cheering you on.
You guys are incredible, I love the explanations and expert play on one of my favorite Souls game! Thank you for keeping me wide awake at work tonight!
My daughter turned 1 at the start of this AGDQ and it's been awesome sharing some of the amazing speed runs with her after work this week. Donating so she doesn't have to live in a world plagued by cancer.
Didn't mean to hold out my dono till Souls on a Friday night, but no regrets. Especially when you have such a skilled player and amazing teacher on the couch. Thanks to both of you.
Love your enthusiasm Covert_Muffin!
PRAISE THE RUN!!!
My brother and I love the Dark Soul series, from the lore, the music and the beautiful level design. He moved away recently and watching this run reminds me of the good times. Hope he's watching and Praise the Sun!
GDQs are always highpoints to my year. Thank you and keep up the amazing work!
Hey, you missed killing a couple mobs.
Hey Grimelios (Mark)! It's Trevor from the office! Praise the sun!
Haven't tune in as much this year due to work, but here is my part for a good cause. Praise the Sun.
The guy on the couch is completely on point with the commentary. Fantastic run guys, keep it up!
Be wary of donation
Good Luck To The Runners!
Had to donate during the dark souls run, this game means the world to me, and seeing it get kicked in the frames is incredible every time.Praise the sun and Praise the PCF
Love the souls games and got to get in for those awesome prizes. Praise the Sky Orb \[T]/
I had to donate during this run. Regole is doing a really good job and the commentator is doing an excellent job as well.Also, thank you to every volounteers, runners, hosts and couch commentator that made this event truly amazing.
Had to donate for my favorite game ever. Run looks great so far! Praise the sun!
Had to donate during the game of the decade! Dark Souls RULES!
After how many people I helped guide through Sen's Fortress back in the day, I can't help but be blown away after seeing Regole just blaze through it. Love GDQ, keep being awesome everyone. Honk at the Sun! (that's how that line goes, right?)
Dark souls is one of my favourite games so this seemed like the time to donate! Best of luck to the runners!
Happy to see Dark Souls getting more love. barbSouls!
Loving this Dark Souls run. Lets beat cancer. \o/
In honor of Neil Peart, may he rest in peace.

Ummmmmmbasa!!
CANCER SLAUGHTERED
PRAISE THE SUN 🌞
Praise the sun, praise AGDQ
Can't believe Regole is steamrolling a game that I had so much trouble with years ago! If only I could be so grossly incandescent! Honk!
Dark Souls is one of my favorite games of all time, and I couldn't think of a better time to donate. I love watching AGDQ each year, and it's great seeing everyone come together for such a great cause. Let's keep this awesome marathon going! Praise the sun!
Thanks to all the runners and staff that put on such a great show for such an amazing cause. Best of luck and praise the sun!
Donating in memory of my Oma on her birthday, at the age she is forever. Strong enough to defeat it once, the second form was too much for her. Let's all donate to finally beat cancer in all its forms.
Praise the sun! You're awesome GDQ and shoutouts to the amazing commentary from the couch.
Long time viewer first time donator! Praise the sun!
Love Dark Souls! Love AGDQ! This is going toward Bonus Links Awakening! Praise the Honk!
LETS GET A PRAISE THE SUN DONATION TRAIN GOING!
glad to see im not the only one who died in this gamegl all
Had to send a donation during one of my favorite games of all time. I lost my mom just a few months ago to cancer and wish for this donation to help someone in need so that they never have to experience what my mom went through. Thank you GQD for putting on this fantastic event to help stop cancer. Can I get a PRAISE THE SUN!?
I have to get up but 7am but I had to watch another GDQ run of DS1 because I love the runners, and couch members for their knowledge, and love of the game. But once this is all said and done, I'll be going to bed thinking, "Plin plin plon" *tear*
Thank you for what you're doing!Greetings from Germany
GDQ Rocks! Got introduced to it last year and immediately binged every video on the youtube channel! Can't get enough
This is probably a little more than I can really afford right now, but considering my old pathfinder GM/board game buddy lost his fight with cancer just this past November... It's worth it. He always hated Dark Souls too, so maybe he'd find it funny. F-cancer, Praise the Sun! \ [T] /
Praise the Sun,Praise the run!Kill the game,an' save the frames!Let's defeat cancer!
This Dark Souls run is very *lit*Good luck on the run Regole 🙂
First time I've been able to be at GDQ in person! I love how accepting everyone is - and I'm even more impressed at all the people behind the scenes making these events go so smoothly! Grats on 10 years - and on the next 10!
Dark Souls Honk!
Thanks for the amazing dark souls run!
Give it to me. . . that thing there. . . your Dark Souls any% speedrun. (put this toward runner's choice)
My wife and I have been watching VODs for a few years but this is our first time watching live and we're loving it. We want to do our part to make sure we can crack $2 million this year! Keep up the amazing work runners! Everything counts in large amounts.
Have to go to bed now because I have stuff to do tomorrow, but I wanted to be sure to get my donation in. It's always a joy to see new memes and jokes pop up every honking year. I've been loving all the runs I've been able to watch this past week, and I'm looking forward to many more hours of fun catching up on the ones I missed. Praise the sun, and down with cancer!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!!! you wild man, and great stream all week everyone.good bye cancer
Oi, greetings from northern Canada! I love what gdq has become and done over the mant years! Cheers to the runners, crowd and chat!
Thanks for giving us a break. Praise the Sun.
Always love to see my favorite game get destroyed on stream. Makes me feel like anything is possible. Love dark souls and AGDQ. *Sang like Enter Sandman by Metallica* ANOR.LONDO 🎶 ANOR LONDO 🎶 TAKE MY HAND 🎶 WE'RE OFF TO ANOR LONDO LAND 🎶💕
Fancy that, happy birthday Regole, it's mine too!
j'ai mi plus de 100h avec de l'aide pour finir le 1er dark souls .... j'en ai mal a mon pti coeur de voir autant de skill :D #MarioLight
That dark souls run was AMAZING. very humbling - amazing job both of you!
Thanks to all of you for this great event. And now let us TAKE CONTROL over cancer!
That was an awesome Dark Souls run! Looking forward to Control, and let's keep those donations rolling in!
Thanks for being so awesome.
Every time GDQ comes around I leave it on non-stop at home and at work. For the whole week you guys bring me days full of positivity and joy! I also leave it on while I sleep which leaves me with some very confusing dreams especially when I hear "Orb" and "Honk" being shouted. Continue with the good vibe!
Thanks for the amazing dark souls run!
Praise the Honk!
 (Comment rejected)
as we must... Praise the HONK!
Praise the Sun!!!
As I watch these speed-runs in complete awe, I remember that today is my good friend Varius' birthday. Happy Birthday, Varius! And a big shoutout to the entire backend team/runners at AGDQ. You guys are making my week!I'll donate again if the announcer can give Blueglass a big "What's Up!" from me! We miss you YSG!
THUNDER CROSS SPLIT ATTACK
I gotta be honest - I'm kinda bored with the Hiss, sis. They started out all fun with the intonations and red auras and whatnot, but I don't even get to fly or nothing. I'd rather just have a nice burger instead at this point. So come speedrun this really trashy, office looking hotel and TAKE CONTROL
Was going to donate anyway, but I found out we lost the legendary drummer Neil Peart this week, and I had to add in an extra 21.12 for him. Thanks to the crew, hosts and runners; what an amazing show you all put on!
J'ai jamais fini un darksoul ça fait plaisir de le voir se faire malmener comme ça !Bon début de matinée à tout le monde ! #Kyogre
I've watched every GDQ since the original, so I want to wish everyone a happy 10 year anniversary!
Truly hyped for Control, my favorite game from last year. And not to alarm anyone, but this donation is an Object of Power...
Video games are my entire life, and seeing them beaten so fast is incredible. I've watched AGDQ for several years now, and my Grandmother passed from Kidney Cancer 7 years ago. Keep up the good work!
Dernier don de la semaine, un total de 25€. C'est tout ce qu'on peut se permettre avec mon conjoint, mais nous vous remercions tous pour votre travail, le staff français comme américain. Des bisous !
From my community to AGDQ! Had a hype train in the stream and it's choo-choo-ing it's way to the Prevent Cancer Foundation with boxcars full of cash. Donation goes to naming the Castlevania filename after the late, great NeilPert.
Roses are red, praise the sun, I love GDQ, what a great run!
You thought this was Zoidberg, but it was me, DIO!
Wife and I love GDQ events and we love to support the causes!
I think what all the runners, announcers, and staff at AGDQ do is absolutely amazing, so here's my small contribution. If anyone watching agrees, please consider donating whatever you can. There's over 100,000 people watching! Just imagine if everyone donated just a dollar! I'm sure if we work together we can beat this awful disease.
Had to show some love to one of my favorite games in the last decade. Control is simply amazing! Will donate another $25 if we can have serious time during the Ashtray Maze.
Bonjour control! Let’s beat cancer
SAY NO TO CANCER!
Keep the speed going! Greetings from Canada!
pas de temps d'Hashtag!
#dargymcborky Hey Bry, had to donate to keep the correct language choice. AYO

Second donation for this memorable AGDQ!I never knew my maternal grandfather, he left when my mom was 18, at the age of 48, after having fought for a little more than 5 years against lung cancer which is then spread to the throat ...Cancer is a real plague, a big heart for all those who suffer from it as well as the loved ones who have to face the pain of the fight as well as that of the loss of a loved one.Thank you to the entire French Restream team for your incredible involvement, and to the most fun, crazy and generous cat in France!Love u all

Long time watcher, first time donator, but I finally caved and donated when I saw the prizes. This community still blows my mind! My sincere thanks to everyone involved but especially the crowd tonight for keeping it going for everyone watching on the West coast. =)
My wife and I love watching every GDQ event. I've lost three family members to cancer and my cousin doesn't have much time left in her battle, so everything you all do means so so much. Thank you to everyone for everything you do and I know all of your efforts are helping to save lives!! Happy 10 year anniversary and here's to 10 more!

#dargymcborky It feels like yesterday I was chilling in your streams while you ran Titanfall 2 ILs to lofi and math rock. It's been a blast seeing your passion for speedrunning develop over the years to what it is now and where it's taken you with just how much energy you put into it. Getting to witness that passion and skill with everyone else watching your run at every GDQ you're a part of is truly inspiring. Stay awesome and go fast bry, House Redfoot will be cheering you on!
Excited to see how the game I used to help route has changed, can't help but donate during the Control run. Good luck Bryon for the run and good luck to all the runners.
In Memory of Rush's Neil Peart, who passed away this week after a three and a half year battle with brain cancer.His music brought excitement and inspiration to so many countless numbers of us and will live on for generations.Thank you GDQ team for all the amazing runs and joy you provide us time and time again.
Here's to CONTROL Alt Deleting this game's walkthrough time, and cancer in the process!

Greetings from Finland! Ahti the janitor here. Reminding my assistant to fix the coolant pumps and the energy converters. You'll make sure to do that, right? Right?
Hey Bryonato, thank you so much for demonstrating this awesome game and for not shaving the stellar stash. Remember...You are a worm through time. A copy of a copy of a copy. You can almost hear our words but you forget.
Had to donate during the run for my favorite game of last year. Bryonato has been wonderful with his commentary during this GDQ and I am very excited to see him Take Control.This donation is for my friend Rich, who sadly lost his battle with cancer 2 years ago. Thanks to all of GDQ for your help in the fight to beat cancer.

Control is an amazing game and I can't wait to see how broken is it is. Also I REEEEALLY want to see the the Ashtray maze, because it is awesome!
You are a worm through time. The thunder song distorts you. Happiness comes. White pearls, but yellow and red in the eye.
Staying up too late for a great game and great run.
Much love
I’m very excited to watch Control, my favorite game last year, get torn to pieces. Good luck and thank you for this wonderful event!
Been watching since the beginning. Love speed-running and love gaming. My mom went through cancer treatments and has been cleared for a few years now. I wanted to donate here during one of my favorite games of all time, not just the past year. Control. And a HUGE thank you to EVERYONE (even Keizaron ! Anamorphs DOS wink ) for doing what you do to put this on every year! GOODLUCK! With that I say it's a Hon.....nor to take part. What you thought I would say... HONK!?

So excited to see Bryonato run Control. Been watching his stream for a few years and can't wait for more. From couching Titanfall 2 at SGDQ 2017 to couching with Sent and the prizes at AGDQ 2019. Always excited to see you run some of my favorite games. If only you had BT to throw you across these Control levels. Donation goes to runners choice.
#dargymcborky bryonato is cutest speedrunner boiiiiiii
we couldn't pick a better runner to show off all the sick tech in this game, LET'S GO BRY #dargymcborky
Hey GDQ! Hey Bryo!Long time watcher, first time donator. Some amazing speedrunning has happened tonight.Found out the drummer of my all time favourite band, Rush, passed away to brain cancer, so I HAD to make a donation. May you rest in peace, Neil Peart.
GDQ has done so much to bring us together over the years, and it's great to see such an entertaining [REDACTED] of one of our favorite [REDACTED]. [REDACTED] luck, [REDACTED]!
Been looking forward to watching Bryonato run Control all week. Great game, great runner, great cause. AYOOO!
Never seen Control before, but I'm exited to see the game broken and get minimal amounts of story! Honk!
Hey Bryon! Loving the Control run. I am so honored to be a part of your lovely streaming community. Go kick some Hiss butt! #dargymcborky
Had to donate for my favorite game of 2019. Let's take Control of cancer. You guys are dyn-o-mite! Also, [REDACTED]
Been looking forward to this run all week. What an absolute dream team runner and couch combination! From Tom and Cory, good luck on the run Bry! Shout out to The Lounge!
Control is the game of the year. That's it, that's my comment. Good luck with the run.
Amazing run, I'm currently playing through the Dark Souls Trilogy for the first with my brothers and they are not as easy as Regole made it seemed! Praise the sun, and the run!
Sending a lot of support from Remedy Entertainment! It's very early morning in Finland but we're awake and cheering you on! This is the first time in a while anyone is running a Remedy game, and we all think it's pretty cool that Bryonato has decided to take Control. Hey, Bryonato, YOU'RE awesome, how about that? EYOOOO!
Getting to watching AGDQ over the week leading up to my birthday every year is an amazing treat. After losing my mom to cancer back in 2015 it is such a heartwarming thing to see so many people stand up to fight cancer. HONK.
Great to see this run on AGDQ! Jippii saatana!
first time watcher, excited to see control
I am The Director.
It's great to catch another Bryonato run. Can't wait to see Honky Mc Gunny. Ayo!
Hey, all! I'm an actual staff member for the SCP Foundation wiki and I've been hyped to see this run all week! Good luck and go fast!

Cleanse the duck - Quack Quack, Honk honk.
Hey AGDQ, long time viewer, first time donator! I hope everyone is enjoying the event, and I hope one day to be there myself supporting the runners. Donation goes towards runners choice.
Control was my favorite game of 2019. Y'all wild because this was absolutely not how I played it. HONK!
Great Commentary, but could we have the game a tad bit louder? Thanks!
Control was one of my favourite game of last year. It’s nice to see it at AGDQ played so masterfully. But I would like to say, I don’t see a lot of French on screen...
Good luck on the run Bry. Great to see all the work you’ve put into the run pay off. Ayo!
Donating during the run of my favorite game of last year. Can't wait to see what Bryonato is going to do to break the game. Thank you everyone for the weeks of fun and millions of dollars that you've raised for PCF.
I love ADGQ and everything you guys do! keep it up!
Been having a blast with this year's GDQ so far, here's to all the folks out there struggling in the fight with cancer.
We love GDQ, and we love Control! The whole family's watching here, and the kids decided we should donate now. Love you Miri!
Shoutout to Bry for this sick run, Kaboos for dropping a hundred dollar dono last night with the wrong hashtag, and ROCKET LEAGUE FRIDAYS FOR EXISTING#DARGYMCBORKY #DARGYMCBORKY #DARGYMCBORKY
(Read slashes aloud. Thanks. <3)You/We wield the Run/You. The Board appoints you. Congratulations, Director.
Thank you to everyone running games and helping to keep GDQ happen. Let's get the Legend of Zelda bonus game met because more GDQ is always good.
Had to stay up late in order to donate doing the run of Control, my Game of the Year for 2019! And so far, I can say that staying up this late for it was worth it! Keep up the amazing work!
A modest contribution to help doing extraordinary things. Shoutout to LFR. Garde la pêche! #MarioLight
#dargymcborky Long butt watcher, butt time donator. Love to donate to such a butt cause with butt a great run. Let’s butt Bryonato!
I've been excited for this run all week. Bryanoto's Titanfall 2 runs are amazing, and I know this one will be no different. And with KZ_Frew, CovertMuffin, and Prolix involved, how can you go wrong?
I never know what to say in these comment sections
GDQ, I love you! This donation is for my grandfather who is surviving with prostate cancer. Better prevention screening would have lead to treatment, but now our only option is to cherish every day we have with him. Let's donate to give our families and future families a longer time with their loved ones.
The cutest speedrunner of all time? Running Control at AGDQ?? More likely than you think. Good Luck Bry, I love you <3 #dargymcborky
Greetings from Medical School! I haven't had much time to play video games in the last three years but I DID play Control and it became an all-time favorite instantly. Take some student loan money in the hopes that AGDQ and PCF make my future job a little bit easier. This run and runner are DYNAMITE!
Love to see one of my favorite games of 2019 being run by one of my favorite runners of GDQ! Can’t wait to see what this run has in store.
hey, chat here! we can't hear the game! please turn it up!
Object of power! Honk!
Hi "glasses guy"! Been looking forward to this run all week, best of luck! :D
Hello Bry and crowd! Hope your gdq is going great, this run sure is. I wish you the best of luck! And remember to CONTROL yourself when you totally get a pb! #DARGYMCBORKY
I've haven't had much time to watch GDQ this year, so I'm glad I caught my favorite game of last year.
AGDQ was one of the first things my fiancee and I bonded together over. Every year we look forward to watching amazing people speed run our favorite games. Thank you AGDQ and here's to another ten years!!

Loving AGDQ2020 I always watch and support this event year after year without any worries of cancer unfortunately this year cancer has creeped into my family and we’re facing a tough time however watching this event always gives me hope and puts a smile on my face for all the jokes and puns that come about thank you for all the hard work the staff and runners put into this event keep up the good work!

You guys are amazing, and how could I not donate when you're playing my husbands most recent video game crush! I love you Julian, and I love all of you guys at AGDQ that are crushing cancer!

Had to donate during and awesome game run by my favorite streamer! Donation goes to runners choice.
Shoutout to Bryonato for his amazing speedrun of [REDACTED]!
Hey Bryan, speedrunning is a really cool Project M to work on. I love seeing all your PK Tech. Don't forget to double jump cancel. Good luck on the run! Okay!
#dargymcborky love ya bry just get some control over slidey mcgunny
Have to add a second dono for SlidyMcGunny even if it doesn't want to cooperate this time
One of the Max causes of Payne in the world is cancer. It's so awful it keeps me Alan Wake all night. This donation is to Quantum Break free of this scourge, and to Take Control of a brighter future. Good luck Bryonato, and all runners!
First time donator! AGDQ is killing my work productivity! As an old gamer. It’s great seeing all these games I need to try, like Control! Good luck Bryonato! Let’s get Links Awakening met!
Control was my GOTY for 2019, have to donate during this run. It is already a blast as Bryonato works on this elevator glitch. Can't wait for the rest of the run. "YOU ARE A WORM THROUGH TIME. THE THUNDER SONG DISTORTS YOU."
Bry have you heard the word.Bird is the word
Neil Peart and his band Rush got me through a lot of hard times. I have always enjoyed GDQ, but never donated. With his passing yesterday I am motivated to be more than just a spectator. Long live Rush, and long live GDQ
This donation is for my friend, Alice, who introduced me to CONTROL. The world is so quirky and fun, and this run has been blowing our minds. Keep up the great run! Don't let marathon luck get to you!
Altered Item 4319 a downpatched version of Control has the power to raise money to fight cancer when paired with a great team and runner. Worth keeping an eye on. And donating!
Screw cancer lmao
#MarioLight
Thank you for running one of mine and my partners favourite game. Marathon luck is legit yo, dont panic little bannock you got this!
#dargymcborky bryonato has control over Control.. do i smell a !speedquote?
Can we get a round of applause for Bryonato’s bow tie? It’s an object of power.
This is a message from the SCP foundation. We have ruled that this event to be a Keter class anomaly Due to the extreme number of anomalies in digital realities that these 'speed runs' take advantage of in order to complete video games in an impossibly fast manner we have no choice to continue to observe this event. While containment does not seem possible, given the benevolent nature of this SCP we have elected to encourage it to run its course with this donation, and urge others to do the same for research purposes.
A Control developer from Finland here, it physically hurts to see you abuse the game like this. It’s awesome. Keep up the good work!
Bien en place pour profiter d'un week-end de repos et du beau jeu. Mais d'abord petite pensée émue pour tout les survivants du staff pour la fin du marathon. Courage et merci pour votre travail. #Tempetedesang
Good money going to a great cause, HONK!!
No commen...HONK!
Here's a little something for that bad marathon luck! How dare you think you can "control" this game
Ayyo! #DARGYMCBORKY
Wanted to donate the little that I could during Control to wish Bry the best of luck. TAKE. CONTROL. Donation toward runner's choice.
<3
Once again Bryo delivers some amazing runs for GDQ. Slidey McGunney hype!
SCP personnel Bryonato, Prolix, and CovertMuffin have commenced additional measures in attempts to subdue a subject similar to SCP-253. Methods employed thus far have included [redacted]. Request for additional funding: granted.
My mum survived pancreatic cancer thanks to incredibly lucky early detection. Donating during one of my favourite games of the last year to help take control of these terrible diseases!
Hey Prolix! I've been wanting you to say this since last year's AGDQ: Shout out to people wondering what the opposite of "in" is.
Let's get some energy from the crowd for this hype run! Gooooo Bryonato!
$75 for a chance at that Massive Sony Prize Pack & PS4 Pro?I can't control myself... there's simply no remedy for this.Now hopefully I can stay awake long enough to enjoy Slidey McGunny and the rest of this run.Keep up the good work and thank you so much for putting some good and positivity back into a world that sorely needs it. Much love and may RNGesus favor the runners from now through the end of the marathon.
With all the great prizes being offered I just couldn't control myself. Let's keep working toward that milestone everyone!!
I knew you'd get Slidy Bry. My hope wasn't...Faden.
Heck it! I'm donating twice because dat redemption arc is lit. Dig deep, remember your training!
Slidy, A little gun on the run
If we have slidey McGunny and Floaty Boxy, why not Donaty McCharity. Good luck from the back couch and remember to take Control.
Control is one of my favorite games from 2019, and it's super rad to see an awesome run like this!
Loving this run. Bryonato seems really cool and the trick names are fantastic. My dad is a cancer survivor and I appreciate GDQ for all the money they raise towards preventing cancer.
Hey there. Awesome run Bryon, I'm really glad to be catching this one so early in the morning, and congrats on SlidyMcGunny. Also, cheers to Covertmuffin, love you guy. Thanks for the event, keep up the good work.
Love you guys, thank you for everything that you do!
No, I didn’t want to believe it. You can’t be a gun!
This slidey mcgunny is out of control
#dargymcborky Bryonato is the cutest speedrunner I've ever seen boiiiii good job getting slide mcgunney and good luck on the rest of your speedruns for the rest of your gee dee life
Hey Bryon! SgtBaha here. You were kind enough to greet me and remember me when i met you here. You were the biggest inspiration for me to attend because i needed to see you do your magic live. Much love and keep running!
This looks like such a cool game! Donating both for this game and Dank Souls, one of my favorite series of all time.
One could say getting slidey was the perfect Remedy. Cheers on an entertaining run.
Had to donate while a Project M OG is running; good luck to Bryonato!
Hello from freezing Finland. It's awesome to see a game you've made getting broken in front of more than 100k people. I heard Expeditions is a pretty neat mode.
Been loving all the runs this year! Having a great time the whole week and am excited to see the week close out! Donating this tonight in the name of the late great Neil Peart! While hearing the news of his loss against brain cancer is very upsetting, it brings up the mood when I get to watch everyone having a good time playing awesome games really fast! Thanks to GDQ Staff, the Runners, the Couch Crew, and everyone else that makes this event possible! It is because of you that many people from around the world can have hope in what may be a dark time for them. Thanks again and let's make that push to $2million! HYPE!
Wanted to get this in earlier for the Pokemon Blue incentive but forgot my PayPal password :(. Luckily we still got to see its awesomeness.
Great way to take control of the game
Fun fact: in SCP, the common name for a contained object is "skip". So between Skip and Control, this may be the highest pun count in the whole marathon!
First time donating!! Just thank everyone to provide another great week of entertainment and for a great cause!! Let's kick cancer's butt!!
This donation goes out to my girl Aqua in the Birth by Sleep bid war~
Just wanted to help get Dr. Zoidberg here to help out all those poor patients.
#dargymcborkyShoutout to rocket league friday and bryonato for being reasons to live. Love you beej almost as much as I love melee Kappa
I wake up so late and I missed so much of the Control run, oh no! The movement and optimisations make this run look crazy to me, who struggled to beat it casually. Amazing job!
This is my second year watching and first time donating and what better time to donate then now? Hopefully Bryanato had everything under Control
Wow in less than an hour you’ve already caught up to my casual play through. Please tell that you’ll save Phillip from the fridge?! HE CANT KEEP STARING AT IT! Anyways my aunt survived cancer a few years back and now is visiting my family right now. She lives in Berlin so I guess you could say it’s ‘greetings from Germany.’ Anyways this is a fantastic game, runner, cause, and GDQ. Hopefully we can get that bonus goose game run. Thank you to everyone involved. <3
Early morning crew HYPE!! This is for my fallen family to cancer over the last 10 years. My kids and I always make sure to spend our extra money to PCF and DWB every marathon. GLHF and save those frames!!!
Thanks for all the entertainment. Today is my birthday and what better way to celebrate than giving. Cheers to all the runners, staff, attendees, and twitch chat. Also much love to my son Alexander Fly. 100 extra if you read this. : )
Long time donor, first time viewer...?Couldn’t catch most of the runs due to work, but what I could is as jaw dropping as always.Put this to declaring GDQ week an international holiday!
I can't make time to watch this GDQ because of having to prepare for an upcoming interview, but shoutout to all the runners!
Bryan this run is insane. Amazing work! This is my first GDQ donation and your run is what got me to contribute.
#DARGYMCBORKY FBC is an acronym I'd never though I'd fear but then instagib on reach was like tribes. I'm glad to catch once another bryonato GDQ.
Bonjour de France and good luck for the run ! EH OH !
Control is great fun to play casually. But it’s also great fun to watch Bryonato play it like a Director. :)
All crisp and no crust. Killing it, man!
Control is one of my favorite games of all time and watching you play Control makes me want to run Control. Teach me senpai!
Really gratifying to see that Salvadore guy slapped down so quicklyAyo.
AGDQ Controls my wallet during this run. And another nudge toward Through The Fire.
An NPC that actually has my name?!? I know what game I'm playing next! Had to donate for slidey mcgunny. Probably one of the best skips I've ever seen!
#zhtSonic
Ayyyy lets get it man! Been following you for not too long now but watching your wolfie run yesterday and this run today has solidified you as one of my new favorite runners. Shoutouts to a god tier player and a god tier game studio! Remedy > all.
Just lost my 29 year old cousin to cancer. Lets kick cancers butt and make it so no one else has to deal with that
AYO, at least here I can use my normal Nickname Super hyped for the run and next month ;)Good Luck Bry and House Redfoot Hype!!
My sister was 4 years old when she was diagnosed with cancer. Almost 20 years of being cancer free and down 1 kidney. She now is married, has a house, and her first child on the way in June. Thankfully it was found soon enough and taken care of or I would have never found out how wonderful of a person she is as I was only a few months old when she was going through chemotherapy. I’m donating so others may not have a life ended before it started. And others to be with their families longer than what would have been, because every moment with the ones you love is precious. Here’s to the end of cancer. Thank you all speedrunners and staff for the amazing things you all do. Honk
Report: Bureau's field agents secured the gamepad during Awesome Games Done Quick 2020 charity event. The item seems to be an Object of Power, allowing a player to break out of bounds of any room it's used in. A few agents are still considered missing after initial tests with sound of honking coming from walls afterwards. Needs further investigation.
You thought it was zoidberg, but it was me, DIO,
Great event for a great cause
Hey Bry, So happy to donate during your run. Happy 10th anniversary AGDQ. Let’s beat cancer
Always love watching AGDQ, making my graveyard shift quite a bit more fun. Glad to donate for such a great cause.
:)
I'm really glad to be able to donate to this event again. My grandmother recently beat cancer, and I hope others can catch cancer as early as her and beat it so easily. Donation goes to runner's choice and I'll donate another 25 if it's goose game any% run.
I love watching you guys year after year. I can't wait to see how high we can go, and how high we will fly in years to come! Keep kicking butt GDQ!
Lonk
all I can say is: Shut up and take my money! lol Much thanks to the whole GDQ staff who keep this event running so smoothly. you guys rock!
Dynamite
Been watching since 2015 and finally able to donate multiple times. SLove all GDQ's
I had to donate again during my favorite game of the year. Thank you all for your hard work in putting this together.
I drifted off during Control and woke up to cries of "time!" and fake credits. I've never been jebaited so hard.
For all the Tendie Gamers out there. Heck cancer.
#zhtDoom
Been waiting all week for this run. The skill is crazy amazing. Hope your wrists don't get too sore. All the best of luck
Seeing doctor Darling doing dynamite this early in the morning is going to get me through this 12 jour work shift. Thank you.
Awesome Control run and awesome runner! Thanks for the late night speed awesomeness!
I'm filming a 3 hour long dance recital today but there was no way I was missing this trauma center run. Good luck on your miracle surgeries!
Super important for announcers because it keeps happening today: Neil Peart is "Peert" NOT "Purt". Cheers! Thank you for everything you do!
hoping to help someone :) thanks for stream
Bonjour je passait dans "le coin" alors je donne ^_^Bon courage à vous Des bisous #DarkMage
After losing my grandmother to cancer and seeing one of my close friends punch it in the face and live through it, I don't want anyone else to have to go through that. It really warms my heart seeing all these people coming together for a good cause. Donation goes to Prolix's Choice
Thank you to all the runners and staff. Looking forward to seeing Poo and the gang destroy those SMM2 levels later on!
100 bucks as promised for reading. Also my wife was hoping for an enthusiastic HONK!
[FR] Toujours un plaisir de venir commenter ! Merci à tous c'était super et oublié pas de passer votre jeu en français c'est important #MarioLight
I remember watching my brother play trauma center when i was younger and now he really does it as an ER doctor! first time donation and you guys rock! thank you for what you do!
For my fellow FFXIV players in chat- LA HEE!Hey Yisk, try not to forget to pet the cat. Thanks!
Donation goes to the choice of that girl in the audience with the flappy-eared hat.
Lost my Uncle to liver cancer last night, this donation is in his honor. Thanks again to Games Done Quick for all of the good that it provides, let's beat cancer as fast as possible.
thanks to everyone at AGDQ for the background noise and entertainment. It’s the least I can do, due to losing a few friends to cancer and those who have survived. Keep up the great titles and speed running
praise the sun \[T]/
I’ve seen that girl and her hat every night all week and my desire to own it is strong
Ten dollars each for dance dad and hat girl. YOU guys have really run the marathon in 2020!
Hey ghosty! Miss the streams and god of boi, can’t wait till next time and hope all is well. Keep up the good work and remember we are all proud of you!
Loving the runs so far ! You guys are amazing people, and i cant thank you all enough ! Keep rocking on, and sending lots of hugs to everyone in GDQ ! =)
Bryonato's runs never cease to entertain!Dedicating this donation to my mom - she lost both her kidneys to cancer last year but has stayed strong through everything that's happened and we're thankfully close to the 1 year cancer free mark!Good luck and have fun everyone, let's kick cancer straight to the moon <3
Felt compelled to donate after that awesome Control run. Keep up the good work ACDQ!
Completely forgot the event moved here to Orlando. Forgot to register in time to attend this year. Here’s some $$$ instead.
Props to the dancing queens/kings
Donating for Hat Girl and Dancing Blue Shirt guy! Keeping the stream interesting
Hey guys. Recently the trauma center speedrunning community made my day by stopping by my annual weeks of trauma center streams when I jokingly tagged one of the streams as "Speedrun." Shoutouts to all the people who were accidentally duped, and shoutouts to all the people to stayed to watch anyways.
Great Control run! It was a lot of fun/catharsis! I am amazed/envious of how fast you got through fights that took me days. Control is really cool!Looking forward to Tony Hawk Project 8 later tonight, and putting it towards the Any% run of Goose Game. Honk/Honk!(If the GDQ site adds numbers to my name ignore them, it's simply TheMasterDS)
Big shootout to the rabbit ears in the front row! Left thumb, right thumb, left thumb, right thumb, both thumbs, both thumbs! Keep that positive energy going! You are a treasure!
Huge shout out to floppy hat girl for making my choice to say up very late well worth it also let's prevent cancer
this one is from our couch to bunny ears keep going!
Another year, another week of AMAZING speed runs. Thank you to all runners, hosts, tech crew, and everyone else who helps to put on this event.
I'm so glad this game is getting a second opinion at GDQ! Not only are you treating cancer in-game with anime surgery, but you're raising money to help cancer in real life. Can't wait to see what a true medical prodigy can do with one of my favorite series under the knife!
Honk
Love Games Done Quick, been watching for 5 years! Thank you for putting on such a fun event for a great cause! Excited to watch some surgeries! Hello from Japan!
Appreciate all you do and the enthusiasm that goes with it. Have a great AGDQ!
Here's to hitting that honking big goal, of the Mario Maker TAS block!
Wherever you go in life, there you are. :)
Greetings from the back couch - it’s finally time for some surgeries done quick! :D
Greetings from Germany. I love the whole event.
Hey Thurler, just play perfect. You can do that, right? It's not like stars are hard. Or this game is hard. Or that Atlus demands insane feats of malpractice. Or that stars are hard. Wish I could cheer you on in person. You've got this.Shoutouts to the Rural Fire Service.
gotta skate fast and donate cash!
Second donation this year but I'm so hype for this Trauma Centre run! Greetings from New Caledonia
Good luck, doctors. OR R U DOKTURZ???
Just woke up 4:30 am only to watch the Trauma Center: New Blood run and to donate during it, I love this action game. I'm really curious on how will the two episodes where you must apply a bunch of membranes to a liver will work out on an all XS ranks, I was playing the game this week and got XS on those after many tries, haha. Good luck on this run, donation can go towards runner's choice!PS: can I get someone in the couch to say "mixed vegetables" for absolutely no reason?
Trauma Center? At GDQ? The Medical Board has been notified! Incentives go to runner's choice.
You might have doubted it, but I am fully awake for your run! At least, I think I am... Just for you to know we’re having lots of fun on the brazilian restream, besides the time. I’m sure the run is gonna be awesome, so be sure to show the world how to be a star in surgeries. And, of course, how to draw the best stars!
Paging Dr. Thurler, paging Dr. Thurler. Best of luck on your run! We are really proud to see you at this amazing event!Together we are stronger against CancerCheers from SpeedrunsBrasil! #GoThurler #OFFICIAL
Merci à toute l’équipe organisatrice et au french resteam. Toujours un plaisir de suivre une AGDQ/SGDQ, pour la bonne cause en plus. Bisous
Good luck to all runners. Have fun!
Nothing witty to say here. I just NEED that “Sekiro” watercolor!
This is donation is for my dad who just successfully underwent esophogeal cancer and is currently healing. Thank you for everything you GDQ!!!!
If only a WiiMote could help prevent cancer, oh wait, it kind of is! Good luck to all the runners! Hype!
This was my first Trauma Center game and I still can't get most XS ranks, so seeing an all XS in a marathon is insane. Good luck on the run.
The plot of this game makes no sense, the motion controls are janky, and yet I still adore this game series. Thanks for the great run, and for making these ridiculous surgeries look easy
I'm a third year medical student that just finished his surgical clerkship several weeks ago. Just when I thought I suturing couldn't be more stress inducing with an attending and resident watching your every move, I can't help but think what it'd be like to have a Wii mote instead of a needle driver. Thanks for the entertaining stream while I study for my shelf exams.
Thurler, if we could just cure cancer through this game, we would be looking amazing. Here is my money; take it.
Cool, le mauvais temps. C'est une bonne excuse pour passer la journée devant l'AGDQ. #MarioLight
I also need the Sculptor’s Idol or Bonfire, so here’s another $30.
As an Alaskan, I am required to say two things about Trauma Center: New Blood.1) Fairbanks, which is stated to be the city in question, isn't THAT rural, it's tens of thousands of people and has a modern hospital. Kinda important, given it's the only hospital for over a thousand miles for the actually rural villages!2) The flags outside the hospital are the US flag... And a blank black flag. Alaska's flag is not, in fact, a blank black flag.Still a great game, still an excellent run.
Dr. Hoffman checking in from Second Opinion to remind you kids: don't forget to eat your Cranberries! Gotta get strong so you can do surgery fast.
Been loving this AGDQ so far lets see all those bonuses met.
J'ai toujours voulu me faire opérer par le Dr House !#DarkMage
Green cash for green defibs! (Hey, it worked last time.) Excited for people to see the best speedrun ever, run by a very entertaining runner. Good luck Thurler!
It's 3AM, I'm panicking, my palms are sweaty, and my eyes are burning from watching medical malpractice. Man I thought I was done with this when I quit phlebotomy.In all seriousness, always happy to see Trauma Center games run during AGDQ. Hi to everyone on the couch, and good luck to Thurler on the run!
Trauma Center is one of my favorite series of all time. Each XS rank in New Blood was a struggle to get, so it's amazing seeing them all done in a speedrun! Best of luck, and here's $10 for each strain of Stigma.
Thank you for a great agdq once again, and thank you for making it for such a good cause!
I'm rather inebriated but this game seems cool! Kick cancer to the curb, keep fighting everyone affected
Trauma Center was a trauma to me :D i failed so much in this game. This Speedrun is so great to watch, keep the magic healing poition ready for beating all cancer in the world ! Greetings from Bavaria Germany
Hello from Scotland! This is my first time catching GDQ live, and I just had to donate during the Trauma Center run. I've only ever beat Under The Knife on the DS, and that was using Action Replay cheats, so I know when I'm beat!I lost my mum to cancer when I was eight years old, and just last year my partner was diagnosed. He's now in remission, and I just want to say that I'm so glad that cancer research has come so far since my childhood.Good luck with the run guys, and lets get an XS rank for beating cancer!
first time watching GDQ live. so excited to learn valuable medical knowledge from this run!!!
