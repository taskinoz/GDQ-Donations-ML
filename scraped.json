After an entire year of endless visits, and medical tests to eliminate all possibilities, he was finally diagnosed with a rare case of Hodgkins lymphoma. He has ended his final bout of treatment, with his last scan in 2 weeks to confirm his chemo has eradicated all remnants of this terrible disease. His nurses in my local cancer ward have been so supportive though every step of the healing process, and I have nothing but the highest respect for any medical staff helping all others who are going through this too. I couldn't think of a better time to donate to the Prevent Cancer Foundation than during a run from one of my favourite franchises of all time, one of the few franchises in which I have perfected practically every installment.

So, in order to make him laugh, here's a joke. Why did episode 4, 5, and 6 come out before 1, 2, and 3? (Read in best Yoda voice to unlock another $10) Because in charge of directing, Yoda was.\n","603961":"","603962":"\nThe true Force Power is Quake 3 momentum physics.\n","603963":"\nIf everybody is watching donates 5 bucks it would really be a nice 700,000.

Had to donate when I saw an unmet Myst incentive.\n","603981":"","603982":"","603983":"\nI feel like donating covertmuffin himself to the prevent cancer foundation for extensive research on the effect his laugh is having on cancer could prove extremely useful since I haven't heard a laugh as cancer-curing as his ever before. Looking forward to his runs every time!Greetings from Berlin, Germany.\n","603984":"\nNice\n","603985":"\nRosh?

Perfect time to do it during my favourite game! Thanks to everyone who makes this event happen.I've been meaning to donate earlier than this but never got around to doing it. Now I feel more incentivized to donating since last year, in Febuary, my amazing mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even though she is now declared cancer free thanks to early detection, all of us in the family have been affected by her going through treatment and cancer is never a good time (except in this very game). I hope that the money I can spare can go towards saving lives in the same way my mother-in-law's was. Come on now stream, let's try to beat this disease together!

We know this is a big change from the style of gameplay seen in Breath of the Wild, but we think it will be a welcome one.(read the next line out loud):Announcer, can you give me the best HONK you can muster?

Her condition went down incredibly fast and she passed away less than 3 weeks later on December 21st. She was only 58 years old. Nobody deserves this. I am grateful for everything AGDQ does for Prevent Cancer. Sonic the Hedgehog was my entire childhood and my mom would always get me everything Sonic related I wanted. She was a great mother and it's thanks to her that I am the way I am now. Good luck to everyone at AGDQ and especially those who are playing the blue blur's games :)\n","607983":"\nI really want that fast rodent pillow.
