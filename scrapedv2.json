Perfect time to do it during my favourite game! Thanks to everyone who makes this event happen.I've been meaning to donate earlier than this but never got around to doing it. Now I feel more incentivized to donating since last year, in Febuary, my amazing mother-in-law was diagnosed with breast cancer. Even though she is now declared cancer free thanks to early detection, all of us in the family have been affected by her going through treatment and cancer is never a good time (except in this very game). I hope that the money I can spare can go towards saving lives in the same way my mother-in-law's was. Come on now stream, let's try to beat this disease together!

They were initially designed for Final Fantasy 7, where they would be mercenaries that pursued Avalaunche. This role was eventually merged with the Turks and they were scrapped only to be brought back for FF8. Raijin's trademark 'ya know' is actually a translation of a fairly well know Yakuza saying, which give his lines a lot more menace in the original Japanese, whereas Fujin's remarks are a bit of a mis-translation. Originally, she speaks in Kanji characters as opposed to full sentaces, which is meant to imply that she is being curt and to the point, but the all caps gives her an impression of yelling which is not correct. When the character was reused in Kingdom Hearts, they changed her text box style to reflect this.

Lynch Syndrome is a gene mutation that is passed along through families and it raises the likelihood of a person who is diagnosed with it getting cancer the older they get. For example, the risk of getting bowel cancer with Lynch goes up to 80%. My dad passed away from cancer along with two of his brothers and his mum/my grandma. All of them also had Lynch Syndrome. Thanks to being diagnosed I can now be under careful watch for the rest of my life to prevent cancer from taking me too soon. Donating to a cause that helps to prevent cancer can make a difference to so many people, but I also want to add that watching speed runs has helped me tremendously too, particularly Zelda runs. On that note, here’s a shout out to Zfg for probably taking most of my speed run watching hours, seriously looking forward to the OoT run. Good luck to all of those left to run and please, if you have a history of specific type of cancers running in your family, do consider genetic testing for preventative purposes!

One day, in the middle of an Econ lecture, I got a phone call from Hans: He had gone, on a whim, for one of those psych study MRIs. They pulled him out immediately and told him they couldn’t use him for the study: he had a brain tumor. We don’t know when, or if, he would have been diagnosed otherwise; this unplanned visit saved his life. Early detection matters. And I’m honored to contribute just a little in his name to the Prevent Cancer Foundation.Hans had close to a decade cancer free, but now, he has been in an out of treatment. I’m grateful for the time he’s had, and hope everyone listening takes a moment to wish him well in his treatment now and think of the moments, the lives, they can save, through contributing to early detection and treatment.With Love, Troy","id":623086,"time":"01/09/2020 05:23:58 +0000","amount":null},{"text":"Really excited to donate during one of my favorite games of the year.

I'm hype for Salvner's run, his YouTube got me into Subnautica and he absolutely kills it. By the way, it might seem like I'm breaking these rocks rather quickly. That's because I've bound my scroll wheel to the action button, which is fantastic because usually to break and pick these rocks takes 4 clicks. This only works on high FPS. Good luck on the run, save some baby leviathans.... and maybe some frames too.","id":631750,"time":"01/10/2020 07:30:30 +0000","amount":10},{"text":"I have been a long time watcher and I just want to say you guys are amazing me and my wife watch you guys all the time and we are expecting are first child here soon","id":631751,"time":"01/10/2020 07:30:33 +0000","amount":25},{"text":"","id":631752,"time":"","amount":null},{"text":"salvner, be epic as usual, swim with the current, and good teeth/nickel RNG with a greeting from South Africa -- Matya","id":631753,"time":"01/10/2020 07:30:42 +0000","amount":100},{"text":"I lost a very dear friend to cancer, she fought three different times and beat it twice.
